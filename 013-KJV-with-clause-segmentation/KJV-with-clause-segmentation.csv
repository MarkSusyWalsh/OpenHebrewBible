c1	In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.
c2	And the earth was without form, and void;
c3	and darkness <i>was</i> upon the face of the deep.
c4	And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.
c5	And God said,
c6	Let there be light:
c7	and there was light.
c8	And God saw the light,
c9	that <i>it was</i> good:
c10	and God divided the light from the darkness.
c11	And God called the light Day,
c12	and the darkness he called Night.
c13	And the evening and the morning were
c15	the first day.
c16	And God said,
c17	Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters,
c18	and let it divide the waters from the waters.
c19	And God made the firmament,
c20	and divided the waters
c21	which <i>were</i> under the firmament
c22	from the waters
c23	which <i>were</i> above the firmament:
c24	and it was so.
c25	And God called the firmament Heaven.
c26	And the evening and the morning were
c28	the second day.
c29	And God said,
c30	Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place,
c31	and let the dry <i>land</i> appear:
c32	and it was so.
c33	And God called the dry <i>land</i> Earth;
c34	and the gathering together of the waters called he Seas:
c35	and God saw
c36	that <i>it was</i> good.
c37	And God said,
c38	Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb
c39	yielding seed,
c40	<i>and</i> the fruit tree
c41	yielding fruit after his kind,
c42	whose seed
c43	<i>is</i> in itself, upon the earth:
c44	and it was so.
c45	And the earth brought forth grass, <i>and</i> herb
c46	yielding seed after his kind,
c47	and the tree
c48	yielding fruit,
c49	whose seed
c50	<i>was</i> in itself, after his kind:
c51	and God saw
c52	that <i>it was</i> good.
c53	And the evening and the morning were
c55	the third day.
c56	And God said,
c57	Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven
c58	to divide the day from the night;
c59	and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years:
c60	And let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven
c61	to give light upon the earth:
c62	and it was so.
c63	And God made two great lights;
c64	the greater light to rule the day,
c65	and the lesser light to rule the night:
c66	<i>he made</i> the stars also.
c67	And God set them in the firmament of the heaven
c68	to give light upon the earth,
c69	And to rule over the day and over the night,
c70	and to divide the light from the darkness:
c71	and God saw
c72	that <i>it was</i> good.
c73	And the evening and the morning were
c75	the fourth day.
c76	And God said,
c77	Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving creature that hath life,
c78	and fowl <i>that</i> may fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven.
c79	And God created great whales, and every living creature
c81	that moveth,
c82	which the waters brought forth abundantly,
c83	after their kind,
c84	and every winged fowl after his kind:
c85	and God saw
c86	that <i>it was</i> good.
c87	And God blessed
c88	them, saying,
c89	Be fruitful,
c90	and multiply,
c91	and fill the waters in the seas,
c92	and let fowl multiply in the earth.
c93	And the evening and the morning were
c95	the fifth day.
c96	And God said,
c97	Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind,
c98	cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after his kind:
c99	and it was so.
c100	And God made the beast of the earth after his kind,
c101	and cattle after their kind,
c102	and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind:
c103	and God saw
c104	that <i>it was</i> good.
c105	And God said,
c106	Let us make man in our image, after our likeness:
c107	and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing
c108	that creepeth upon the earth.
c109	So God created man in his <i>own</i> image,
c110	in the image of God created
c111	he him; male and female created he them.
c112	And God blessed
c113	them, and God said
c114	unto them, Be fruitful,
c115	and multiply,
c116	and replenish the earth,
c117	and subdue
c118	it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing
c119	that moveth upon the earth.
c120	And God said,
c121	Behold, I have given you every herb
c122	bearing seed,
c123	which <i>is</i> upon the face of all the earth,
c124	and every tree,
c125	in the which <i>is</i> the fruit of a tree
c126	yielding seed;
c127	to you it shall be for meat.
c128	And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth,
c129	wherein <i>there is</i> life,
c130	<i>I have given</i> every green herb for meat:
c131	and it was so.
c132	And God saw every thing
c133	that he had made,
c134	and, behold, <i>it was</i> very good.
c135	And the evening and the morning were
c137	the sixth day.
c138	Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them.
c139	And on the seventh day God ended his work
c140	which he had made;
c141	and he rested on the seventh day from all his work
c142	which he had made.
c143	And God blessed the seventh day,
c144	and sanctified
c145	it: because that in it he had rested from all his work
c146	which God created
c147	and made.
c148	These <i>are</i> the generations of the heavens and of the earth
c149	when they were created,
c150	in the day
c151	that the LORD God made the earth and the heavens,
c152	And every plant of the field before it was in the earth,
c153	and every herb of the field before it grew:
c154	for the LORD God had not caused it to rain upon the earth,
c155	and <i>there was</i> not a man
c156	to till the ground.
c157	But there went up a mist from the earth,
c158	and watered the whole face of the ground.
c159	And the LORD God formed man <i>of</i> the dust of the ground,
c160	and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life;
c161	and man became a living soul.
c162	And the LORD God planted a garden eastward in Eden;
c163	and there he put the man
c164	whom he had formed.
c165	And out of the ground made the LORD God to grow every tree
c166	that is pleasant to the sight,
c167	and good for food;
c168	the tree of life also in the midst of the garden,
c169	and the tree of knowledge of good and evil.
c170	And a river went out of Eden
c171	to water the garden;
c172	and from thence it was parted,
c173	and became into four heads.
c174	The name of the first <i>is</i> Pison:
c175	that <i>is</i> it
c176	which compasseth the whole land of Havilah,
c177	where <i>there is</i> gold;
c178	And the gold of that land <i>is</i> good:
c179	there <i>is</i> bdellium and the onyx stone.
c180	And the name of the second river <i>is</i> Gihon:
c181	the same
c182	<i>is</i> it that compasseth the whole land of Ethiopia.
c183	And the name of the third river <i>is</i> Hiddekel:
c184	that <i>is</i> it
c185	which goeth toward the east of Assyria.
c186	And the fourth river
c187	<i>is</i> Euphrates.
c188	And the LORD God took the man,
c189	and put him into the garden of Eden
c190	to dress
c191	it and to keep it.
c192	And the LORD God commanded the man,
c193	saying,
c194	Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat:
c195	But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil,
c196	thou shalt not eat of
c197	it: for in the day
c198	that thou eatest thereof
c199	thou shalt surely die.
c200	And the LORD God said,
c201	<i>It is</i> not good
c202	that the man should be alone;
c203	I will make him an help meet for him.
c204	And out of the ground the LORD God formed every beast of the field, and every fowl of the air;
c205	and brought <i>them</i> unto Adam
c206	to see
c207	what he would call them:
c208	and whatsoever
c209	Adam called every living creature,
c210	that <i>was</i> the name thereof.
c211	And Adam gave names to all cattle, and to the fowl of the air, and to every beast of the field;
c212	but for Adam there was not found an help meet for him.
c213	And the LORD God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam,
c214	and he slept:
c215	and he took one of his ribs,
c216	and closed up the flesh instead thereof;
c217	And the rib, which the LORD God had taken from man, made
c219	he a woman,
c220	and brought her unto the man.
c221	And Adam said,
c222	This <i>is</i> now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh:
c223	she shall be called Woman,
c224	because she was taken out of Man.
c225	Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother,
c226	and shall cleave unto his wife:
c227	and they shall be one flesh.
c228	And they were both naked, the man and his wife,
c229	and were not ashamed.
c230	Now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field
c231	which the LORD God had made.
c232	And he said unto the woman,
c233	Yea, hath God said,
c234	Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden?
c235	And the woman said unto the serpent,
c236	We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden:
c237	But of the fruit of the tree
c238	which <i>is</i> in the midst of the garden,
c239	God hath said,
c240	Ye shall not eat of
c241	it, neither shall ye touch
c242	it, lest ye die.
c243	And the serpent said unto the woman,
c244	Ye shall not surely die:
c245	For God doth know
c246	that in the day
c247	ye eat thereof,
c248	then your eyes shall be opened,
c249	and ye shall be as gods,
c250	knowing good and evil.
c251	And when the woman saw
c252	that the tree <i>was</i> good for food,
c253	and that it <i>was</i> pleasant to the eyes,
c254	and a tree to be desired
c255	to make <i>one</i> wise,
c256	she took of the fruit
c257	thereof, and did eat,
c258	and gave also unto her husband with
c259	her; and he did eat.
c260	And the eyes of them both were opened,
c261	and they knew
c262	that they <i>were</i> naked;
c263	and they sewed fig leaves
c264	together, and made themselves aprons.
c265	And they heard the voice of the LORD God
c266	walking in the garden in the cool of the day:
c267	and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the LORD God amongst the trees of the garden.
c268	And the LORD God called unto Adam,
c269	and said
c270	unto him, Where <i>art</i> thou?
c271	And he said,
c272	I heard thy voice in the garden,
c273	and I was afraid,
c274	because I <i>was</i> naked;
c275	and I hid myself.
c276	And he said,
c277	Who told
c278	thee that thou <i>wast</i> naked?
c280	whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not
c281	Hast thou eaten of the tree,
c282	eat?
c283	And the man said,
c284	The woman
c285	whom thou gavest <i>to be</i> with
c286	me, she gave me of the tree,
c287	and I did eat.
c288	And the LORD God said unto the woman,
c289	What <i>is</i> this <i>that</i> thou hast done?
c290	And the woman said,
c291	The serpent beguiled
c292	me, and I did eat.
c293	And the LORD God said unto the serpent,
c294	Because thou hast done this,
c295	thou <i>art</i> cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the field;
c296	upon thy belly shalt thou go,
c297	and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life:
c298	And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed;
c299	it shall bruise thy head,
c300	and thou shalt bruise his heel.
c301	Unto the woman he said,
c302	I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception;
c303	in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children;
c304	and thy desire <i>shall be</i> to thy husband,
c305	and he shall rule over thee.
c306	And unto Adam he said,
c307	Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife,
c308	and hast eaten of the tree,
c309	of which I commanded
c310	thee, saying,
c311	Thou shalt not eat of
c312	it: cursed <i>is</i> the ground for thy sake;
c313	in sorrow shalt thou eat <i>of</i> it all the days of thy life;
c314	Thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth
c315	to thee; and thou shalt eat the herb of the field;
c316	In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread,
c317	till thou return unto the ground;
c318	for out of it wast thou taken:
c319	for dust thou
c320	<i>art,</i> and unto dust shalt thou return.
c321	And Adam called his wife's name Eve;
c322	because she was the mother of all living.
c323	Unto Adam also and to his wife did the LORD God make coats of skins,
c324	and clothed them.
c325	And the LORD God said,
c326	Behold, the man is become as one of
c327	us, to know good and evil:
c328	and now,
c329	lest he put forth his hand,
c330	and take also of the tree of life,
c331	and eat,
c332	and live for ever:
c333	Therefore the LORD God sent him forth from the garden of Eden,
c334	to till the ground
c335	from whence he was taken.
c336	So he drove out the man;
c337	and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden Cherubims, and a flaming sword
c338	which turned every way,
c339	to keep the way of the tree of life.
c340	And Adam knew Eve his wife;
c341	and she conceived,
c342	and bare Cain,
c343	and said,
c344	I have gotten a man from the LORD.
c345	And she again
c346	bare his brother Abel.
c347	And Abel was a keeper of sheep,
c348	but Cain was a tiller of the ground.
c349	And in process of time it came to pass,
c350	that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering unto the LORD.
c351	And Abel, he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat
c352	thereof. And the LORD had respect unto Abel and to his offering:
c353	But unto Cain and to his offering he had not respect.
c354	And Cain was very wroth,
c355	and his countenance fell.
c356	And the LORD said unto Cain,
c357	Why art thou wroth?
c358	and why is thy countenance fallen?
c359	shalt thou not
c360	If thou doest well,
c361	be accepted?
c362	and if thou doest not well,
c363	sin lieth at the door.
c364	And unto thee <i>shall be</i> his desire,
c365	and thou shalt rule over him.
c366	And Cain talked with Abel his brother:
c367	and it came to pass,
c368	when they were in the field,
c369	that Cain rose up against Abel his brother,
c370	and slew him.
c371	And the LORD said unto Cain,
c372	Where <i>is</i> Abel thy brother?
c373	And he said,
c374	I know not:
c375	<i>Am</i> I my brother's keeper?
c376	And he said,
c377	What hast thou done?
c378	the voice of thy brother's blood crieth unto me from the ground.
c379	And now
c380	<i>art</i> thou cursed from the earth,
c381	which hath opened her mouth
c382	to receive thy brother's blood from thy hand;
c383	When thou tillest the ground,
c384	it shall not henceforth
c385	yield unto thee her strength;
c386	a fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be in the earth.
c387	And Cain said unto the LORD,
c388	My punishment <i>is</i> greater
c389	than I can bear.
c390	Behold, thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the earth;
c391	and from thy face shall I be hid;
c392	and I shall be a fugitive and a vagabond in the earth;
c393	and it shall come to pass,
c394	<i>that</i> every one
c395	that findeth
c396	me shall slay me.
c397	And the LORD said
c398	unto him, Therefore
c399	whosoever slayeth Cain, vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold.
c400	And the LORD set a mark upon Cain,
c401	lest any finding him should kill him.
c402	And Cain went out from the presence of the LORD,
c403	and dwelt in the land of Nod, on the east of Eden.
c404	And Cain knew his wife;
c405	and she conceived,
c406	and bare Enoch:
c407	and he builded
c408	a city,
c409	and called the name of the city, after the name of his son, Enoch.
c410	And unto Enoch was born Irad:
c411	and Irad begat Mehujael:
c412	and Mehujael begat Methusael:
c413	and Methusael begat Lamech.
c414	And Lamech took unto him two wives:
c415	the name of the one <i>was</i> Adah,
c416	and the name of the other Zillah.
c417	And Adah bare Jabal:
c418	he was the father of such as dwell in tents, and <i>of such as have</i> cattle.
c419	And his brother's name <i>was</i> Jubal:
c420	he was the father of all such as handle the harp and organ.
c421	And Zillah, she also bare Tubalcain,
c422	an instructer of every artificer in brass and iron:
c423	and the sister of Tubalcain <i>was</i> Naamah.
c424	And Lamech said unto his wives, Adah and Zillah,
c425	Hear my voice;
c426	ye wives of Lamech,
c427	hearken unto my speech:
c428	for I have slain a man to my wounding,
c429	and a young man to my hurt.
c430	If Cain shall be avenged sevenfold,
c431	truly Lamech seventy and sevenfold.
c432	And Adam knew his wife again;
c433	and she bare a son,
c434	and called his name Seth:
c435	For God, <i>said she,</i> hath appointed me another seed instead of Abel,
c436	whom Cain slew.
c437	And to Seth, to him also there was born a son;
c438	and he called his name Enos:
c439	then began
c440	men to call upon the name of the LORD.
c441	This <i>is</i> the book of the generations of Adam.
c442	In the day
c443	that God created man,
c444	in the likeness of God made he him;
c445	Male and female created
c446	he them; and blessed
c447	them, and called their name Adam, in the day
c448	when they were created.
c449	And Adam lived an hundred and thirty years,
c450	and begat <i>a son</i> in his own likeness, after his image;
c451	and called his name Seth:
c452	And the days of Adam after he had begotten Seth were
c454	eight hundred years:
c455	and he begat sons and daughters:
c456	And all the days that Adam lived were
c458	nine hundred and thirty years:
c459	and he died.
c460	And Seth lived an hundred and five years,
c461	and begat Enos:
c462	And Seth lived
c463	after he begat Enos
c464	eight hundred and seven years,
c465	and begat sons and daughters:
c466	And all the days of Seth were nine hundred and twelve years:
c467	and he died.
c468	And Enos lived ninety years,
c469	and begat Cainan:
c470	And Enos lived
c471	after he begat Cainan
c472	eight hundred and fifteen years,
c473	and begat sons and daughters:
c474	And all the days of Enos were nine hundred and five years:
c475	and he died.
c476	And Cainan lived seventy years,
c477	and begat Mahalaleel:
c478	And Cainan lived
c479	after he begat Mahalaleel
c480	eight hundred and forty years,
c481	and begat sons and daughters:
c482	And all the days of Cainan were nine hundred and ten years:
c483	and he died.
c484	And Mahalaleel lived sixty and five years,
c485	and begat Jared:
c486	And Mahalaleel lived
c487	after he begat Jared
c488	eight hundred and thirty years,
c489	and begat sons and daughters:
c490	And all the days of Mahalaleel were eight hundred ninety and five years:
c491	and he died.
c492	And Jared lived an hundred sixty and two years,
c493	and he begat Enoch:
c494	And Jared lived
c495	after he begat Enoch
c496	eight hundred years,
c497	and begat sons and daughters:
c498	And all the days of Jared were nine hundred sixty and two years:
c499	and he died.
c500	And Enoch lived sixty and five years,
c501	and begat Methuselah:
c502	And Enoch walked with God
c503	after he begat Methuselah
c504	three hundred years,
c505	and begat sons and daughters:
c506	And all the days of Enoch were three hundred sixty and five years:
c507	And Enoch walked with God:
c508	and he <i>was</i> not;
c509	for God took him.
c510	And Methuselah lived an hundred eighty and seven years,
c511	and begat Lamech:
c512	And Methuselah lived
c513	after he begat Lamech
c514	seven hundred eighty and two years,
c515	and begat sons and daughters:
c516	And all the days of Methuselah were nine hundred sixty and nine years:
c517	and he died.
c518	And Lamech lived an hundred eighty and two years,
c519	and begat a son:
c520	And he called his name Noah,
c521	saying,
c522	This <i>same</i> shall comfort us concerning our work and toil of our hands, because of the ground
c523	which the LORD hath cursed.
c524	And Lamech lived
c525	after he begat Noah
c526	five hundred ninety and five years,
c527	and begat sons and daughters:
c528	And all the days of Lamech were seven hundred seventy and seven years:
c529	and he died.
c530	And Noah was five hundred years old:
c531	and Noah begat Shem, Ham, and Japheth.
c532	And it came to pass,
c533	when men began
c534	to multiply on the face of the earth,
c535	and daughters were born unto them,
c536	That the sons of God saw the daughters of men
c537	that they <i>were</i> fair;
c538	and they took them wives of all
c539	which they chose.
c540	And the LORD said,
c541	My spirit shall not always strive with man,
c542	for that he also <i>is</i> flesh:
c543	yet his days shall be an hundred and twenty years.
c544	There were giants in the earth in those days;
c545	and also after that,
c546	when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men,
c547	and they bare
c548	<i>children</i> to them, the same <i>became</i> mighty men
c549	which <i>were</i> of old,
c550	men of renown.
c551	And GOD saw
c552	that the wickedness of man <i>was</i> great in the earth,
c553	and <i>that</i> every imagination of the thoughts of his heart <i>was</i> only evil continually.
c554	And it repented the LORD
c555	that he had made man on the earth,
c556	and it grieved him at his heart.
c557	And the LORD said,
c558	I will destroy man
c559	whom I have created
c560	from the face of the earth; both man, and beast, and the creeping thing, and the fowls of the air;
c561	for it repenteth
c562	me that I have made them.
c563	But Noah found grace in the eyes of the LORD.
c564	These <i>are</i> the generations of Noah:
c565	Noah was a just man <i>and</i> perfect in his generations,
c566	<i>and</i> Noah walked with God.
c567	And Noah begat three sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth.
c568	The earth also was corrupt before God,
c569	and the earth was filled with violence.
c570	And God looked upon the earth,
c571	and, behold, it was corrupt;
c572	for all flesh had corrupted his way upon the earth.
c573	And God said unto Noah,
c574	The end of all flesh is come before
c575	me; for the earth is filled with violence through them;
c576	and, behold, I will destroy them with the earth.
c577	Make thee an ark of gopher wood;
c578	rooms shalt thou make in the ark,
c579	and shalt pitch it within and without with pitch.
c580	And this
c581	<i>is the fashion</i> which thou shalt make
c582	it <i>of:</i> The length of the ark <i>shall be</i> three hundred cubits,
c583	the breadth of it fifty cubits,
c584	and the height of it thirty cubits.
c585	A window shalt thou make to the ark,
c586	and in a cubit shalt thou finish it above;
c587	and the door of the ark shalt thou set in the side
c588	thereof; <i>with</i> lower, second, and third <i>stories</i> shalt thou make it.
c590	And, behold, I, even I, do bring a flood of waters upon the earth,
c591	to destroy all flesh,
c592	wherein <i>is</i> the breath of life,
c593	from under heaven;
c594	<i>and</i> every thing
c595	that <i>is</i> in the earth
c596	shall die.
c597	But with thee will I establish my covenant;
c598	and thou shalt come into the ark, thou, and thy sons, and thy wife, and thy sons' wives with thee.
c599	And of every living thing of all flesh,
c600	two of every <i>sort</i> shalt thou bring into the ark,
c601	to keep <i>them</i> alive with
c602	thee; they shall be male and female.
c603	Of fowls after their kind, and of cattle after their kind, of every creeping thing of the earth after his kind,
c604	two of every <i>sort</i> shall come unto
c605	thee, to keep <i>them</i> alive.
c606	And take thou unto thee of all food
c607	that is eaten,
c608	and thou shalt gather <i>it</i> to
c609	thee; and it shall be for food for thee, and for them.
c610	Thus did Noah; according to all
c611	that God commanded
c612	him, so did he.
c613	And the LORD said unto Noah,
c614	Come thou and all thy house into the ark;
c615	for thee have I seen righteous before me in this generation.
c616	Of every clean beast thou shalt take to thee by sevens, the male and his female:
c617	and of beasts
c618	that <i>are</i> not clean
c619	by two, the male and his female.
c620	Of fowls also of the air by sevens, the male and the female;
c621	to keep seed alive upon the face of all the earth.
c622	For yet seven days, and I will cause it to rain upon the earth forty days and forty nights;
c623	and every living substance that I have made will I destroy
c625	from off the face of the earth.
c626	And Noah did according unto all
c627	that the LORD commanded him.
c628	And Noah <i>was</i> six hundred years old
c629	when the flood of waters was
c630	upon the earth.
c631	And Noah went in, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons' wives with him, into the ark, because of the waters of the flood.
c632	Of clean beasts, and of beasts
c633	that <i>are</i> not clean,
c634	and of fowls, and of every thing
c635	that creepeth upon the earth,
c636	There went in two and two unto Noah into the ark, the male and the female,
c637	as God had commanded Noah.
c638	And it came to pass after seven days,
c639	that the waters of the flood were upon the earth.
c640	In the six hundredth year of Noah's life, in the second month, the seventeenth day of the month, the same day were all the fountains of the great deep broken up,
c641	and the windows of heaven were opened.
c642	And the rain was upon the earth forty days and forty nights.
c643	In the selfsame day entered Noah, and Shem, and Ham, and Japheth, the sons of Noah, and Noah's wife, and the three wives of his sons with them, into the ark;
c644	They, and every beast after his kind, and all the cattle after their kind, and every creeping thing
c645	that creepeth upon the earth
c646	after his kind, and every fowl after his kind, every bird of every sort.
c647	And they went in unto Noah into the ark, two and two of all flesh,
c648	wherein <i>is</i> the breath of life.
c650	And they that went in,
c651	went in male and female of all flesh,
c652	as God had commanded
c653	him: and the LORD shut him in.
c654	And the flood was forty days upon the earth;
c655	and the waters increased,
c656	and bare up the ark,
c657	and it was lift up above the earth.
c658	And the waters prevailed,
c659	and were increased greatly upon the earth;
c660	and the ark went upon the face of the waters.
c661	And the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth;
c662	and all the high hills, that <i>were</i> under the whole heaven, were covered.
c664	Fifteen cubits upward did the waters prevail;
c665	and the mountains were covered.
c666	And all flesh died
c667	that moved upon the earth,
c668	both of fowl, and of cattle, and of beast, and of every creeping thing
c669	that creepeth upon the earth,
c670	and every man:
c671	All
c672	in whose nostrils <i>was</i> the breath of life, of all that
c674	<i>was</i> in the dry
c675	<i>land,</i> died.
c676	And every living substance was destroyed
c677	which was upon the face of the ground,
c678	both man, and cattle, and the creeping things, and the fowl of the heaven;
c679	and they were destroyed from the earth:
c680	and Noah only remained
c681	<i>alive,</i> and they that <i>were</i> with him in the ark.
c682	And the waters prevailed upon the earth an hundred and fifty days.
c683	And God remembered Noah, and every living thing, and all the cattle
c684	that <i>was</i> with him in the ark:
c685	and God made a wind to pass over the earth,
c686	and the waters asswaged;
c687	The fountains also of the deep and the windows of heaven were stopped,
c688	and the rain from heaven was restrained;
c689	And the waters returned from off the earth continually:
c690	and after the end of the hundred and fifty days the waters were abated.
c691	And the ark rested in the seventh month, on the seventeenth day of the month, upon the mountains of Ararat.
c692	And the waters decreased continually until the tenth month:
c693	in the tenth <i>month,</i> on the first <i>day</i> of the month, were the tops of the mountains seen.
c694	And it came to pass at the end of forty days,
c695	that Noah opened the window of the ark
c696	which he had made:
c697	And he sent forth a raven,
c698	which went forth to and fro,
c699	until the waters were dried up from off the earth.
c700	Also he sent forth a dove from
c701	him, to see
c702	if the waters were abated from off the face of the ground;
c703	But the dove found no rest for the sole of her foot,
c704	and she returned unto him into the ark,
c705	for the waters <i>were</i> on the face of the whole earth:
c706	then he put forth his hand,
c707	and took
c708	her, and pulled her in unto him into the ark.
c709	And he stayed yet other seven days;
c710	and again
c711	he sent forth the dove out of the ark;
c712	And the dove came in to him in the evening;
c713	and, lo, in her mouth <i>was</i> an olive leaf pluckt off:
c714	so Noah knew
c715	that the waters were abated from off the earth.
c716	And he stayed yet other seven days;
c717	and sent forth the dove;
c719	which returned not again unto him any more.
c720	And it came to pass
c721	in the six hundredth and first year, in the first <i>month,</i> the first <i>day</i> of the month, the waters were dried up from off the earth:
c722	and Noah removed the covering of the ark,
c723	and looked,
c724	and, behold, the face of the ground was dry.
c725	And in the second month, on the seven and twentieth day of the month, was the earth dried.
c726	And God spake unto Noah,
c727	saying,
c728	Go forth of the ark, thou, and thy wife, and thy sons, and thy sons' wives with thee.
c729	thee every living thing
c730	that <i>is</i> with
c731	thee, of all flesh, <i>both</i> of fowl, and of cattle, and of every creeping thing
c732	that creepeth upon the earth;
c733	Bring forth with
c734	that they may breed abundantly in the earth,
c735	and be fruitful,
c736	and multiply upon the earth.
c737	And Noah went forth, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons' wives with him:
c738	Every beast, every creeping thing, and every fowl, <i>and</i> whatsoever
c739	creepeth upon the earth,
c740	after their kinds, went forth out of the ark.
c741	And Noah builded an altar unto the LORD;
c742	and took of every clean beast, and of every clean fowl,
c743	and offered burnt offerings on the altar.
c744	And the LORD smelled a sweet savour;
c745	and the LORD said in his heart,
c746	I will not again
c747	curse the ground any more for man's sake;
c748	for the imagination of man's heart <i>is</i> evil from his youth;
c749	neither will I again smite any more
c750	every thing living,
c751	as I have done.
c752	While the earth remaineth, seedtime and harvest, and cold and heat, and summer and winter, and day and night shall not cease.
c753	And God blessed Noah and his sons,
c754	and said
c755	unto them, Be fruitful,
c756	and multiply,
c757	and replenish the earth.
c758	And the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of the earth, and upon every fowl of the air,
c759	upon all
c760	that moveth <i>upon</i> the earth,
c761	and upon all the fishes of the sea;
c762	into your hand are they delivered.
c763	Every moving thing
c764	that liveth
c765	shall be meat
c766	for you; even as the green herb have I given you all things.
c767	But flesh with the life thereof, <i>which is</i> the blood thereof, shall ye not eat.
c768	And surely your blood of your lives will I require;
c769	at the hand of every beast will I require
c770	it, and at the hand of man; at the hand of every man's brother will I require the life of man.
c771	Whoso sheddeth man's blood,
c772	by man shall his blood be shed:
c773	for in the image of God made he man.
c774	And you, be ye fruitful,
c775	and multiply;
c776	bring forth abundantly in the earth,
c777	and multiply therein.
c778	And God spake unto Noah, and to his sons with
c779	him, saying,
c780	And I,
c781	behold, I establish my covenant with you, and with your seed after you;
c782	And with every living creature
c783	that <i>is</i> with
c784	you, of the fowl, of the cattle, and of every beast of the earth with
c785	you; from all
c786	that go out of the ark,
c787	to every beast of the earth.
c788	And I will establish my covenant with
c789	you; neither shall all flesh be cut off any more by the waters of a flood;
c790	neither shall there any more be a flood
c791	to destroy the earth.
c792	And God said,
c793	This <i>is</i> the token of the covenant
c794	which I make between me and you and every living creature
c795	that <i>is</i> with
c796	you, for perpetual generations:
c797	I do set my bow in the cloud,
c798	and it shall be for a token of a covenant between me and the earth.
c799	And it shall come to pass,
c800	when I bring a cloud over the earth,
c801	that the bow shall be seen in the cloud:
c802	And I will remember my covenant,
c803	which <i>is</i> between me and you and every living creature of all flesh;
c804	and the waters shall no more become a flood
c805	to destroy all flesh.
c806	And the bow shall be in the cloud;
c807	and I will look upon
c808	it, that I may remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh
c809	that <i>is</i> upon the earth.
c810	And God said unto Noah,
c811	This <i>is</i> the token of the covenant,
c812	which I have established between me and all flesh
c813	that <i>is</i> upon the earth.
c814	And the sons of Noah, that went forth of the ark, were
c816	Shem, and Ham, and Japheth:
c817	and Ham
c818	<i>is</i> the father of Canaan.
c819	These <i>are</i> the three sons of Noah:
c820	and of them was the whole earth overspread.
c822	And Noah began <i>to be</i> an husbandman,
c823	and he planted a vineyard:
c824	And he drank of the wine,
c825	and was drunken;
c826	and he was uncovered within his tent.
c827	And Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father,
c828	and told his two brethren without.
c829	And Shem and Japheth took a garment,
c830	and laid <i>it</i> upon both their shoulders,
c831	and went backward,
c832	and covered the nakedness of their father;
c833	and their faces <i>were</i> backward,
c834	and they saw not their father's nakedness.
c835	And Noah awoke from his wine,
c836	and knew
c837	what his younger son had done unto him.
c838	And he said,
c839	Cursed <i>be</i> Canaan;
c840	a servant of servants shall he be unto his brethren.
c841	And he said,
c842	Blessed <i>be</i> the LORD God of Shem;
c843	and Canaan shall be his servant.
c844	God shall enlarge Japheth,
c845	and he shall dwell in the tents of Shem;
c846	and Canaan shall be his servant.
c847	And Noah lived after the flood three hundred and fifty years.
c848	And all the days of Noah were nine hundred and fifty years:
c849	and he died.
c850	Now these <i>are</i> the generations of the sons of Noah, Shem, Ham, and Japheth:
c851	and unto them were sons born after the flood.
c852	The sons of Japheth; Gomer, and Magog, and Madai, and Javan, and Tubal, and Meshech, and Tiras.
c853	And the sons of Gomer; Ashkenaz, and Riphath, and Togarmah.
c854	And the sons of Javan; Elishah, and Tarshish, Kittim, and Dodanim.
c855	By these were the isles of the Gentiles divided in their lands;
c856	every one after his tongue,
c857	after their families, in their nations.
c858	And the sons of Ham; Cush, and Mizraim, and Phut, and Canaan.
c859	And the sons of Cush; Seba, and Havilah, and Sabtah, and Raamah, and Sabtecha:
c860	and the sons of Raamah; Sheba, and Dedan.
c861	And Cush begat Nimrod:
c862	he began
c863	to be a mighty one in the earth.
c864	He was a mighty hunter before the LORD:
c865	wherefore it is said,
c866	Even as Nimrod the mighty hunter before the LORD.
c867	And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel, and Erech, and Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar.
c868	Out of that land went forth Asshur,
c869	and builded Nineveh, and the city Rehoboth, and Calah,
c870	And Resen between Nineveh and Calah:
c871	the same <i>is</i> a great city.
c872	And Mizraim begat Ludim, and Anamim, and Lehabim, and Naphtuhim,
c873	And Pathrusim, and Casluhim,
c874	(out of whom came Philistim,)
c875	and Caphtorim.
c876	And Canaan begat Sidon his firstborn, and Heth,
c877	And the Jebusite, and the Amorite, and the Girgasite,
c878	And the Hivite, and the Arkite, and the Sinite,
c879	And the Arvadite, and the Zemarite, and the Hamathite:
c880	and afterward were the families of the Canaanites spread abroad.
c881	And the border of the Canaanites was from Sidon,
c882	as thou comest to Gerar,
c883	unto Gaza;
c884	as thou goest, unto Sodom, and Gomorrah, and Admah, and Zeboim,
c885	even unto Lasha.
c886	These <i>are</i> the sons of Ham, after their families, after their tongues, in their countries, <i>and</i> in their nations.
c887	Unto Shem also, the father of all the children of Eber, the brother of Japheth the elder, even to him were <i>children</i> born.
c889	The children of Shem; Elam, and Asshur, and Arphaxad, and Lud, and Aram.
c890	And the children of Aram; Uz, and Hul, and Gether, and Mash.
c891	And Arphaxad begat Salah;
c892	and Salah begat Eber.
c893	And unto Eber were born two sons:
c894	the name of one <i>was</i> Peleg;
c895	for in his days was the earth divided;
c896	and his brother's name <i>was</i> Joktan.
c897	And Joktan begat Almodad, and Sheleph, and Hazarmaveth, and Jerah,
c898	And Hadoram, and Uzal, and Diklah,
c899	And Obal, and Abimael, and Sheba,
c900	And Ophir, and Havilah, and Jobab:
c901	all these <i>were</i> the sons of Joktan.
c902	And their dwelling was from Mesha,
c903	as thou goest unto Sephar a mount of the east.
c904	These <i>are</i> the sons of Shem, after their families, after their tongues, in their lands, after their nations.
c905	These <i>are</i> the families of the sons of Noah, after their generations, in their nations:
c906	and by these were the nations divided in the earth after the flood.
c907	And the whole earth was of one language, and of one speech.
c908	And it came to pass,
c909	as they journeyed from the east,
c910	that they found a plain in the land of Shinar;
c911	and they dwelt there.
c912	And they said
c913	one to another,
c914	Go to,
c915	let us make brick,
c916	and burn them throughly.
c917	And they had brick for stone,
c918	and slime had they for morter.
c919	And they said,
c920	Go to,
c921	let us build us a city and a tower,
c922	whose top <i>may reach</i> unto heaven;
c923	and let us make us a name,
c924	lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth.
c925	And the LORD came down
c926	to see the city and the tower,
c927	which the children of men builded.
c928	And the LORD said,
c929	Behold, the people <i>is</i> one,
c930	and they have all one language;
c931	and this
c932	they begin
c933	to do:
c934	and now nothing will be restrained from
c935	them, which they have imagined
c936	to do.
c937	Go to,
c938	let us go down,
c939	and there confound their language,
c940	that they may not understand
c941	one another's speech.
c942	So the LORD scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of all the earth:
c943	and they left off
c944	to build the city.
c945	Therefore is the name of it called Babel;
c946	because the LORD did there confound the language of all the earth:
c947	and from thence did the LORD scatter them abroad upon the face of all the earth.
c948	These <i>are</i> the generations of Shem:
c949	Shem <i>was</i> an hundred years old,
c950	and begat Arphaxad two years after the flood:
c951	And Shem lived
c952	after he begat Arphaxad
c953	five hundred years,
c954	and begat sons and daughters.
c955	And Arphaxad lived five and thirty years,
c956	and begat Salah:
c957	And Arphaxad lived
c958	after he begat Salah
c959	four hundred and three years,
c960	and begat sons and daughters.
c961	And Salah lived thirty years,
c962	and begat Eber:
c963	And Salah lived
c964	after he begat Eber
c965	four hundred and three years,
c966	and begat sons and daughters.
c967	And Eber lived four and thirty years,
c968	and begat Peleg:
c969	And Eber lived
c970	after he begat Peleg
c971	four hundred and thirty years,
c972	and begat sons and daughters.
c973	And Peleg lived thirty years,
c974	and begat Reu:
c975	And Peleg lived
c976	after he begat Reu
c977	two hundred and nine years,
c978	and begat sons and daughters.
c979	And Reu lived two and thirty years,
c980	and begat Serug:
c981	And Reu lived
c982	after he begat Serug
c983	two hundred and seven years,
c984	and begat sons and daughters.
c985	And Serug lived thirty years,
c986	and begat Nahor:
c987	And Serug lived
c988	after he begat Nahor
c989	two hundred years,
c990	and begat sons and daughters.
c991	And Nahor lived nine and twenty years,
c992	and begat Terah:
c993	And Nahor lived
c994	after he begat Terah
c995	an hundred and nineteen years,
c996	and begat sons and daughters.
c997	And Terah lived seventy years,
c998	and begat Abram, Nahor, and Haran.
c999	Now these <i>are</i> the generations of Terah:
c1000	Terah begat Abram, Nahor, and Haran;
c1001	and Haran begat Lot.
c1002	And Haran died before his father Terah in the land of his nativity, in Ur of the Chaldees.
c1003	And Abram and Nahor took them wives:
c1004	the name of Abram's wife <i>was</i> Sarai;
c1005	and the name of Nahor's wife, Milcah, the daughter of Haran, the father of Milcah, and the father of Iscah.
c1006	But Sarai was barren;
c1007	she <i>had</i> no child.
c1008	And Terah took Abram his son, and Lot the son of Haran his son's son, and Sarai his daughter in law, his son Abram's wife;
c1009	and they went forth with them from Ur of the Chaldees,
c1010	to go into the land of Canaan;
c1011	and they came unto Haran,
c1012	and dwelt there.
c1013	And the days of Terah were two hundred and five years:
c1014	and Terah died in Haran.
c1015	Now the LORD had said unto Abram,
c1016	Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father's house, unto a land
c1017	that I will shew thee:
c1018	And I will make of thee a great nation,
c1019	and I will bless
c1020	thee, and make thy name great;
c1021	and thou shalt be a blessing:
c1022	And I will bless them that bless
c1023	thee, and curse him that curseth
c1024	thee: and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed.
c1025	So Abram departed,
c1026	as the LORD had spoken unto
c1027	him; and Lot went with
c1028	him: and Abram <i>was</i> seventy and five years old
c1029	when he departed out of Haran.
c1030	And Abram took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother's son, and all their substance
c1031	that they had gathered,
c1032	and the souls
c1033	that they had gotten in Haran;
c1034	and they went forth
c1035	to go into the land of Canaan;
c1036	and into the land of Canaan they came.
c1037	And Abram passed through the land unto the place of Sichem, unto the plain of Moreh.
c1038	And the Canaanite <i>was</i> then in the land.
c1039	And the LORD appeared unto Abram,
c1040	and said,
c1041	Unto thy seed will I give this land:
c1042	and there builded he an altar unto the LORD,
c1043	who appeared unto him.
c1044	And he removed from thence unto a mountain on the east of Bethel,
c1045	and pitched his tent,
c1046	<i>having</i> Bethel on the west,
c1047	and Hai on the east:
c1048	and there he builded an altar unto the LORD,
c1049	and called upon the name of the LORD.
c1050	And Abram journeyed, going on still toward the south.
c1051	And there was a famine in the land:
c1052	and Abram went down into Egypt
c1053	to sojourn there;
c1054	for the famine <i>was</i> grievous in the land.
c1055	And it came to pass,
c1056	when he was come near
c1057	to enter into Egypt,
c1058	that he said unto Sarai his wife,
c1059	Behold now, I know
c1060	that thou <i>art</i> a fair woman to look upon:
c1061	Therefore it shall come to pass,
c1062	when the Egyptians shall see
c1063	thee, that they shall say,
c1064	This <i>is</i> his wife:
c1065	and they will kill
c1066	me, but they will save thee alive.
c1067	Say, I pray thee,
c1068	thou <i>art</i> my sister:
c1069	that it may be well with me for thy sake;
c1070	and my soul shall live because of thee.
c1071	And it came to pass,
c1072	that, when Abram was come into Egypt,
c1073	the Egyptians beheld the woman
c1074	that she <i>was</i> very fair.
c1075	The princes also of Pharaoh saw
c1076	her, and commended her before Pharaoh:
c1077	and the woman was taken into Pharaoh's house.
c1078	And he entreated Abram well for her sake:
c1079	and he had sheep, and oxen, and he asses, and menservants, and maidservants, and she asses, and camels.
c1080	And the LORD plagued Pharaoh and his house with great plagues because of Sarai Abram's wife.
c1081	And Pharaoh called Abram,
c1082	and said,
c1083	What <i>is</i> this <i>that</i> thou hast done
c1084	unto me? why didst thou not tell
c1085	me that she <i>was</i> thy wife?
c1086	Why saidst
c1087	thou, She <i>is</i> my sister?
c1088	so I might have taken her to me to wife:
c1089	now therefore behold thy wife,
c1090	take
c1091	<i>her,</i> and go thy way.
c1092	And Pharaoh commanded <i>his</i> men concerning
c1093	him: and they sent him away, and his wife, and all
c1094	that he had.
c1095	And Abram went up out of Egypt, he, and his wife, and all
c1096	that
c1097	he had, and Lot with
c1098	him, into the south.
c1099	And Abram <i>was</i> very rich in cattle, in silver, and in gold.
c1100	And he went on his journeys from the south even to Bethel, unto the place
c1101	where his tent had been at the beginning,
c1102	between Bethel and Hai;
c1103	Unto the place of the altar,
c1104	which he had made there at the first:
c1105	and there Abram called on the name of the LORD.
c1106	And Lot also,
c1107	which went with Abram,
c1108	had flocks, and herds, and tents.
c1109	And the land was not able to bear
c1110	them, that they might dwell together:
c1111	for their substance was great,
c1112	so that they could not
c1113	dwell together.
c1114	And there was a strife between the herdmen of Abram's cattle and the herdmen of Lot's cattle:
c1115	and the Canaanite and the Perizzite dwelled then in the land.
c1116	And Abram said unto Lot,
c1117	Let there be no strife, I pray thee, between me and thee, and between my herdmen and thy herdmen;
c1118	for we <i>be</i> brethren.
c1119	<i>Is</i> not the whole land before
c1120	thee? separate thyself, I pray thee, from
c1121	me: if <i>thou wilt take</i> the left hand,
c1122	then I will go to the right;
c1123	or if <i>thou depart</i> to the right hand,
c1124	then I will go to the left.
c1125	And Lot lifted up his eyes,
c1126	and beheld all the plain of Jordan,
c1127	that it <i>was</i> well watered every where,
c1128	before the LORD destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah,
c1129	<i>even</i> as the garden of the LORD, like the land of Egypt,
c1130	as thou comest unto Zoar.
c1131	Then Lot chose him all the plain of Jordan;
c1132	and Lot journeyed east:
c1133	and they separated themselves
c1134	the one from the other.
c1135	Abram dwelled in the land of Canaan,
c1136	and Lot dwelled in the cities of the plain,
c1137	and pitched <i>his</i> tent toward Sodom.
c1138	But the men of Sodom <i>were</i> wicked and sinners before the LORD exceedingly.
c1139	And the LORD said unto Abram,
c1140	after that Lot was separated from
c1141	him, Lift up now thine eyes,
c1142	and look from the place
c1143	where thou
c1144	art northward, and southward, and eastward, and westward:
c1145	For all the land
c1146	which thou seest,
c1147	to thee will I give
c1148	it, and to thy seed for ever.
c1149	And I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth:
c1150	so that
c1151	if a man can
c1152	number the dust of the earth,
c1153	<i>then</i> shall thy seed also be numbered.
c1154	Arise,
c1155	walk through the land in the length of it and in the breadth
c1156	of it; for I will give it unto thee.
c1157	Then Abram removed <i>his</i> tent,
c1158	and came
c1159	and dwelt in the plain of Mamre,
c1160	which <i>is</i> in Hebron,
c1161	and built there an altar unto the LORD.
c1162	And it came to pass in the days of Amraphel king of Shinar, Arioch king of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of nations;
c1163	<i>That these</i> made war with Bera king of Sodom, and with Birsha king of Gomorrah, Shinab king of Admah, and Shemeber king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela,
c1164	which is Zoar.
c1165	All these were joined together in the vale of Siddim,
c1166	which is the salt sea.
c1167	Twelve years they served Chedorlaomer,
c1168	and in the thirteenth year they rebelled.
c1169	And in the fourteenth year came Chedorlaomer, and the kings
c1170	that <i>were</i> with
c1171	him, and smote the Rephaims in Ashteroth Karnaim,
c1172	and the Zuzims in Ham,
c1173	and the Emims in Shaveh Kiriathaim,
c1174	And the Horites in their mount Seir, unto Elparan,
c1175	which <i>is</i> by the wilderness.
c1176	And they returned,
c1177	and came to Enmishpat,
c1178	which <i>is</i> Kadesh,
c1179	and smote all the country of the Amalekites, and also the Amorites,
c1180	that dwelt in Hazezontamar.
c1181	And there went out the king of Sodom, and the king of Gomorrah, and the king of Admah, and the king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela
c1182	(the same <i>is</i> Zoar;)
c1183	and they joined battle with them in the vale of Siddim;
c1184	With Chedorlaomer the king of Elam, and with Tidal king of nations, and Amraphel king of Shinar, and Arioch king of Ellasar;
c1185	four kings with five.
c1186	And the vale of Siddim <i>was full of</i> slimepits;
c1187	and the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled,
c1188	and fell there;
c1189	and they that remained fled to the mountain.
c1190	And they took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah, and all their victuals,
c1191	and went their way.
c1192	And they took Lot, Abram's brother's son, who dwelt in Sodom, and his goods,
c1193	and departed.
c1195	And there came one that had escaped,
c1196	and told Abram the Hebrew;
c1197	for he dwelt in the plain of Mamre the Amorite, brother of Eshcol, and brother of Aner:
c1198	and these <i>were</i> confederate with Abram.
c1199	And when Abram heard
c1200	that his brother was taken captive,
c1201	he armed his trained <i>servants,</i> born in his own house, three hundred and eighteen,
c1202	and pursued <i>them</i> unto Dan.
c1203	And he divided himself against them, he and his servants, by night,
c1204	and smote
c1205	them, and pursued them unto Hobah,
c1206	which <i>is</i> on the left hand of Damascus.
c1207	And he brought back all the goods,
c1208	and also brought again his brother Lot, and his goods, and the women also, and the people.
c1209	And the king of Sodom went out
c1210	to meet
c1211	him after his return
c1212	from the slaughter of Chedorlaomer, and of the kings
c1213	that <i>were</i> with
c1214	him, at the valley of Shaveh,
c1215	which <i>is</i> the king's dale.
c1216	And Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth bread and wine:
c1217	and he <i>was</i> the priest of the most high God.
c1218	And he blessed
c1219	him, and said,
c1220	Blessed <i>be</i> Abram of the most high God, possessor of heaven and earth:
c1221	And blessed be the most high God,
c1222	which hath delivered thine enemies into thy hand.
c1223	And he gave him tithes of all.
c1224	And the king of Sodom said unto Abram,
c1225	Give me the persons,
c1226	and take the goods to thyself.
c1227	And Abram said to the king of Sodom,
c1228	I have lift up mine hand unto the LORD, the most high God, the possessor of heaven and earth,
c1229	That I will not <i>take</i> from a thread even to a shoelatchet,
c1230	and that I will not take any thing
c1231	that
c1232	<i>is</i> thine, lest thou shouldest say,
c1233	I have made Abram rich:
c1234	Save
c1235	only
c1236	that which the young men have eaten,
c1237	and the portion of the men
c1238	which went with
c1239	me, Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre;
c1240	let them take their portion.
c1241	After these things the word of the LORD came unto Abram in a vision,
c1242	saying,
c1243	Fear not,
c1244	Abram:
c1245	I <i>am</i> thy shield,
c1246	<i>and</i> thy exceeding great reward.
c1247	And Abram said,
c1248	Lord GOD,
c1249	what wilt thou give
c1250	me, seeing I go childless,
c1251	and the steward of my house
c1252	<i>is</i> this Eliezer of Damascus?
c1253	And Abram said,
c1254	Behold, to me thou hast given no seed:
c1255	and, lo, one born in my house is mine heir.
c1256	And, behold, the word of the LORD <i>came</i> unto
c1257	him, saying,
c1258	This shall not be thine heir;
c1259	but
c1260	he that shall come forth out of thine own bowels
c1261	shall be thine heir.
c1262	And he brought him forth abroad,
c1263	and said,
c1264	Look now toward heaven,
c1265	and tell the stars,
c1266	if thou be able
c1267	to number
c1268	them: and he said
c1269	unto him, So shall thy seed be.
c1270	And he believed in the LORD;
c1271	and he counted it to him for righteousness.
c1272	And he said unto
c1273	him, I <i>am</i> the LORD
c1274	that brought thee out of Ur of the Chaldees,
c1275	to give thee this land
c1276	to inherit it.
c1277	And he said,
c1278	Lord GOD,
c1279	whereby shall I know
c1280	that I shall inherit it?
c1281	And he said unto
c1282	him, Take me an heifer of three years old, and a she goat of three years old, and a ram of three years old, and a turtledove, and a young pigeon.
c1283	And he took unto him all these,
c1284	and divided them in the midst,
c1285	and laid each piece
c1286	one against another:
c1287	but the birds divided he not.
c1288	And when the fowls came down upon the carcases,
c1289	Abram drove them away.
c1290	And when the sun
c1291	was going down,
c1292	a deep sleep fell upon Abram;
c1293	and, lo, an horror of great darkness fell upon him.
c1294	And he said unto Abram,
c1295	Know of a surety
c1296	that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land
c1297	<i>that is</i> not
c1298	theirs, and shall serve
c1299	them; and they shall afflict them four hundred years;
c1300	And also that nation,
c1301	whom they shall serve,
c1302	will I judge:
c1303	and afterward shall they come out with great substance.
c1304	And thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace;
c1305	thou shalt be buried in a good old age.
c1306	But in the fourth generation they shall come hither again:
c1307	for the iniquity of the Amorites <i>is</i> not yet full.
c1308	And it came to pass,
c1309	that, when the sun went down,
c1310	and it was dark,
c1311	behold a smoking furnace, and a burning lamp
c1312	that passed between those pieces.
c1313	In the same day the LORD made a covenant with Abram,
c1314	saying,
c1315	Unto thy seed have I given this land, from the river of Egypt unto the great river, the river Euphrates:
c1316	The Kenites, and the Kenizzites, and the Kadmonites,
c1317	And the Hittites, and the Perizzites, and the Rephaims,
c1318	And the Amorites, and the Canaanites, and the Girgashites, and the Jebusites.
c1319	Now Sarai Abram's wife bare him no children:
c1320	and she had an handmaid, an Egyptian,
c1321	whose name <i>was</i> Hagar.
c1322	And Sarai said unto Abram,
c1323	Behold now, the LORD hath restrained
c1324	me from bearing:
c1325	I pray thee, go in unto my maid;
c1326	it may be that I may obtain children by
c1327	her. And Abram hearkened to the voice of Sarai.
c1328	And Sarai Abram's wife took Hagar her maid the Egyptian, after Abram had dwelt ten years
c1329	in the land of Canaan,
c1330	and gave her to her husband Abram to be his wife.
c1331	And he went in unto Hagar,
c1332	and she conceived:
c1333	and when she saw
c1334	that she had conceived,
c1335	her mistress was despised in her eyes.
c1336	And Sarai said unto Abram,
c1337	My wrong <i>be</i> upon
c1338	thee: I have given my maid into thy bosom;
c1339	and when she saw
c1340	that she had conceived,
c1341	I was despised in her eyes:
c1342	the LORD judge between me and thee.
c1343	But Abram said unto Sarai,
c1344	Behold, thy maid <i>is</i> in thy hand;
c1345	do
c1346	to her as it pleaseth
c1347	thee. And when Sarai dealt hardly
c1348	with her, she fled from her face.
c1349	And the angel of the LORD found her by a fountain of water in the wilderness, by the fountain in the way to Shur.
c1350	And he said,
c1351	Hagar, Sarai's maid,
c1352	whence camest
c1353	thou? and whither wilt thou go?
c1354	And she said,
c1355	I flee from the face of my mistress Sarai.
c1356	And the angel of the LORD said
c1357	unto her, Return to thy mistress,
c1358	and submit thyself under her hands.
c1359	And the angel of the LORD said
c1360	unto her, I will multiply thy seed exceedingly,
c1361	that it shall not be numbered for multitude.
c1362	And the angel of the LORD said
c1363	unto her, Behold, thou <i>art</i> with child,
c1364	and shalt bear a son,
c1365	and shalt call his name Ishmael;
c1366	because the LORD hath heard thy affliction.
c1367	And he will be a wild man;
c1368	his hand <i>will be</i> against every man,
c1369	and every man's hand
c1370	against him; and he shall dwell in the presence of all his brethren.
c1371	And she called the name of the LORD
c1372	that spake unto
c1373	her, Thou God seest
c1374	me: for she said,
c1375	Have I also here looked
c1376	after him that seeth me?
c1377	Wherefore the well was called Beerlahairoi;
c1378	behold, <i>it is</i> between Kadesh and Bered.
c1379	And Hagar bare Abram a son:
c1380	and Abram called his son's name,
c1381	which Hagar bare,
c1382	Ishmael.
c1383	And Abram <i>was</i> fourscore and six years old,
c1384	when Hagar bare Ishmael to Abram.
c1385	And when Abram was ninety years old and nine,
c1386	the LORD appeared to Abram,
c1387	and said unto
c1388	him, I <i>am</i> the Almighty God;
c1389	walk before
c1390	me, and be thou perfect.
c1391	And I will make my covenant between
c1392	me and thee, and will multiply thee exceedingly.
c1393	And Abram fell on his face:
c1394	and God talked with
c1395	him, saying,
c1396	As for me,
c1397	behold, my covenant <i>is</i> with
c1398	thee, and thou shalt be a father of many nations.
c1399	Neither shall thy name any more be called Abram,
c1400	but thy name shall be Abraham;
c1401	for a father of many nations have I made thee.
c1402	And I will make thee exceeding fruitful,
c1403	and I will make nations
c1404	of thee, and kings shall come out of thee.
c1405	And I will establish my covenant between me and thee and thy seed after thee in their generations for an everlasting covenant,
c1406	to be a God unto thee, and to thy seed after thee.
c1407	And I will give unto thee, and to thy seed after thee, the land wherein thou art a stranger, all the land of Canaan, for an everlasting possession;
c1408	and I will be their God.
c1409	And God said unto Abraham,
c1410	Thou
c1411	shalt keep my covenant therefore, thou, and thy seed after thee in their generations.
c1412	This <i>is</i> my covenant,
c1413	which ye shall keep,
c1414	between me and you and thy seed after
c1415	thee; Every man child among you shall be circumcised.
c1416	And ye shall circumcise the flesh of your foreskin;
c1417	and it shall be a token of the covenant betwixt me and you.
c1418	And he that is eight days old shall be circumcised among you, every man child in your generations, he that is born in the house, or bought with money of any stranger,
c1419	which <i>is</i> not of thy seed.
c1420	He that is born in thy house, and he that is bought with thy money, must needs be circumcised:
c1421	and my covenant shall be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant.
c1422	And the uncircumcised man child
c1423	whose flesh of his foreskin is not circumcised,
c1424	that soul shall be cut off from his people;
c1425	he hath broken my covenant.
c1426	And God said unto Abraham,
c1427	As for Sarai thy wife,
c1428	thou shalt not call her name Sarai,
c1429	but Sarah <i>shall</i> her name <i>be.</i>
c1430	And I will bless
c1431	her, and give thee a son also of
c1432	her: yea, I will bless
c1433	her, and she shall be <i>a mother</i> of nations;
c1434	kings of people shall be of her.
c1435	Then Abraham fell upon his face,
c1436	and laughed,
c1437	and said in his heart,
c1438	Shall <i>a child</i> be born unto him that is an hundred years old?
c1439	and shall Sarah,
c1440	that is ninety years old, bear?
c1441	And Abraham said unto God,
c1442	O that Ishmael might live before thee!
c1443	And God said,
c1444	Sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son indeed;
c1445	and thou shalt call his name Isaac:
c1446	and I will establish my covenant with him for an everlasting covenant, <i>and</i> with his seed after him.
c1447	And as for Ishmael, I have heard
c1448	thee: Behold, I have blessed
c1449	him, and will make him fruitful,
c1450	and will multiply him exceedingly;
c1451	twelve princes shall he beget,
c1452	and I will make him a great nation.
c1453	But my covenant will I establish with Isaac,
c1454	which Sarah shall bear unto thee at this set time in the next year.
c1455	And he left off
c1456	talking with
c1457	him, and God went up from Abraham.
c1458	And Abraham took Ishmael his son, and all that were born in his house, and all that were bought with his money, every male among the men of Abraham's house;
c1459	and circumcised the flesh of their foreskin in the selfsame day,
c1460	as God had said unto him.
c1461	And Abraham <i>was</i> ninety years old and nine,
c1462	when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin.
c1463	And Ishmael his son <i>was</i> thirteen years old,
c1464	when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin.
c1465	In the selfsame day was Abraham circumcised, and Ishmael his son.
c1466	And all the men of his house, born in the house, and bought with money of the stranger, were circumcised with him.
c1467	And the LORD appeared unto him in the plains of Mamre:
c1468	and he sat in the tent door
c1469	in the heat of the day;
c1470	And he lift up his eyes
c1471	and looked,
c1472	and, lo, three men stood by
c1473	him: and when he saw
c1474	<i>them,</i> he ran
c1475	to meet
c1476	them from the tent door,
c1477	and bowed himself toward the ground,
c1478	And said,
c1479	My Lord,
c1480	if now I have found favour in thy sight,
c1481	pass not away, I pray thee, from thy servant:
c1482	Let a little water, I pray you, be fetched,
c1483	and wash your feet,
c1484	and rest yourselves under the tree:
c1485	And I will fetch a morsel of bread,
c1486	and comfort ye your hearts;
c1487	after that ye shall pass on:
c1488	for therefore are ye come to your servant.
c1489	And they said,
c1490	So do,
c1491	as thou hast said.
c1492	And Abraham hastened into the tent unto Sarah,
c1493	and said,
c1494	Make ready quickly
c1495	three measures of fine meal, knead
c1496	<i>it,</i> and make cakes upon the hearth.
c1497	And Abraham ran unto the herd,
c1498	and fetcht a calf tender and good,
c1499	and gave <i>it</i> unto a young man;
c1500	and he hasted
c1501	to dress it.
c1502	And he took butter, and milk, and the calf
c1503	which he had dressed,
c1504	and set <i>it</i> before
c1505	them; and he stood by them under the tree,
c1506	and they did eat.
c1507	And they said unto
c1508	him, Where <i>is</i> Sarah thy wife?
c1509	And he said,
c1510	Behold, in the tent.
c1511	And he said,
c1512	I will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life;
c1513	and, lo, Sarah thy wife shall have a son.
c1514	And Sarah heard <i>it</i> in the tent door,
c1515	which <i>was</i> behind him.
c1516	Now Abraham and Sarah <i>were</i> old
c1517	<i>and</i> well stricken in age;
c1518	<i>and</i> it ceased
c1519	to be with Sarah
c1520	after the manner of women.
c1521	Therefore Sarah laughed within
c1522	herself, saying,
c1523	After I am waxed old
c1524	shall I have pleasure,
c1525	my lord being old also?
c1526	And the LORD said unto Abraham,
c1527	Wherefore did Sarah laugh,
c1528	saying,
c1529	Shall I of a surety bear a child,
c1530	which am old?
c1531	Is any thing too hard for the LORD?
c1532	At the time appointed I will return unto thee, according to the time of life,
c1533	and Sarah shall have a son.
c1534	Then Sarah denied,
c1535	saying,
c1536	I laughed not;
c1537	for she was afraid.
c1538	And he said,
c1539	Nay;
c1540	but thou didst laugh.
c1541	And the men rose up from thence,
c1542	and looked toward Sodom:
c1543	and Abraham went with
c1544	them to bring them on the way.
c1545	And the LORD said,
c1546	Shall I hide from Abraham
c1547	that thing which I do;
c1548	Seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation,
c1549	and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him?
c1550	For I know
c1551	him, that he will command his children and his household after
c1552	him, and they shall keep the way of the LORD,
c1553	to do justice and judgment;
c1554	that the LORD may bring upon Abraham
c1555	that which he hath spoken of him.
c1556	And the LORD said,
c1558	Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great,
c1560	and because their sin is very grievous;
c1561	I will go down now,
c1562	and see
c1563	according to the cry
c1564	of it, which is come unto
c1565	whether they have done altogether
c1566	me; and if not,
c1567	I will know.
c1568	And the men turned their faces from thence,
c1569	and went toward Sodom:
c1570	but Abraham
c1571	stood yet before the LORD.
c1572	And Abraham drew near,
c1573	and said,
c1574	Wilt thou also destroy the righteous with the wicked?
c1575	Peradventure there be fifty righteous within the city:
c1576	wilt thou also destroy
c1577	and not spare the place for the fifty righteous
c1578	that <i>are</i> therein?
c1579	That be far
c1580	from thee to do after this manner,
c1581	to slay the righteous with the wicked:
c1582	and that the righteous should be as the wicked,
c1583	that be far
c1584	from thee: Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?
c1585	And the LORD said,
c1586	If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within the city,
c1587	then I will spare all the place for their sakes.
c1588	And Abraham answered
c1589	and said,
c1590	Behold now, I have taken upon
c1591	me to speak unto the Lord,
c1592	which <i>am but</i> dust and ashes:
c1593	Peradventure there shall lack five of the fifty righteous:
c1594	wilt thou destroy all the city for <i>lack of</i> five?
c1595	And he said,
c1596	I will not destroy <i>it.</i>
c1597	If I find there forty and five,
c1598	him yet again,
c1599	And he spake unto
c1600	and said,
c1601	Peradventure there shall be forty found there.
c1602	And he said,
c1603	I will not do <i>it</i> for forty's sake.
c1604	And he said
c1605	<i>unto him,</i> Oh let not the Lord be angry,
c1606	and I will speak:
c1607	Peradventure there shall thirty be found there.
c1608	And he said,
c1609	I will not do
c1610	<i>it,</i> if I find thirty there.
c1611	And he said,
c1612	Behold now, I have taken upon
c1613	me to speak unto the Lord:
c1614	Peradventure there shall be twenty found there.
c1615	And he said,
c1616	I will not destroy <i>it</i> for twenty's sake.
c1617	And he said,
c1618	Oh let not the Lord be angry,
c1619	and I will speak yet but this once:
c1620	Peradventure ten shall be found there.
c1621	And he said,
c1622	I will not destroy <i>it</i> for ten's sake.
c1623	And the LORD went his way,
c1624	as soon as he had left
c1625	communing with Abraham:
c1626	and Abraham returned unto his place.
c1627	And there came two angels to Sodom at even;
c1628	and Lot sat in the gate of Sodom:
c1629	and Lot seeing
c1630	<i>them</i> rose up
c1631	to meet
c1632	them; and he bowed himself
c1633	with his face toward the ground;
c1634	And he said,
c1635	Behold now,
c1636	my lords,
c1637	turn in, I pray you, into your servant's house,
c1638	and tarry all night,
c1639	and wash your feet,
c1640	and ye shall rise up early,
c1641	and go on your ways.
c1642	And they said,
c1643	Nay;
c1644	but we will abide in the street all night.
c1645	And he pressed upon them greatly;
c1646	and they turned in unto
c1647	him, and entered into his house;
c1648	and he made them a feast,
c1649	and did bake unleavened bread,
c1650	and they did eat.
c1651	But before they lay down,
c1652	the men of the city, <i>even</i> the men of Sodom, compassed the house round, both old and young, all the people from every quarter:
c1653	And they called unto Lot,
c1654	and said
c1655	unto him, Where <i>are</i> the men
c1656	which came in to thee this night?
c1657	bring them out unto
c1658	us, that we may know them.
c1659	And Lot went out at the door unto
c1660	them, and shut the door after him,
c1661	And said,
c1662	I pray you,
c1663	brethren,
c1664	do not so wickedly.
c1665	Behold now, I have two daughters
c1666	which have not known man;
c1667	let me, I pray you, bring them out unto
c1668	you, and do ye to them as <i>is</i> good in your eyes:
c1669	only unto these men do nothing;
c1670	for therefore came they under the shadow of my roof.
c1671	And they said,
c1672	Stand back.
c1673	And they said
c1674	<i>again,</i> This one <i>fellow</i> came in
c1675	to sojourn,
c1676	and he will needs be a judge:
c1677	now will we deal worse with thee, than
c1678	with them. And they pressed sore upon the man, <i>even</i> Lot,
c1679	and came near
c1680	to break the door.
c1681	But the men put forth their hand,
c1682	and pulled Lot into the house to
c1683	them, and shut to the door.
c1685	that <i>were</i> at the door of the house with blindness, both small and great:
c1686	And they smote the men
c1687	so that they wearied themselves
c1688	to find the door.
c1689	And the men said unto Lot,
c1690	Hast thou here any besides?
c1691	son in law, and thy sons, and thy daughters, and whatsoever
c1692	thou hast in the city,
c1693	bring <i>them</i> out of this place:
c1694	For we will destroy this place,
c1695	because the cry of them is waxen great before the face of the LORD;
c1696	and the LORD hath sent
c1697	us to destroy it.
c1698	And Lot went out,
c1699	and spake unto his sons in law, which married his daughters,
c1700	and said,
c1701	Up,
c1702	get you out of this place;
c1703	for the LORD will destroy this city.
c1704	But he seemed as one that mocked unto his sons in law.
c1705	And when the morning arose,
c1706	then the angels hastened Lot,
c1707	saying,
c1708	Arise,
c1709	take thy wife, and thy two daughters,
c1710	which are here;
c1711	lest thou be consumed in the iniquity of the city.
c1712	And while he lingered,
c1713	the men laid hold upon his hand, and upon the hand of his wife, and upon the hand of his two daughters; the LORD being merciful unto
c1714	him: and they brought him forth,
c1715	and set him without the city.
c1716	And it came to pass,
c1717	when they had brought them forth abroad,
c1718	that he said,
c1719	Escape for thy life;
c1720	look not behind
c1721	thee, neither stay thou in all the plain;
c1722	escape to the mountain,
c1723	lest thou be consumed.
c1724	And Lot said unto
c1725	them, Oh, not
c1726	so, my Lord:
c1727	Behold now, thy servant hath found grace in thy sight,
c1728	and thou hast magnified thy mercy,
c1729	which thou hast shewed unto
c1730	me in saving my life;
c1731	and I cannot
c1732	escape to the mountain,
c1733	lest some evil take
c1734	me, and I die:
c1735	Behold now, this city <i>is</i> near
c1736	to flee unto,
c1737	and it <i>is</i> a little one:
c1738	Oh, let me escape thither,
c1739	<i>(is</i> it not a little one?)
c1740	and my soul shall live.
c1741	And he said unto
c1742	him, See, I have accepted thee concerning this thing also,
c1743	that I will not overthrow this city,
c1744	for the which thou hast spoken.
c1745	Haste
c1746	thee, escape thither;
c1747	for I cannot
c1748	do any thing
c1749	till thou be come thither.
c1750	Therefore the name of the city was called Zoar.
c1751	The sun was risen upon the earth
c1752	when Lot entered into Zoar.
c1753	Then the LORD rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone and fire from the LORD out of heaven;
c1754	And he overthrew those cities, and all the plain, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew upon the ground.
c1755	But his wife looked back from behind
c1756	him, and she became a pillar of salt.
c1757	And Abraham gat up early in the morning to the place
c1758	where he stood before the LORD:
c1759	And he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah, and toward all the land of the plain,
c1760	and beheld,
c1761	and, lo, the smoke of the country went up as the smoke of a furnace.
c1762	And it came to pass,
c1763	when God destroyed the cities of the plain,
c1764	that God remembered Abraham,
c1765	and sent Lot out of the midst of the overthrow,
c1766	when he overthrew the cities
c1767	in the which Lot dwelt.
c1768	And Lot went up out of Zoar,
c1769	and dwelt in the mountain,
c1770	and his two daughters with
c1771	him; for he feared
c1772	to dwell in Zoar:
c1773	and he dwelt in a cave, he and his two daughters.
c1774	And the firstborn said unto the younger,
c1775	Our father <i>is</i> old,
c1776	and <i>there is</i> not a man in the earth
c1777	to come in unto us after the manner of all the earth:
c1778	Come,
c1779	let us make our father drink wine,
c1780	and we will lie with
c1781	him, that we may preserve seed of our father.
c1782	And they made their father drink wine that night:
c1783	and the firstborn went in,
c1784	and lay with her father;
c1785	and he perceived not
c1786	when she lay down,
c1787	nor when she arose.
c1788	And it came to pass on the morrow,
c1789	that the firstborn said unto the younger,
c1790	Behold, I lay yesternight with my father:
c1791	let us make him drink wine this night also;
c1792	and go thou in,
c1793	<i>and</i> lie with
c1794	him, that we may preserve seed of our father.
c1795	And they made their father drink wine that night also:
c1796	and the younger arose,
c1797	and lay with
c1798	him; and he perceived not
c1799	when she lay down,
c1800	nor when she arose.
c1801	Thus were both the daughters of Lot with child by their father.
c1802	And the firstborn bare a son,
c1803	and called his name Moab:
c1804	the same <i>is</i> the father of the Moabites unto this day.
c1805	And the younger, she also bare a son,
c1806	and called his name Benammi:
c1807	the same <i>is</i> the father of the children of Ammon unto this day.
c1808	And Abraham journeyed from thence toward the south country,
c1809	and dwelled between Kadesh and Shur,
c1810	and sojourned in Gerar.
c1811	And Abraham said of Sarah his wife,
c1812	She <i>is</i> my sister:
c1813	and Abimelech king of Gerar sent,
c1814	and took Sarah.
c1815	But God came to Abimelech in a dream by night,
c1816	and said
c1817	to him, Behold, thou <i>art but</i> a dead man, for the woman
c1818	which thou hast taken;
c1819	for she <i>is</i> a man's wife.
c1820	But Abimelech had not come near
c1821	her: and he said,
c1822	Lord,
c1823	wilt thou slay also a righteous nation?
c1824	Said he not
c1825	unto me, She <i>is</i> my sister?
c1826	and she, even she herself said,
c1827	He <i>is</i> my brother:
c1828	in the integrity of my heart and innocency of my hands have I done this.
c1829	And God said unto him in a dream,
c1830	Yea, I know
c1831	that thou didst this in the integrity of thy heart;
c1832	for I also withheld
c1833	thee from sinning
c1834	against me: therefore suffered I thee not
c1835	to touch her.
c1836	Now
c1837	therefore restore the man <i>his</i> wife;
c1838	for he <i>is</i> a prophet,
c1839	and he shall pray for
c1840	thee, and thou shalt live:
c1841	and if thou restore <i>her</i> not,
c1842	know
c1843	thou that thou shalt surely die, thou, and all
c1844	that <i>are</i> thine.
c1845	Therefore Abimelech rose early in the morning,
c1846	and called all his servants,
c1847	and told all these things in their ears:
c1848	and the men were sore afraid.
c1849	Then Abimelech called Abraham,
c1850	and said
c1851	unto him, What hast thou done
c1852	unto us? and what have I offended
c1853	thee, that thou hast brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin?
c1855	thou hast done deeds
c1856	unto me that ought not to be done.
c1857	And Abimelech said unto Abraham,
c1858	What sawest
c1859	thou, that thou hast done this thing?
c1860	And Abraham said,
c1861	Because I thought,
c1862	Surely the fear of God <i>is</i> not in this place;
c1863	and they will slay me for my wife's sake.
c1864	And yet indeed <i>she is</i> my sister; she <i>is</i> the daughter of my father,
c1865	but not the daughter of my mother;
c1866	and she became my wife.
c1867	And it came to pass,
c1868	when God caused me to wander from my father's house,
c1869	that I said
c1870	unto her, This <i>is</i> thy kindness
c1871	which thou shalt shew unto
c1872	me; at every place
c1873	whither we shall come,
c1874	say
c1875	of me, He <i>is</i> my brother.
c1876	And Abimelech took sheep, and oxen, and menservants, and womenservants,
c1877	and gave <i>them</i> unto Abraham,
c1878	and restored him Sarah his wife.
c1879	And Abimelech said,
c1880	Behold, my land <i>is</i> before
c1881	thee: dwell where it pleaseth thee.
c1882	And unto Sarah he said,
c1883	Behold, I have given thy brother a thousand <i>pieces</i> of silver:
c1884	behold, he <i>is</i> to thee a covering of the eyes, unto all
c1885	that <i>are</i> with
c1886	thee, and with all
c1887	<i>other:</i> thus she was reproved.
c1888	So Abraham prayed unto God:
c1889	and God healed Abimelech, and his wife, and his maidservants;
c1890	and they bare <i>children.</i>
c1891	For the LORD had fast closed up all the wombs of the house of Abimelech, because of Sarah Abraham's wife.
c1892	And the LORD visited Sarah
c1893	as he had said,
c1894	and the LORD did unto Sarah
c1895	as he had spoken.
c1897	For Sarah conceived, and bare Abraham a son in his old age, at the set time
c1898	of which God had spoken to him.
c1899	And Abraham called the name of his son
c1900	that was born
c1901	unto him, whom Sarah bare
c1902	to him, Isaac.
c1903	And Abraham circumcised his son Isaac being eight days old,
c1904	as God had commanded him.
c1905	And Abraham was an hundred years old,
c1906	when his son Isaac was born unto him.
c1907	And Sarah said,
c1908	God hath made me to laugh,
c1909	<i>so that</i> all
c1910	that hear
c1911	will laugh with me.
c1912	And she said,
c1913	Who would have said unto Abraham,
c1914	that Sarah should have given children suck?
c1915	for I have born <i>him</i> a son in his old age.
c1916	And the child grew,
c1917	and was weaned:
c1918	and Abraham made a great feast the <i>same</i> day
c1919	that Isaac was weaned.
c1920	And Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian,
c1921	which she had born unto Abraham,
c1922	mocking.
c1923	Wherefore she said unto Abraham,
c1924	Cast out this bondwoman and her son:
c1925	for the son of this bondwoman shall not be heir with my son, <i>even</i> with Isaac.
c1926	And the thing was very grievous in Abraham's sight because of his son.
c1927	And God said unto Abraham,
c1928	Let it not be grievous in thy sight because of the lad, and because of thy bondwoman;
c1929	in all
c1930	that Sarah hath said unto
c1931	thee, hearken unto her voice;
c1932	for in Isaac shall thy seed be called.
c1933	And also of the son of the bondwoman
c1934	will I make a nation,
c1935	because he <i>is</i> thy seed.
c1936	And Abraham rose up early in the morning,
c1937	and took bread, and a bottle of water,
c1938	and gave <i>it</i> unto Hagar,
c1939	putting <i>it</i> on her shoulder,
c1940	and the child,
c1941	and sent her away:
c1942	and she departed,
c1943	and wandered in the wilderness of Beersheba.
c1944	And the water was spent in the bottle,
c1945	and she cast the child under one of the shrubs.
c1946	And she went,
c1947	and sat her down over against <i>him</i> a good way off, as it were a bowshot:
c1948	for she said,
c1949	Let me not see the death of the child.
c1950	And she sat over against
c1951	<i>him,</i> and lift up her voice,
c1952	and wept.
c1953	And God heard the voice of the lad;
c1954	and the angel of God called to Hagar out of heaven,
c1955	and said
c1956	unto her, What
c1957	aileth thee, Hagar?
c1958	fear not;
c1959	for God hath heard the voice of the lad
c1960	where he <i>is.</i>
c1961	Arise,
c1962	lift up the lad,
c1963	and hold him in thine hand;
c1964	for I will make him a great nation.
c1965	And God opened her eyes,
c1966	and she saw a well of water;
c1967	and she went,
c1968	and filled the bottle with water,
c1969	and gave the lad drink.
c1970	And God was with the lad;
c1971	and he grew,
c1972	and dwelt in the wilderness,
c1973	and became an archer.
c1974	And he dwelt in the wilderness of Paran:
c1975	and his mother took him a wife out of the land of Egypt.
c1976	And it came to pass at that time,
c1977	that Abimelech and Phichol the chief captain of his host spake unto Abraham,
c1978	saying,
c1979	God <i>is</i> with thee in all
c1980	that thou doest:
c1981	Now
c1982	therefore swear unto me here by God
c1983	that thou wilt not deal falsely with me, nor with my son, nor with my son's son:
c1984	<i>but</i> according to the kindness
c1985	that I have done unto
c1986	thee, thou shalt do unto me, and to the land
c1987	wherein thou hast sojourned.
c1988	And Abraham said,
c1989	I will swear.
c1990	And Abraham reproved Abimelech because of a well of water,
c1991	which Abimelech's servants had violently taken away.
c1992	And Abimelech said,
c1993	I wot not
c1994	who hath done this thing:
c1995	neither didst thou tell me, neither yet
c1996	heard I <i>of it,</i> but to day.
c1997	And Abraham took sheep and oxen,
c1998	and gave them unto Abimelech;
c1999	and both of them made a covenant.
c2000	And Abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock by themselves.
c2001	And Abimelech said unto Abraham,
c2002	What <i>mean</i> these seven ewe lambs
c2003	which thou hast set by themselves?
c2004	And he said,
c2005	For <i>these</i> seven ewe lambs shalt thou take of my hand,
c2006	that they may be a witness
c2007	unto me, that I have digged this well.
c2008	Wherefore he called that place Beersheba;
c2009	because there they sware both of them.
c2010	Thus they made a covenant at Beersheba:
c2011	then Abimelech rose up, and Phichol the chief captain of his host,
c2012	and they returned into the land of the Philistines.
c2013	And <i>Abraham</i> planted a grove in Beersheba,
c2014	and called there on the name of the LORD, the everlasting God.
c2015	And Abraham sojourned in the Philistines' land many days.
c2016	And it came to pass after these things,
c2017	that God did tempt Abraham,
c2018	and said unto
c2019	him, Abraham:
c2020	and he said,
c2021	Behold, <i>here</i> I <i>am.</i>
c2022	And he said,
c2023	Take now thy son, thine only
c2024	whom thou lovest,
c2025	<i>son</i> Isaac,
c2026	and get thee into the land of Moriah;
c2027	and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains
c2028	which I will tell thee of.
c2029	And Abraham rose up early in the morning,
c2030	and saddled his ass,
c2031	and took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son,
c2032	and clave the wood for the burnt offering,
c2033	and rose up,
c2034	and went unto the place
c2035	of which God had told him.
c2036	Then on the third day
c2037	Abraham lifted up his eyes,
c2038	and saw the place afar off.
c2039	And Abraham said unto his young men,
c2040	Abide ye here with the ass;
c2041	and I and the lad will go yonder
c2042	and worship,
c2043	and come again to you.
c2044	And Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering,
c2045	and laid <i>it</i> upon Isaac his son;
c2046	and he took the fire in his hand, and a knife;
c2047	and they went both of them together.
c2048	And Isaac spake unto Abraham his father,
c2049	and said,
c2050	My father:
c2051	and he said,
c2052	Here
c2053	<i>am</i> I, my son.
c2054	And he said,
c2055	Behold the fire and the wood:
c2056	but where <i>is</i> the lamb for a burnt offering?
c2057	And Abraham said,
c2058	God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering:
c2059	My son,
c2060	so they went both of them together.
c2061	And they came to the place
c2062	which God had told
c2063	him of; and Abraham built an altar there,
c2064	and laid the wood in order,
c2065	and bound Isaac his son,
c2066	and laid him on the altar upon the wood.
c2067	And Abraham stretched forth his hand,
c2068	and took the knife
c2069	to slay his son.
c2070	And the angel of the LORD called unto him out of heaven,
c2071	and said,
c2072	Abraham, Abraham:
c2073	and he said,
c2074	Here <i>am</i> I.
c2075	And he said,
c2076	Lay not thine hand upon the lad,
c2077	neither do thou any thing
c2078	unto him: for now I know
c2079	that thou fearest God,
c2080	seeing thou hast not withheld thy son, thine only <i>son</i> from me.
c2081	And Abraham lifted up his eyes,
c2082	and looked,
c2083	and behold behind <i>him</i> a ram
c2084	caught in a thicket by his horns:
c2085	and Abraham went
c2086	and took the ram,
c2087	and offered him up for a burnt offering in the stead of his son.
c2088	And Abraham called the name of that place
c2089	of the LORD it shall be seen.
c2091	Jehovahjireh: as it is said <i>to</i> this day, In the mount
c2092	And the angel of the LORD called unto Abraham out of heaven the second time,
c2093	And said,
c2094	By myself have I sworn,
c2095	saith the LORD,
c2096	for
c2097	because thou hast done this thing,
c2098	and hast not withheld thy son, thine only <i>son:</i>
c2099	That in blessing I will bless
c2100	thee, and in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven, and as the sand
c2101	which <i>is</i> upon the sea shore;
c2102	and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies;
c2103	And in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed;
c2104	because thou hast obeyed my voice.
c2105	So Abraham returned unto his young men,
c2106	and they rose up
c2107	and went together to Beersheba;
c2108	and Abraham dwelt at Beersheba.
c2109	And it came to pass after these things,
c2110	that it was told Abraham,
c2111	saying,
c2112	Behold, Milcah, she hath also born children unto thy brother Nahor;
c2113	Huz his firstborn, and Buz his brother, and Kemuel the father of Aram,
c2114	And Chesed, and Hazo, and Pildash, and Jidlaph, and Bethuel.
c2115	And Bethuel begat Rebekah:
c2116	these eight Milcah did bear to Nahor, Abraham's brother.
c2117	And his concubine,
c2118	whose name <i>was</i> Reumah,
c2119	she bare also Tebah, and Gaham, and Thahash, and Maachah.
c2120	And Sarah was an hundred and seven and twenty years old: <i>these were</i> the years
c2121	of the life of Sarah.
c2122	And Sarah died in Kirjatharba;
c2123	the same <i>is</i> Hebron
c2124	in the land of Canaan:
c2125	and Abraham came
c2126	to mourn for Sarah,
c2127	and to weep for her.
c2128	And Abraham stood up from before his dead,
c2129	and spake unto the sons of Heth,
c2130	saying,
c2131	I <i>am</i> a stranger and a sojourner with
c2132	you: give me a possession of a buryingplace with
c2133	you, that I may bury my dead out of my sight.
c2134	And the children of Heth answered Abraham,
c2135	saying unto him,
c2136	Hear
c2137	us, my lord:
c2138	thou <i>art</i> a mighty prince among
c2139	us: in the choice of our sepulchres bury thy dead;
c2140	none of
c2141	us shall withhold from thee his sepulchre,
c2142	but that thou mayest bury thy dead.
c2143	And Abraham stood up,
c2144	and bowed himself to the people of the land, <i>even</i> to the children of Heth.
c2145	And he communed with
c2146	them, saying,
c2147	If it be your mind
c2148	that I should bury my dead out of my sight;
c2149	hear
c2150	me, and intreat for me to Ephron the son of Zohar,
c2151	That he may give me the cave of Machpelah,
c2152	which
c2153	he hath, which <i>is</i> in the end of his field;
c2154	for as much money as it is worth he shall give it me for a possession of a buryingplace amongst you.
c2155	And Ephron dwelt among the children of Heth:
c2156	and Ephron the Hittite answered Abraham in the audience of the children of Heth, <i>even</i> of all that went in at the gate of his city,
c2157	saying,
c2158	Nay,
c2159	my lord,
c2160	hear
c2161	me: the field give
c2162	I thee, and the cave
c2163	that
c2164	<i>is</i> therein, I give
c2165	it thee; in the presence of the sons of my people give
c2166	I it thee: bury thy dead.
c2167	And Abraham bowed down himself before the people of the land.
c2168	And he spake unto Ephron in the audience of the people of the land,
c2169	saying,
c2170	But if thou
c2171	<i>wilt give it,</i> I pray thee, hear
c2172	me: I will give thee money for the field;
c2173	take <i>it</i> of
c2174	me, and I will bury my dead there.
c2175	And Ephron answered Abraham,
c2176	saying unto him,
c2177	My lord,
c2178	hearken
c2179	unto me: the land <i>is worth</i> four hundred shekels of silver;
c2180	what <i>is</i> that betwixt
c2181	me and thee? bury therefore thy dead.
c2182	And Abraham hearkened unto Ephron;
c2183	and Abraham weighed to Ephron the silver,
c2184	which he had named in the audience of the sons of Heth,
c2185	four hundred shekels of silver,
c2186	current <i>money</i> with the merchant.
c2187	And the field of Ephron, which <i>was</i> in Machpelah,
c2189	which <i>was</i> before Mamre,
c2190	the field, and the cave
c2191	which
c2192	<i>was</i> therein, and all the trees
c2193	that <i>were</i> in the field,
c2194	that <i>were</i> in all the borders round about, were made sure
c2195	Unto Abraham for a possession in the presence of the children of Heth, before all that went in at the gate of his city.
c2196	And after this, Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of the field of Machpelah before Mamre:
c2197	the same <i>is</i> Hebron
c2198	in the land of Canaan.
c2199	And the field, and the cave that <i>is</i> therein, were made sure
c2201	unto Abraham for a possession of a buryingplace by the sons of Heth.
c2202	And Abraham was old,
c2203	<i>and</i> well stricken in age:
c2204	and the LORD had blessed Abraham in all things.
c2205	And Abraham said unto his eldest servant of his house,
c2206	that ruled over all
c2207	that
c2208	he had, Put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh:
c2209	And I will make thee swear by the LORD, the God of heaven, and the God of the earth,
c2210	that thou shalt not take a wife unto my son of the daughters of the Canaanites,
c2211	among whom I dwell:
c2212	But thou shalt go unto my country, and to my kindred,
c2213	and take a wife unto my son Isaac.
c2214	And the servant said unto
c2215	him, Peradventure the woman will not be willing
c2216	to follow me unto this land:
c2217	must I needs bring thy son again unto the land
c2218	from whence thou camest?
c2219	And Abraham said unto
c2220	him, Beware
c2221	thou that thou bring not my son thither again.
c2222	The LORD God of heaven,
c2223	which took me from my father's house, and from the land of my kindred,
c2224	and which spake
c2225	unto me, and that sware
c2226	unto me, saying,
c2227	Unto thy seed will I give this land;
c2228	he shall send his angel before
c2229	thee, and thou shalt take a wife unto my son from thence.
c2230	And if the woman will not be willing
c2231	to follow
c2232	thee, then thou shalt be clear from this my oath:
c2233	only bring not my son thither again.
c2234	And the servant put his hand under the thigh of Abraham his master,
c2235	and sware to him concerning that matter.
c2236	And the servant took ten camels of the camels of his master,
c2237	and departed;
c2238	for all the goods of his master <i>were</i> in his hand:
c2239	and he arose,
c2240	and went to Mesopotamia, unto the city of Nahor.
c2241	And he made his camels to kneel down without the city by a well of water at the time of the evening, <i>even</i> the time
c2242	that women go out to draw <i>water.</i>
c2243	And he said,
c2244	O LORD God of my master Abraham,
c2245	I pray thee, send me good speed this day,
c2246	and shew kindness unto my master Abraham.
c2247	Behold, I stand <i>here</i> by the well of water;
c2248	and the daughters of the men of the city come out
c2249	to draw water:
c2250	And let it come to pass,
c2251	that the damsel
c2252	to whom I shall say,
c2253	Let down thy pitcher, I pray thee,
c2254	that I may drink;
c2255	and she shall say,
c2256	Drink,
c2257	and I will give thy camels drink also:
c2258	<i>let the same be</i> she <i>that</i> thou hast appointed for thy servant Isaac;
c2259	and thereby shall I know
c2260	that thou hast shewed kindness unto my master.
c2261	And it came to pass,
c2262	before he had done
c2263	speaking,
c2264	that, behold, Rebekah came out,
c2265	who was born to Bethuel, son of Milcah, the wife of Nahor, Abraham's brother,
c2266	with her pitcher upon her shoulder.
c2267	And the damsel <i>was</i> very fair to look upon,
c2268	a virgin,
c2269	neither had any man known
c2270	her: and she went down to the well,
c2271	and filled her pitcher,
c2272	and came up.
c2273	And the servant ran
c2274	to meet
c2275	her, and said,
c2276	Let me, I pray thee, drink a little water of thy pitcher.
c2277	And she said,
c2278	Drink,
c2279	my lord:
c2280	and she hasted,
c2281	and let down her pitcher upon her hand,
c2282	and gave him drink.
c2283	And when she had done
c2284	giving him drink,
c2285	she said,
c2286	I will draw <i>water</i> for thy camels also,
c2287	until they have done
c2288	drinking.
c2289	And she hasted,
c2290	and emptied her pitcher into the trough,
c2291	and ran again unto the well
c2292	to draw
c2293	<i>water,</i> and drew for all his camels.
c2294	And the man wondering at her held his peace,
c2295	to wit
c2296	whether the LORD had made his journey prosperous
c2297	or not.
c2298	And it came to pass,
c2299	as the camels had done
c2300	drinking,
c2301	that the man took a golden earring
c2302	of half a shekel weight,
c2303	and two bracelets for her hands
c2304	of ten <i>shekels</i> weight of gold;
c2305	And said,
c2306	Whose daughter <i>art</i> thou?
c2307	tell me, I pray thee:
c2308	is there room <i>in</i> thy father's house
c2309	for us to lodge in?
c2310	And she said unto
c2311	him, I <i>am</i> the daughter of Bethuel the son of Milcah,
c2312	which she bare unto Nahor.
c2313	She said moreover unto
c2314	him, We have both straw and provender enough,
c2315	and room
c2316	to lodge in.
c2317	And the man bowed down his head,
c2318	and worshipped the LORD.
c2319	And he said,
c2320	Blessed <i>be</i> the LORD God of my master Abraham,
c2321	who hath not left destitute my master of his mercy and his truth:
c2322	I
c2323	<i>being</i> in the way, the LORD led me to the house of my master's brethren.
c2324	And the damsel ran,
c2325	and told <i>them of</i> her mother's house these things.
c2326	And Rebekah had a brother,
c2327	and his name <i>was</i> Laban:
c2328	and Laban ran out unto the man, unto the well.
c2329	And it came to pass,
c2330	when he saw the earring and bracelets upon his sister's hands,
c2331	and when he heard the words of Rebekah his sister,
c2332	saying,
c2333	Thus spake the man unto
c2334	me; that he came unto the man;
c2335	and, behold, he stood by the camels at the well.
c2336	And he said,
c2337	Come in,
c2338	thou blessed of the LORD;
c2339	wherefore standest thou without?
c2340	for I have prepared the house, and room for the camels.
c2341	And the man came into the house:
c2342	and he ungirded his camels,
c2343	and gave straw and provender for the camels,
c2344	and water
c2345	to wash his feet, and the men's feet
c2346	that <i>were</i> with him.
c2347	And there was set <i>meat</i> before
c2348	him to eat:
c2349	but he said,
c2350	I will not eat,
c2351	until I have told mine errand.
c2352	And he said,
c2353	Speak on.
c2354	And he said,
c2355	I <i>am</i> Abraham's servant.
c2356	And the LORD hath blessed my master greatly;
c2357	and he is become great:
c2358	and he hath given him flocks, and herds, and silver, and gold, and menservants, and maidservants, and camels, and asses.
c2359	And Sarah my master's wife bare a son to my master when she was old:
c2360	and unto him hath he given all
c2361	that he hath.
c2362	And my master made me swear,
c2363	saying,
c2364	Thou shalt not take a wife to my son of the daughters of the Canaanites,
c2365	in whose land I dwell:
c2366	But thou shalt go unto my father's house, and to my kindred,
c2367	and take a wife unto my son.
c2368	And I said unto my master,
c2369	Peradventure the woman will not follow me.
c2370	And he said unto
c2371	me, The LORD,
c2372	before whom I walk,
c2373	will send his angel with
c2374	thee, and prosper thy way;
c2375	and thou shalt take a wife for my son of my kindred, and of my father's house:
c2376	Then shalt thou be clear from <i>this</i> my oath,
c2377	when thou comest to my kindred;
c2378	and if they give not
c2379	thee <i>one,</i> thou shalt be clear from my oath.
c2380	And I came this day unto the well,
c2381	and said,
c2382	O LORD God of my master Abraham,
c2383	if now thou do prosper my way
c2384	which I go:
c2385	Behold, I stand by the well of water;
c2386	and it shall come to pass,
c2387	that when the virgin
c2388	cometh forth
c2389	to draw
c2390	<i>water,</i> and I say to
c2391	her, Give me, I pray thee, a little water of thy pitcher to drink;
c2392	And she say to
c2393	me, Both drink thou,
c2394	and I will also draw for thy camels:
c2395	<i>let</i> the same <i>be</i> the woman
c2396	whom the LORD hath appointed out for my master's son.
c2397	And before I had done
c2398	speaking in mine heart,
c2399	behold, Rebekah came forth
c2400	with her pitcher on her shoulder;
c2401	and she went down unto the well,
c2402	and drew
c2403	<i>water:</i> and I said unto
c2404	her, Let me drink, I pray thee.
c2405	And she made haste,
c2406	and let down her pitcher from
c2407	her <i>shoulder,</i> and said,
c2408	Drink,
c2409	and I will give thy camels drink also:
c2410	so I drank,
c2411	and she made the camels drink also.
c2412	And I asked
c2413	her, and said,
c2414	Whose daughter <i>art</i> thou?
c2415	And she said,
c2416	The daughter of Bethuel, Nahor's son,
c2417	whom Milcah bare
c2418	unto him: and I put the earring upon her face,
c2419	and the bracelets upon her hands.
c2420	And I bowed down my head,
c2421	and worshipped the LORD,
c2422	and blessed the LORD God of my master Abraham,
c2423	which had led me in the right way
c2424	to take my master's brother's daughter unto his son.
c2425	And now
c2426	if ye will deal kindly and truly with my master,
c2427	tell
c2428	me: and if not,
c2429	tell
c2430	me; that I may turn to the right hand, or to the left.
c2431	Then Laban and Bethuel answered
c2432	and said,
c2433	The thing proceedeth from the LORD:
c2434	we cannot
c2435	speak unto thee bad or good.
c2436	Behold, Rebekah <i>is</i> before
c2437	thee, take
c2438	<i>her,</i> and go,
c2439	and let her be thy master's son's wife,
c2440	as the LORD hath spoken.
c2441	And it came to pass,
c2442	that, when Abraham's servant heard their words,
c2443	he worshipped the LORD, <i>bowing himself</i> to the earth.
c2444	And the servant brought forth jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment,
c2445	and gave <i>them</i> to Rebekah:
c2446	he gave also to her brother and to her mother precious things.
c2447	And they did eat
c2448	and drink, he and the men
c2449	that <i>were</i> with
c2450	him, and tarried all night;
c2451	and they rose up in the morning,
c2452	and he said,
c2453	Send me away unto my master.
c2454	And her brother and her mother said,
c2455	Let the damsel abide with us <i>a few</i> days, at the least ten;
c2456	after that she shall go.
c2457	And he said unto
c2458	them, Hinder me not,
c2459	seeing the LORD hath prospered my way;
c2460	send me away
c2461	that I may go to my master.
c2462	And they said,
c2463	We will call the damsel,
c2464	and enquire at her mouth.
c2465	And they called Rebekah,
c2466	and said unto
c2467	her, Wilt thou go with this man?
c2468	And she said,
c2469	I will go.
c2470	And they sent away Rebekah their sister, and her nurse, and Abraham's servant, and his men.
c2471	And they blessed Rebekah,
c2472	and said
c2474	unto her, Thou <i>art</i> our sister, be thou <i>the mother</i> of thousands of millions,
c2475	and let thy seed possess the gate of those which hate them.
c2476	And Rebekah arose, and her damsels,
c2477	and they rode upon the camels,
c2478	and followed the man:
c2479	and the servant took Rebekah,
c2480	and went his way.
c2481	And Isaac came
c2482	from the way of the well Lahairoi;
c2483	for he dwelt in the south country.
c2484	And Isaac went out
c2485	to meditate in the field
c2486	at the eventide:
c2487	and he lifted up his eyes,
c2488	and saw,
c2489	and, behold, the camels <i>were</i> coming.
c2490	And Rebekah lifted up her eyes,
c2491	and when she saw Isaac,
c2492	she lighted off the camel.
c2493	For she <i>had</i> said unto the servant,
c2494	What man <i>is</i> this
c2495	that walketh in the field
c2496	to meet
c2497	us? And the servant <i>had</i> said,
c2498	It <i>is</i> my master:
c2499	therefore she took a vail,
c2500	and covered herself.
c2501	And the servant told Isaac all things
c2502	that he had done.
c2503	And Isaac brought her into his mother Sarah's tent,
c2504	and took Rebekah,
c2505	and she became his wife;
c2506	and he loved
c2507	her: and Isaac was comforted after his mother's <i>death.</i>
c2508	Then again Abraham
c2509	took a wife,
c2510	and her name <i>was</i> Keturah.
c2511	And she bare him Zimran, and Jokshan, and Medan, and Midian, and Ishbak, and Shuah.
c2512	And Jokshan begat Sheba, and Dedan.
c2513	And the sons of Dedan were Asshurim, and Letushim, and Leummim.
c2514	And the sons of Midian; Ephah, and Epher, and Hanoch, and Abida, and Eldaah.
c2515	All these <i>were</i> the children of Keturah.
c2516	And Abraham gave all
c2517	that
c2518	he had unto Isaac.
c2519	But unto the sons of the concubines,
c2520	which Abraham
c2521	had, Abraham gave gifts,
c2522	and sent them away from Isaac his son,
c2523	while he yet lived,
c2524	eastward, unto the east country.
c2525	And these <i>are</i> the days of the years of Abraham's life
c2526	which he lived,
c2527	an hundred threescore and fifteen years.
c2529	Then Abraham gave up the ghost, and died in a good old age, an old man, and full
c2530	<i>of years;</i> and was gathered to his people.
c2531	And his sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of Machpelah, in the field of Ephron the son of Zohar the Hittite,
c2532	which <i>is</i> before Mamre;
c2533	The field
c2534	which Abraham purchased of the sons of Heth:
c2535	there was Abraham buried, and Sarah his wife.
c2536	And it came to pass after the death of Abraham,
c2537	that God blessed his son Isaac;
c2538	and Isaac dwelt by the well Lahairoi.
c2539	Now these <i>are</i> the generations of Ishmael, Abraham's son,
c2540	whom Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah's handmaid, bare unto Abraham:
c2541	And these <i>are</i> the names of the sons of Ishmael, by their names, according to their generations:
c2542	the firstborn of Ishmael, Nebajoth; and Kedar, and Adbeel, and Mibsam,
c2543	And Mishma, and Dumah, and Massa,
c2544	Hadar, and Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah:
c2545	These
c2546	<i>are</i> the sons of Ishmael,
c2547	and these <i>are</i> their names, by their towns, and by their castles;
c2548	twelve princes according to their nations.
c2549	And these <i>are</i> the years of the life of Ishmael,
c2550	an hundred and thirty and seven years:
c2551	and he gave up the ghost
c2552	and died;
c2553	and was gathered unto his people.
c2554	And they dwelt from Havilah unto Shur,
c2555	that <i>is</i> before Egypt,
c2556	as thou goest toward Assyria:
c2557	<i>and</i> he died in the presence of all his brethren.
c2558	And these <i>are</i> the generations of Isaac, Abraham's son:
c2559	Abraham begat Isaac:
c2560	And Isaac was forty years old
c2561	when he took Rebekah to wife, the daughter of Bethuel the Syrian of Padanaram, the sister to Laban the Syrian.
c2562	And Isaac intreated the LORD for his wife,
c2563	because she <i>was</i> barren:
c2564	and the LORD was intreated
c2565	of him, and Rebekah his wife conceived.
c2566	And the children struggled together within
c2567	her; and she said,
c2568	If <i>it be</i> so,
c2569	why <i>am</i> I thus?
c2570	And she went
c2571	to enquire of the LORD.
c2572	And the LORD said
c2573	unto her, Two nations <i>are</i> in thy womb,
c2574	and two manner of people shall be separated from thy bowels;
c2575	and <i>the one</i> people shall be stronger than <i>the other</i> people;
c2576	and the elder shall serve the younger.
c2577	And when her days to be delivered were fulfilled,
c2579	behold, <i>there were</i> twins in her womb.
c2580	And the first came out red,
c2581	all over like an hairy garment;
c2582	and they called his name Esau.
c2583	And after that came his brother
c2584	out, and his hand took hold on Esau's heel;
c2585	and his name was called Jacob:
c2586	and Isaac <i>was</i> threescore years old
c2587	when she bare them.
c2588	And the boys grew:
c2589	and Esau was a cunning hunter, a man
c2591	of the field; and Jacob <i>was</i> a plain man,
c2593	dwelling in tents.
c2594	And Isaac loved Esau,
c2595	because he did eat of <i>his</i> venison:
c2596	but Rebekah loved Jacob.
c2597	And Jacob sod pottage:
c2598	and Esau came from the field,
c2599	and he <i>was</i> faint:
c2600	And Esau said to Jacob,
c2601	Feed me, I pray thee, with that same red
c2602	<i>pottage;</i> for I <i>am</i> faint:
c2603	therefore was his name called Edom.
c2604	And Jacob said,
c2605	Sell me this day thy birthright.
c2606	And Esau said,
c2607	Behold, I <i>am</i> at the point
c2608	to die:
c2609	and what profit shall this birthright do to me?
c2610	And Jacob said,
c2611	Swear to me this day;
c2612	and he sware
c2613	unto him: and he sold his birthright unto Jacob.
c2614	Then Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentiles;
c2615	and he did eat
c2616	and drink,
c2617	and rose up,
c2618	and went his way:
c2619	thus Esau despised <i>his</i> birthright.
c2620	And there was a famine in the land, beside the first famine
c2621	that was in the days of Abraham.
c2622	And Isaac went unto Abimelech king of the Philistines unto Gerar.
c2623	And the LORD appeared unto
c2624	him, and said,
c2625	Go not down into Egypt;
c2626	dwell in the land
c2627	which I shall tell thee of:
c2628	Sojourn in this land,
c2629	and I will be with
c2630	thee, and will bless
c2631	thee; for unto thee, and unto thy seed, I will give all these countries,
c2632	and I will perform the oath
c2633	which I sware unto Abraham thy father;
c2634	And I will make thy seed to multiply as the stars of heaven,
c2635	and will give unto thy seed all these countries;
c2636	and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed;
c2637	Because that Abraham obeyed my voice,
c2638	and kept my charge, my commandments, my statutes, and my laws.
c2639	And Isaac dwelt in Gerar:
c2640	And the men of the place asked <i>him</i> of his wife;
c2641	and he said,
c2642	She <i>is</i> my sister:
c2643	for he feared
c2644	to say,
c2645	<i>She is</i> my wife;
c2646	lest, <i>said he,</i> the men of the place should kill me for Rebekah;
c2647	because she <i>was</i> fair to look upon.
c2648	And it came to pass,
c2649	when he had been there a long time,
c2650	that Abimelech king of the Philistines looked out at a window,
c2651	and saw,
c2652	and, behold, Isaac <i>was</i> sporting with Rebekah his wife.
c2653	And Abimelech called Isaac,
c2654	and said,
c2655	Behold, of a surety she <i>is</i> thy wife:
c2656	and how saidst
c2657	thou, She <i>is</i> my sister?
c2658	And Isaac said unto
c2659	him, Because I said,
c2660	Lest I die for her.
c2661	And Abimelech said,
c2662	What <i>is</i> this thou hast done
c2663	unto us? one of the people might lightly have lien with thy wife,
c2664	and thou shouldest have brought guiltiness upon us.
c2665	And Abimelech charged all <i>his</i> people,
c2666	saying,
c2667	He that toucheth this man or his wife
c2668	shall surely be put to death.
c2669	Then Isaac sowed in that land,
c2670	and received in the same year an hundredfold:
c2671	and the LORD blessed him.
c2672	And the man waxed great,
c2673	and went forward, and grew until he became very great:
c2675	For he had possession of flocks, and possession of herds, and great store of servants:
c2676	and the Philistines envied him.
c2677	For all the wells
c2678	which his father's servants had digged in the days of Abraham his father,
c2679	the Philistines had stopped
c2680	them, and filled them with earth.
c2681	And Abimelech said unto Isaac,
c2682	Go from
c2683	us; for thou art much mightier than we.
c2684	And Isaac departed thence,
c2685	and pitched his tent in the valley of Gerar,
c2686	and dwelt there.
c2687	And Isaac digged again
c2688	the wells of water,
c2689	which they had digged in the days of Abraham his father;
c2690	for the Philistines had stopped them after the death of Abraham:
c2691	and he called their names after the names
c2692	by which his father had called them.
c2693	And Isaac's servants digged in the valley,
c2694	and found there a well of springing water.
c2695	And the herdmen of Gerar did strive with Isaac's herdmen,
c2696	saying,
c2697	The water
c2698	<i>is</i> ours: and he called the name of the well Esek;
c2699	because they strove with him.
c2700	And they digged another well,
c2701	and strove for that also:
c2702	and he called the name of it Sitnah.
c2703	And he removed from thence,
c2704	and digged another well;
c2705	and for that they strove not:
c2706	and he called the name of it Rehoboth;
c2707	and he said,
c2708	For now the LORD hath made room
c2709	for us, and we shall be fruitful in the land.
c2710	And he went up from thence to Beersheba.
c2711	And the LORD appeared unto him the same night,
c2712	and said,
c2713	I <i>am</i> the God of Abraham thy father:
c2714	fear not,
c2715	for I <i>am</i> with
c2716	thee, and will bless
c2717	thee, and multiply thy seed for my servant Abraham's sake.
c2718	And he builded an altar there,
c2719	and called upon the name of the LORD,
c2720	and pitched his tent there:
c2721	and there Isaac's servants digged a well.
c2722	Then Abimelech went to him from Gerar,
c2723	and Ahuzzath one of his friends, and Phichol the chief captain of his army.
c2724	And Isaac said unto
c2725	them, Wherefore come ye to
c2726	me, seeing ye hate
c2727	me, and have sent me away from you?
c2728	And they said,
c2729	We saw certainly
c2730	that the LORD was with
c2731	thee: and we said,
c2732	Let there be now an oath betwixt us, <i>even</i> betwixt
c2733	us and thee, and let us make a covenant with thee;
c2734	That thou wilt do us no hurt, as we have not touched
c2736	thee, and as we have done unto thee nothing but good,
c2737	and have sent thee away in peace:
c2738	thou <i>art</i> now the blessed of the LORD.
c2739	And he made them a feast,
c2740	and they did eat
c2741	and drink.
c2742	And they rose up betimes in the morning,
c2743	and sware
c2744	one to another:
c2745	and Isaac sent them away,
c2746	and they departed from him in peace.
c2747	And it came to pass the same day,
c2748	that Isaac's servants came,
c2749	and told him concerning the well
c2750	which they had digged,
c2751	and said
c2752	unto him, We have found water.
c2753	And he called it Shebah:
c2754	therefore the name of the city <i>is</i> Beersheba unto this day.
c2755	And Esau was forty years old
c2756	when he took to wife Judith the daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and Bashemath the daughter of Elon the Hittite:
c2757	Which were a grief of mind unto Isaac and to Rebekah.
c2758	And it came to pass,
c2759	that when Isaac was old,
c2760	and his eyes were dim,
c2761	so that he could not see,
c2762	he called Esau his eldest son,
c2763	and said unto
c2764	him, My son:
c2765	and he said unto
c2766	him, Behold, <i>here am</i> I.
c2767	And he said,
c2768	Behold now, I am old,
c2769	I know not the day of my death:
c2770	Now
c2771	therefore take, I pray thee, thy weapons, thy quiver and thy bow,
c2772	and go out to the field,
c2773	and take me <i>some</i> venison;
c2774	And make me savoury meat,
c2775	such as I love,
c2776	and bring
c2777	<i>it</i> to me, that I may eat;
c2778	that my soul may bless
c2779	thee before I die.
c2780	And Rebekah heard
c2781	when Isaac spake to Esau his son.
c2782	And Esau went to the field
c2783	to hunt <i>for</i> venison,
c2784	<i>and</i> to bring <i>it.</i>
c2785	And Rebekah spake unto Jacob her son,
c2786	saying,
c2787	Behold, I heard thy father
c2788	speak unto Esau thy brother,
c2789	saying,
c2790	Bring me venison,
c2791	and make me savoury meat,
c2792	that I may eat,
c2793	and bless thee before the LORD before my death.
c2794	Now
c2795	therefore, my son,
c2796	obey my voice
c2797	according to that which I command thee.
c2798	Go now to the flock,
c2799	and fetch me from thence two good kids of the goats;
c2800	and I will make them savoury meat for thy father,
c2801	such as he loveth:
c2802	And thou shalt bring <i>it</i> to thy father,
c2803	that he may eat,
c2804	and that he may bless thee before his death.
c2805	And Jacob said to Rebekah his mother,
c2806	Behold, Esau my brother <i>is</i> a hairy man,
c2807	and I <i>am</i> a smooth man:
c2808	My father peradventure will feel
c2809	me, and I shall seem to him as a deceiver;
c2810	and I shall bring a curse upon
c2811	me, and not a blessing.
c2812	And his mother said
c2813	unto him, Upon me <i>be</i> thy curse,
c2814	my son:
c2815	only obey my voice,
c2816	and go
c2817	fetch me <i>them.</i>
c2818	And he went,
c2819	and fetched,
c2820	and brought <i>them</i> to his mother:
c2821	and his mother made savoury meat,
c2822	such as his father loved.
c2823	And Rebekah took goodly raiment of her eldest son Esau,
c2824	which <i>were</i> with her in the house,
c2825	and put them upon Jacob her younger son:
c2826	And she put the skins of the kids of the goats upon his hands, and upon the smooth of his neck:
c2827	And she gave the savoury meat and the bread,
c2828	which she had prepared,
c2829	into the hand of her son Jacob.
c2830	And he came unto his father,
c2831	and said,
c2832	My father:
c2833	and he said,
c2834	Here
c2835	<i>am</i> I; who <i>art</i> thou,
c2836	my son?
c2837	And Jacob said unto his father,
c2838	I <i>am</i> Esau thy firstborn;
c2839	I have done
c2840	according as thou badest
c2841	me: arise, I pray thee,
c2842	sit
c2843	and eat of my venison,
c2844	that thy soul may bless me.
c2845	And Isaac said unto his son,
c2846	How <i>is it</i> that thou hast found <i>it</i> so quickly,
c2848	my son?
c2849	And he said,
c2850	Because the LORD thy God brought <i>it</i> to me.
c2851	And Isaac said unto Jacob,
c2852	Come near, I pray thee,
c2853	that I may feel
c2854	thee, my son,
c2855	whether thou <i>be</i> my very son Esau
c2856	or not.
c2857	And Jacob went near unto Isaac his father;
c2858	and he felt
c2859	him, and said,
c2860	The voice <i>is</i> Jacob's voice,
c2861	but the hands <i>are</i> the hands of Esau.
c2862	And he discerned him not,
c2863	because his hands were hairy, as his brother Esau's hands:
c2864	so he blessed him.
c2865	And he said,
c2866	<i>Art</i> thou my very son Esau?
c2867	And he said,
c2868	I <i>am.</i>
c2869	And he said,
c2870	Bring <i>it</i> near
c2871	to me, and I will eat of my son's venison,
c2872	that my soul may bless
c2873	thee. And he brought <i>it</i> near
c2874	to him, and he did eat:
c2875	and he brought him wine,
c2876	and he drank.
c2877	And his father Isaac said unto
c2878	him, Come near now,
c2879	and kiss
c2880	me, my son.
c2881	And he came near,
c2882	and kissed
c2883	him: and he smelled the smell of his raiment,
c2884	and blessed
c2885	him, and said,
c2886	See,
c2887	the smell of my son <i>is</i> as the smell of a field
c2888	which the LORD hath blessed:
c2889	Therefore God give thee of the dew of heaven, and the fatness of the earth,
c2890	and plenty of corn and wine:
c2891	Let people serve
c2892	thee, and nations bow down
c2893	to thee: be lord over thy brethren,
c2894	and let thy mother's sons bow down
c2895	to thee: cursed <i>be</i> every one that curseth
c2896	thee, and blessed <i>be</i> he that blesseth thee.
c2897	And it came to pass,
c2898	as soon as Isaac had made an end
c2899	of blessing Jacob,
c2901	and Jacob was yet scarce gone out from the presence of Isaac his father,
c2902	that Esau his brother came in from his hunting.
c2903	And he also had made savoury meat,
c2904	and brought it unto his father,
c2905	and said unto his father,
c2906	arise,
c2907	Let my father
c2908	and eat of his son's venison,
c2909	that thy soul may bless me.
c2910	And Isaac his father said
c2911	unto him, Who <i>art</i> thou?
c2912	And he said,
c2913	I <i>am</i> thy son, thy firstborn Esau.
c2914	And Isaac trembled very exceedingly,
c2915	and said,
c2916	Who? where <i>is</i> he
c2917	that hath taken venison,
c2918	and brought
c2919	<i>it</i> me, and I have eaten of all
c2920	before thou camest,
c2921	and have blessed
c2922	him? yea, <i>and</i> he shall be blessed.
c2923	And when Esau heard the words of his father,
c2924	he cried with a great and exceeding bitter cry,
c2925	and said unto his father,
c2926	Bless
c2927	me, <i>even</i> me also,
c2928	O my father.
c2929	And he said,
c2930	Thy brother came with subtilty,
c2931	and hath taken away thy blessing.
c2932	And he said,
c2933	Is not he rightly named Jacob?
c2934	for he hath supplanted me these two times:
c2935	he took away my birthright;
c2936	and, behold, now he hath taken away my blessing.
c2937	And he said,
c2938	Hast thou not reserved a blessing for me?
c2939	And Isaac answered
c2940	and said unto Esau,
c2941	Behold, I have made him thy lord,
c2942	and all his brethren have I given to him for servants;
c2943	and with corn and wine have I sustained
c2944	now
c2945	him: and what shall I do
c2946	unto thee, my son?
c2947	And Esau said unto his father,
c2948	Hast thou but one blessing,
c2950	my father?
c2951	bless
c2952	me, <i>even</i> me also,
c2953	O my father.
c2954	And Esau lifted up his voice,
c2955	and wept.
c2956	And Isaac his father answered
c2957	and said unto
c2958	him, Behold, thy dwelling shall be the fatness of the earth,
c2959	and of the dew of heaven from above;
c2960	And by thy sword shalt thou live,
c2961	and shalt serve thy brother;
c2962	and it shall come to pass
c2963	when thou shalt have the dominion,
c2964	that thou shalt break his yoke from off thy neck.
c2965	And Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing
c2966	wherewith his father blessed
c2967	him: and Esau said in his heart,
c2968	The days of mourning for my father are at hand;
c2969	then will I slay my brother Jacob.
c2970	And these words of Esau her elder son were told to Rebekah:
c2971	and she sent
c2972	and called Jacob her younger son,
c2973	and said unto
c2974	him, Behold, thy brother Esau, as touching thee, doth comfort himself,
c2975	<i>purposing</i> to kill thee.
c2976	Now
c2977	therefore, my son,
c2978	obey my voice;
c2979	and arise,
c2980	flee thou to Laban my brother to Haran;
c2981	And tarry with him a few days,
c2982	until thy brother's fury turn away;
c2983	Until thy brother's anger turn away from
c2984	thee, and he forget
c2985	<i>that</i> which thou hast done
c2986	to him: then I will send,
c2987	and fetch thee from thence:
c2988	why should I be deprived also of you both in one day?
c2989	And Rebekah said to Isaac,
c2990	I am weary of my life because of the daughters of Heth:
c2991	if Jacob take a wife of the daughters of Heth, such as these <i>which are</i> of the daughters of the land,
c2992	what good shall my life do me?
c2993	And Isaac called Jacob,
c2994	and blessed
c2995	him, and charged
c2996	him, and said
c2997	unto him, Thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan.
c2998	Arise,
c2999	go to Padanaram, to the house of Bethuel thy mother's father;
c3000	and take thee a wife from thence of the daughters of Laban thy mother's brother.
c3001	And God Almighty bless
c3002	thee, and make thee fruitful,
c3003	and multiply
c3004	thee, that thou mayest be a multitude of people;
c3005	And give thee the blessing of Abraham, to thee, and to thy seed with
c3006	thee; that thou mayest inherit the land wherein thou art a stranger,
c3007	which God gave unto Abraham.
c3008	And Isaac sent away Jacob:
c3009	and he went to Padanaram unto Laban, son of Bethuel the Syrian, the brother of Rebekah, Jacob's and Esau's mother.
c3010	When Esau saw
c3011	that Isaac had blessed Jacob,
c3012	and sent him away to Padanaram,
c3013	to take him a wife from thence;
c3014	and that as he blessed
c3015	him he gave him a charge,
c3016	saying,
c3017	Thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan;
c3018	And that Jacob obeyed his father and his mother,
c3019	and was gone to Padanaram;
c3020	And Esau seeing
c3021	that the daughters of Canaan pleased not Isaac his father;
c3022	Then went Esau unto Ishmael,
c3023	and took unto the wives which he had Mahalath the daughter of Ishmael Abraham's son, the sister of Nebajoth, to be his wife.
c3024	And Jacob went out from Beersheba,
c3025	and went toward Haran.
c3026	And he lighted upon a certain place,
c3027	and tarried there all night,
c3028	because the sun was set;
c3029	and he took of the stones of that place,
c3030	and put <i>them for</i> his pillows,
c3031	and lay down in that place to sleep.
c3032	And he dreamed,
c3033	and behold a ladder set up on the earth,
c3034	and the top of it reached to heaven:
c3035	and behold the angels of God ascending
c3036	and descending on it.
c3037	And, behold, the LORD stood above
c3038	it, and said,
c3039	I <i>am</i> the LORD God of Abraham thy father, and the God of Isaac:
c3040	the land
c3041	whereon thou liest,
c3042	to thee will I give
c3043	it, and to thy seed;
c3044	And thy seed shall be as the dust of the earth,
c3045	and thou shalt spread abroad to the west, and to the east, and to the north, and to the south:
c3046	and in thee and in thy seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed.
c3047	And, behold, I <i>am</i> with
c3048	thee, and will keep thee in all
c3049	<i>places</i> whither thou goest,
c3050	and will bring thee again into this land;
c3051	for I will not leave
c3052	thee, until I have done
c3053	<i>that</i> which I have spoken to thee of.
c3054	And Jacob awaked out of his sleep,
c3055	and he said,
c3056	Surely the LORD is in this place;
c3057	and I knew <i>it</i> not.
c3058	And he was afraid,
c3059	and said,
c3060	How dreadful <i>is</i> this place!
c3061	this <i>is</i> none
c3062	other but the house of God,
c3063	and this <i>is</i> the gate of heaven.
c3064	And Jacob rose up early in the morning,
c3065	and took the stone
c3066	that he had put <i>for</i> his pillows,
c3067	and set it up <i>for</i> a pillar,
c3068	and poured oil upon the top of it.
c3069	And he called the name of that place Bethel:
c3070	but the name of that city <i>was called</i> Luz at the first.
c3071	And Jacob vowed a vow,
c3072	saying,
c3073	If God will be with
c3074	me, and will keep me in this way
c3075	that I go,
c3076	and will give me bread
c3077	to eat,
c3078	and raiment
c3079	to put on,
c3080	So that I come again to my father's house in peace;
c3081	then shall the LORD be my God:
c3082	And this stone,
c3083	which I have set <i>for</i> a pillar,
c3084	shall be God's house:
c3085	and of all
c3086	that thou shalt give
c3087	me I will surely give the tenth unto thee.
c3088	Then Jacob went on his journey,
c3089	and came into the land of the people of the east.
c3090	And he looked,
c3091	and behold a well in the field,
c3092	and, lo, there <i>were</i> three flocks of sheep lying by
c3093	it; for out of that well they watered the flocks:
c3094	and a great stone <i>was</i> upon the well's mouth.
c3095	And thither were all the flocks gathered:
c3096	and they rolled the stone from the well's mouth,
c3097	and watered the sheep,
c3098	and put the stone again upon the well's mouth in his place.
c3099	And Jacob said
c3100	unto them, My brethren,
c3101	whence <i>be</i> ye?
c3102	And they said,
c3103	Of Haran <i>are</i> we.
c3104	And he said
c3105	unto them, Know ye Laban the son of Nahor?
c3106	And they said,
c3107	We know <i>him.</i>
c3108	And he said
c3109	unto them, <i>Is</i> he well?
c3110	And they said,
c3111	<i>He is</i> well:
c3112	and, behold, Rachel his daughter cometh with the sheep.
c3113	And he said,
c3114	Lo, <i>it is</i> yet high day,
c3115	neither <i>is it</i> time
c3116	that the cattle should be gathered together:
c3117	water ye the sheep,
c3118	and go
c3119	<i>and</i> feed <i>them.</i>
c3120	And they said,
c3121	We cannot,
c3122	until all the flocks be gathered together,
c3123	and <i>till</i> they roll the stone from the well's mouth;
c3124	then we water the sheep.
c3125	And while he yet spake with
c3126	them, Rachel came with her father's sheep:
c3128	for she kept them.
c3129	And it came to pass,
c3130	when Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of Laban his mother's brother, and the sheep of Laban his mother's brother,
c3131	that Jacob went near,
c3132	and rolled the stone from the well's mouth,
c3133	and watered the flock of Laban his mother's brother.
c3134	And Jacob kissed Rachel,
c3135	and lifted up his voice,
c3136	and wept.
c3137	And Jacob told Rachel
c3138	that he <i>was</i> her father's brother,
c3139	and that he <i>was</i> Rebekah's son:
c3140	and she ran
c3141	and told her father.
c3142	And it came to pass,
c3143	when Laban heard the tidings of Jacob his sister's son,
c3144	that he ran
c3145	to meet
c3146	him, and embraced
c3147	him, and kissed
c3148	him, and brought him to his house.
c3149	And he told Laban all these things.
c3150	And Laban said
c3151	to him, Surely thou <i>art</i> my bone and my flesh.
c3152	And he abode with him the space of a month.
c3153	And Laban said unto Jacob,
c3154	Because thou <i>art</i> my brother,
c3155	shouldest thou therefore serve me for nought?
c3156	tell
c3157	me, what <i>shall</i> thy wages <i>be?</i>
c3158	And Laban had two daughters:
c3159	the name of the elder <i>was</i> Leah,
c3160	and the name of the younger <i>was</i> Rachel.
c3161	Leah <i>was</i> tender eyed;
c3162	but Rachel was beautiful and well favoured.
c3163	And Jacob loved Rachel;
c3164	and said,
c3165	I will serve thee seven years for Rachel thy younger daughter.
c3166	And Laban said,
c3167	<i>It is</i> better
c3168	that I give
c3169	her to thee, than that I should give her to another man:
c3170	abide with me.
c3171	And Jacob served seven years for Rachel;
c3172	and they seemed unto him <i>but</i> a few days, for the love he had to her.
c3173	And Jacob said unto Laban,
c3174	Give <i>me</i> my wife,
c3175	for my days are fulfilled,
c3176	that I may go in unto her.
c3177	And Laban gathered together all the men of the place,
c3178	and made a feast.
c3179	And it came to pass in the evening,
c3180	that he took Leah his daughter,
c3181	and brought her to
c3182	him; and he went in unto her.
c3183	And Laban gave unto his daughter Leah Zilpah his maid
c3184	<i>for</i> an handmaid.
c3185	And it came to pass, that in the morning,
c3186	behold, it <i>was</i> Leah:
c3187	and he said to Laban,
c3188	What <i>is</i> this thou hast done
c3189	unto me? did not I serve with thee for Rachel?
c3190	wherefore then hast thou beguiled me?
c3191	And Laban said,
c3192	It must not be so done in our country,
c3193	to give the younger before the firstborn.
c3194	Fulfil her week,
c3195	and we will give thee this also for the service
c3196	which thou shalt serve with me yet seven other years.
c3197	And Jacob did so,
c3198	and fulfilled her week:
c3199	and he gave him Rachel his daughter
c3200	to wife also.
c3201	And Laban gave to Rachel his daughter Bilhah his handmaid
c3202	to be her maid.
c3203	And he went in also unto Rachel,
c3204	and he loved also Rachel more than Leah,
c3205	and served with him yet seven other years.
c3206	And when the LORD saw
c3207	that Leah <i>was</i> hated,
c3208	he opened her womb:
c3209	but Rachel <i>was</i> barren.
c3210	And Leah conceived,
c3211	and bare a son,
c3212	and she called his name Reuben:
c3213	for she said,
c3214	Surely the LORD hath looked upon my affliction;
c3215	now therefore my husband will love me.
c3216	And she conceived again,
c3217	and bare a son;
c3218	and said,
c3219	Because the LORD hath heard
c3220	that I <i>was</i> hated,
c3221	he hath therefore given me this <i>son</i> also:
c3222	and she called his name Simeon.
c3223	And she conceived again,
c3224	and bare a son;
c3225	and said,
c3226	Now this time will my husband be joined unto
c3227	me, because I have born him three sons:
c3228	therefore was his name called Levi.
c3229	And she conceived again,
c3230	and bare a son:
c3231	and she said,
c3232	Now will I praise the LORD:
c3233	therefore she called his name Judah;
c3234	and left
c3235	bearing.
c3236	And when Rachel saw
c3237	that she bare Jacob no children,
c3238	Rachel envied her sister;
c3239	and said unto Jacob,
c3240	Give me children,
c3241	or else
c3242	I die.
c3243	And Jacob's anger was kindled against Rachel:
c3244	and he said,
c3245	<i>Am</i> I in God's stead,
c3246	who hath withheld from thee the fruit of the womb?
c3247	And she said,
c3248	Behold my maid Bilhah,
c3249	go in unto
c3250	her; and she shall bear upon my knees,
c3251	that I may also have children by her.
c3252	And she gave him Bilhah her handmaid to wife:
c3253	and Jacob went in unto her.
c3254	And Bilhah conceived,
c3255	and bare Jacob a son.
c3256	And Rachel said,
c3257	God hath judged
c3258	me, and hath also heard my voice,
c3259	and hath given me a son:
c3260	therefore called she his name Dan.
c3262	And Bilhah Rachel's maid conceived again, and bare Jacob a second son.
c3263	And Rachel said,
c3264	With great wrestlings have I wrestled with my sister,
c3265	and I have prevailed:
c3266	and she called his name Naphtali.
c3267	When Leah saw
c3268	that she had left
c3269	bearing,
c3270	she took Zilpah her maid,
c3271	and gave her Jacob to wife.
c3272	And Zilpah Leah's maid bare Jacob a son.
c3273	And Leah said,
c3274	A troop cometh:
c3275	and she called his name Gad.
c3276	And Zilpah Leah's maid bare Jacob a second son.
c3277	And Leah said,
c3278	Happy
c3279	am I, for the daughters will call me blessed:
c3280	and she called his name Asher.
c3281	And Reuben went in the days of wheat harvest,
c3282	and found mandrakes in the field,
c3283	and brought them unto his mother Leah.
c3284	Then Rachel said to Leah,
c3285	Give me, I pray thee, of thy son's mandrakes.
c3286	And she said
c3287	unto her, <i>Is it</i> a small matter
c3288	that thou hast taken my husband?
c3289	and wouldest thou take away my son's mandrakes also?
c3290	And Rachel said,
c3291	Therefore he shall lie with thee to night for thy son's mandrakes.
c3292	And Jacob came out of the field in the evening,
c3293	and Leah went out
c3294	to meet
c3295	him, and said,
c3296	Thou must come in unto
c3297	me; for surely I have hired thee with my son's mandrakes.
c3298	And he lay with her that night.
c3299	And God hearkened unto Leah,
c3300	and she conceived,
c3301	and bare Jacob the fifth son.
c3302	And Leah said,
c3303	God hath given me my hire,
c3304	because I have given my maiden to my husband:
c3305	and she called his name Issachar.
c3306	And Leah conceived again,
c3307	and bare Jacob the sixth son.
c3308	And Leah said,
c3309	God hath endued me <i>with</i> a good dowry;
c3310	now will my husband dwell with
c3311	me, because I have born him six sons:
c3312	and she called his name Zebulun.
c3313	And afterwards she bare a daughter,
c3314	and called her name Dinah.
c3315	And God remembered Rachel,
c3316	and God hearkened to
c3317	her, and opened her womb.
c3318	And she conceived,
c3319	and bare a son;
c3320	and said,
c3321	God hath taken away my reproach:
c3322	And she called his name Joseph;
c3323	and said,
c3324	The LORD shall add to me another son.
c3325	And it came to pass,
c3326	when Rachel had born Joseph,
c3327	that Jacob said unto Laban,
c3328	Send me away,
c3329	that I may go unto mine own place, and to my country.
c3330	Give <i>me</i> my wives and my children,
c3331	for whom I have served
c3332	thee, and let me go:
c3333	for thou knowest my service
c3334	which I have done thee.
c3335	And Laban said unto
c3336	him, I pray thee, if I have found favour in thine eyes,
c3337	<i>tarry: for</i> I have learned by experience
c3338	that the LORD hath blessed me for thy sake.
c3339	And he said,
c3340	Appoint me thy wages,
c3341	and I will give <i>it.</i>
c3342	And he said unto
c3343	him, Thou knowest
c3344	how I have served
c3345	thee, and how thy cattle was with me.
c3346	For <i>it was</i> little
c3347	which thou hadst before
c3348	I <i>came,</i> and it is <i>now</i> increased unto a multitude;
c3349	and the LORD hath blessed thee since my coming:
c3350	and now
c3351	when shall I provide for mine own house also?
c3352	And he said,
c3353	What shall I give
c3354	thee? And Jacob said,
c3355	Thou shalt not give me any thing:
c3356	if thou wilt do this thing
c3357	for me, I will again
c3358	feed <i>and</i> keep thy flock:
c3360	I will pass through all thy flock to day,
c3361	removing from thence all the speckled and spotted cattle, and all the brown cattle among the sheep, and the spotted and speckled among the goats:
c3362	and <i>of such</i> shall be my hire.
c3363	So shall my righteousness answer for me in time to come,
c3364	when it shall come for my hire before thy face:
c3365	every one
c3366	that <i>is</i> not speckled and spotted among the goats, and brown among the sheep,
c3367	that shall be counted stolen with me.
c3368	And Laban said,
c3369	Behold,
c3370	I would it might be according to thy word.
c3371	And he removed that day the he goats that were ringstraked and spotted, and all the she goats that were speckled and spotted, <i>and</i> every one
c3372	that had <i>some</i> white
c3373	in it, and all the brown among the sheep,
c3374	and gave <i>them</i> into the hand of his sons.
c3375	And he set three days' journey betwixt himself and Jacob:
c3376	and Jacob fed the rest of Laban's flocks.
c3378	And Jacob took him rods of green poplar, and of the hazel and chesnut tree;
c3379	and pilled white strakes in them,
c3380	and made the white appear
c3381	which <i>was</i> in the rods.
c3382	And he set the rods
c3383	which he had pilled
c3384	in the gutters in the watering troughs
c3385	when the flocks came
c3386	to drink,
c3387	before the flocks
c3388	that they should conceive
c3389	when they came
c3390	to drink.
c3391	And the flocks conceived before the rods,
c3392	and brought forth cattle ringstraked, speckled, and spotted.
c3393	And Jacob did separate the lambs,
c3394	and set the faces of the flocks toward the ringstraked, and all the brown in the flock of Laban;
c3395	and he put his own flocks by themselves,
c3396	and put them not unto Laban's cattle.
c3397	And it came to pass, whensoever
c3398	the stronger cattle did conceive,
c3399	that Jacob laid the rods before the eyes of the cattle in the gutters,
c3400	that they might conceive among the rods.
c3402	But when the cattle were feeble,
c3403	he put <i>them</i> not
c3404	in: so the feebler were Laban's,
c3405	and the stronger Jacob's.
c3406	And the man increased exceedingly,
c3407	and had much cattle, and maidservants, and menservants, and camels, and asses.
c3408	And he heard the words of Laban's sons,
c3409	saying,
c3410	Jacob hath taken away all
c3411	that <i>was</i> our father's;
c3413	and of <i>that</i> which <i>was</i> our father's
c3414	hath he gotten all this glory.
c3415	And Jacob beheld the countenance of Laban,
c3416	and, behold, it <i>was</i> not toward him as before.
c3417	And the LORD said unto Jacob,
c3418	Return unto the land of thy fathers, and to thy kindred;
c3419	and I will be with thee.
c3420	And Jacob sent
c3421	and called Rachel and Leah to the field unto his flock,
c3422	And said
c3423	unto them, I see your father's countenance,
c3424	that it <i>is</i> not toward me as before;
c3425	but the God of my father hath been with me.
c3426	And ye know
c3427	that with all my power I have served your father.
c3428	And your father hath deceived
c3429	me, and changed my wages ten times;
c3430	but God suffered him not
c3431	to hurt me.
c3432	If he said thus,
c3433	The speckled shall be thy wages;
c3434	then all the cattle bare speckled:
c3435	and if he said thus,
c3436	The ringstraked shall be thy hire;
c3437	then bare all the cattle ringstraked.
c3438	Thus God hath taken away the cattle of your father,
c3439	and given <i>them</i> to me.
c3440	And it came to pass at the time
c3441	that the cattle conceived,
c3442	that I lifted up mine eyes,
c3443	and saw in a dream,
c3444	and, behold, the rams
c3445	which leaped upon the cattle
c3446	<i>were</i> ringstraked, speckled, and grisled.
c3447	And the angel of God spake unto me in a dream,
c3448	<i>saying,</i> Jacob:
c3449	And I said,
c3450	Here <i>am</i> I.
c3451	And he said,
c3452	Lift up now thine eyes,
c3453	and see,
c3454	all the rams
c3455	which leap upon the cattle
c3456	<i>are</i> ringstraked, speckled, and grisled:
c3457	for I have seen all
c3458	that Laban doeth unto thee.
c3459	I <i>am</i> the God of Bethel,
c3460	where thou anointedst the pillar,
c3461	<i>and</i> where thou vowedst a vow
c3462	unto me: now arise,
c3463	get thee out from this land,
c3464	and return unto the land of thy kindred.
c3465	And Rachel and Leah answered
c3466	and said
c3467	unto him, <i>Is there</i> yet any portion or inheritance for us in our father's house?
c3468	Are we not counted of him strangers?
c3469	for he hath sold
c3470	us, and hath quite devoured also our money.
c3471	For all the riches
c3472	which God hath taken from our father,
c3473	that <i>is</i> ours, and our children's:
c3474	now
c3475	then, whatsoever
c3476	God hath said unto
c3477	thee, do.
c3478	Then Jacob rose up,
c3479	and set his sons and his wives upon camels;
c3480	And he carried away all his cattle, and all his goods
c3481	which he had gotten,
c3482	the cattle of his getting,
c3483	which he had gotten in Padanaram,
c3484	for to go to Isaac his father in the land of Canaan.
c3485	And Laban went
c3486	to shear his sheep:
c3487	and Rachel had stolen the images
c3488	that <i>were</i> her father's.
c3489	And Jacob stole away unawares to Laban the Syrian,
c3490	in that he told him not
c3491	that he fled.
c3492	So he fled with all
c3493	that
c3494	he had; and he rose up,
c3495	and passed over the river,
c3496	and set his face <i>toward</i> the mount Gilead.
c3497	And it was told Laban on the third day
c3498	that Jacob was fled.
c3499	And he took his brethren with
c3500	him, and pursued after him seven days' journey;
c3501	and they overtook him in the mount Gilead.
c3502	And God came to Laban the Syrian in a dream by night,
c3503	and said
c3504	unto him, Take heed
c3505	that thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad.
c3506	Then Laban overtook Jacob.
c3507	Now Jacob had pitched his tent in the mount:
c3508	and Laban with his brethren pitched in the mount of Gilead.
c3509	And Laban said to Jacob,
c3510	What hast thou done,
c3511	that thou hast stolen away unawares
c3512	to me, and carried away my daughters, as captives <i>taken</i> with the sword?
c3513	Wherefore didst thou flee away secretly,
c3515	and steal away
c3516	from me; and didst not tell
c3517	me, that I might have sent thee away with mirth, and with songs, with tabret, and with harp?
c3518	And hast not suffered
c3519	me to kiss my sons and my daughters?
c3520	thou hast now done foolishly
c3521	in <i>so</i> doing.
c3522	It is in the power of my hand
c3523	to do you hurt: but the God of your father spake unto me yesternight,
c3525	saying,
c3526	Take thou heed
c3527	that thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad.
c3528	And now,
c3529	<i>though</i> thou wouldest needs be gone,
c3530	because thou sore longedst after thy father's house,
c3531	<i>yet</i> wherefore hast thou stolen my gods?
c3532	And Jacob answered
c3533	and said to Laban,
c3534	Because I was afraid:
c3535	for I said,
c3536	Peradventure thou wouldest take by force thy daughters from me.
c3537	With whomsoever thou findest thy gods,
c3538	let him not live: before our brethren
c3539	discern
c3540	thou what <i>is</i> thine with
c3541	me, and take
c3542	<i>it</i> to thee. For Jacob knew not
c3543	that Rachel had stolen them.
c3544	And Laban went into Jacob's tent, and into Leah's tent, and into the two maidservants' tents;
c3545	but he found <i>them</i> not.
c3546	Then went he out of Leah's tent,
c3547	and entered into Rachel's tent.
c3548	Now Rachel had taken the images,
c3549	and put them in the camel's furniture,
c3550	and sat upon
c3551	them. And Laban searched all the tent,
c3552	but found <i>them</i> not.
c3553	And she said to her father,
c3554	Let it not displease my lord
c3555	that I cannot
c3556	rise up before
c3557	thee; for the custom of women
c3558	<i>is</i> upon me. And he searched,
c3559	but found not the images.
c3560	And Jacob was wroth,
c3561	and chode with Laban:
c3562	and Jacob answered
c3563	and said to Laban,
c3564	What <i>is</i> my trespass?
c3565	what <i>is</i> my sin,
c3566	that thou hast so hotly pursued after me?
c3567	Whereas thou hast searched all my stuff,
c3568	what hast thou found of all thy household stuff?
c3569	set <i>it</i> here before my brethren and thy brethren,
c3570	that they may judge betwixt us both.
c3571	This twenty years <i>have</i> I <i>been</i> with
c3572	thee; thy ewes and thy she goats have not cast their young,
c3573	and the rams of thy flock have I not eaten.
c3574	That which was torn <i>of beasts</i> I brought not unto
c3575	thee; I bare the loss
c3576	of it; of my hand didst thou require it, <i>whether</i> stolen by day, or stolen by night.
c3577	<i>Thus</i> I was;
c3578	in the day the drought consumed
c3579	me, and the frost by night;
c3580	and my sleep departed from mine eyes.
c3581	Thus
c3582	have I been twenty years in thy house;
c3583	I served thee fourteen years for thy two daughters,
c3584	and six years for thy cattle:
c3585	and thou hast changed my wages ten times.
c3586	Except the God of my father, the God of Abraham, and the fear of Isaac, had been
c3587	with me, surely thou hadst sent me away now empty.
c3588	God hath seen mine affliction and the labour of my hands,
c3589	and rebuked <i>thee</i> yesternight.
c3590	And Laban answered
c3591	and said unto Jacob,
c3592	<i>These</i> daughters <i>are</i> my daughters,
c3593	and <i>these</i> children <i>are</i> my children,
c3594	and <i>these</i> cattle <i>are</i> my cattle,
c3595	and all
c3596	that thou seest
c3598	my daughters,
c3599	<i>is</i> mine: and what can I do this day unto these
c3600	or unto their children
c3601	which they have born?
c3602	Now therefore come
c3603	thou, let us make a covenant, I and thou;
c3604	and let it be for a witness between me and thee.
c3605	And Jacob took a stone,
c3606	and set it up <i>for</i> a pillar.
c3607	And Jacob said unto his brethren,
c3608	Gather stones;
c3609	and they took stones,
c3610	and made an heap:
c3611	and they did eat there upon the heap.
c3612	And Laban called it Jegarsahadutha:
c3613	but Jacob called it Galeed.
c3614	And Laban said,
c3615	This heap <i>is</i> a witness between me and thee this day.
c3616	Therefore was the name of it called Galeed;
c3617	And Mizpah;
c3618	for he said,
c3619	The LORD watch between
c3620	me and thee, when we are absent
c3621	one from another.
c3622	If thou shalt afflict my daughters,
c3623	or if thou shalt take <i>other</i> wives beside my daughters,
c3624	no man <i>is</i> with
c3625	us; see,
c3626	God <i>is</i> witness betwixt me and thee.
c3627	And Laban said to Jacob,
c3628	Behold this heap,
c3629	and behold <i>this</i> pillar,
c3630	which I have cast betwixt me and thee;
c3631	This heap <i>be</i> witness,
c3632	and <i>this</i> pillar <i>be</i> witness,
c3633	that I will not pass over this heap to
c3634	thee, and that thou shalt not pass over this heap and this pillar unto me, for harm.
c3635	The God of Abraham, and the God of Nahor, the God of their father, judge betwixt
c3636	us. And Jacob sware by the fear of his father Isaac.
c3637	Then Jacob offered sacrifice upon the mount,
c3638	and called his brethren
c3639	to eat bread:
c3640	and they did eat bread,
c3641	and tarried all night in the mount.
c3642	And early in the morning Laban rose up,
c3643	and kissed his sons and his daughters,
c3644	and blessed
c3646	them: and Laban departed, and returned unto his place.
c3647	And Jacob went on his way,
c3648	and the angels of God met him.
c3649	them, he said,
c3650	And when Jacob saw
c3651	This <i>is</i> God's host:
c3652	and he called the name of that place Mahanaim.
c3653	And Jacob sent messengers before him to Esau his brother unto the land of Seir, the country of Edom.
c3654	And he commanded
c3655	them, saying,
c3656	Thus shall ye speak unto my lord Esau;
c3657	Thy servant Jacob saith thus,
c3658	I have sojourned with Laban,
c3659	and stayed there until now:
c3660	And I have oxen, and asses, flocks, and menservants, and womenservants:
c3661	and I have sent
c3662	to tell my lord,
c3663	that I may find grace in thy sight.
c3664	And the messengers returned to Jacob,
c3665	saying,
c3666	We came to thy brother Esau,
c3667	and also he cometh
c3668	to meet
c3669	thee, and four hundred men with him.
c3670	Then Jacob was greatly afraid
c3671	and distressed:
c3672	and he divided the people
c3673	that <i>was</i> with
c3674	him, and the flocks, and herds, and the camels, into two bands;
c3675	And said,
c3676	If Esau come to the one company,
c3677	and smite
c3678	it, then the other company which is left shall escape.
c3679	And Jacob said,
c3680	O God of my father Abraham, and God of my father Isaac, the LORD
c3681	which saidst unto
c3682	me, Return unto thy country, and to thy kindred,
c3683	and I will deal well with thee:
c3684	I am not worthy of the least of all the mercies, and of all the truth,
c3685	which thou hast shewed unto thy servant;
c3686	for with my staff I passed over this Jordan;
c3687	and now I am become two bands.
c3688	Deliver me, I pray thee, from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau:
c3689	for I fear
c3690	him, lest he will come
c3691	and smite me, <i>and</i> the mother with the children.
c3692	And thou saidst,
c3693	I will surely do thee good,
c3694	and make thy seed as the sand of the sea,
c3695	which cannot be numbered for multitude.
c3696	And he lodged there that same night;
c3697	and took
c3698	of that which came to his hand
c3699	a present for Esau his brother;
c3700	Two hundred she goats, and twenty he goats, two hundred ewes, and twenty rams,
c3701	Thirty milch camels with their colts, forty kine, and ten bulls, twenty she asses, and ten foals.
c3702	And he delivered <i>them</i> into the hand of his servants, every drove by themselves;
c3703	and said unto his servants,
c3704	Pass over before
c3705	me, and put a space betwixt drove and drove.
c3706	And he commanded the foremost,
c3707	saying,
c3708	When Esau my brother meeteth
c3709	thee, and asketh
c3710	thee, saying,
c3711	Whose <i>art</i> thou?
c3712	and whither goest
c3713	thou? and whose <i>are</i> these before thee?
c3714	Then thou shalt say,
c3715	<i>They be</i> thy servant Jacob's;
c3716	it <i>is</i> a present
c3717	sent unto my lord Esau:
c3718	and, behold, also he <i>is</i> behind us.
c3719	And so commanded he the second, and the third, and all
c3720	that followed the droves,
c3721	saying,
c3722	On this manner shall ye speak unto Esau,
c3723	when ye find him.
c3724	And say
c3725	ye moreover, Behold, thy servant Jacob <i>is</i> behind
c3726	us. For he said,
c3727	I will appease him with the present
c3728	that goeth before
c3729	me, and afterward I will see his face;
c3730	peradventure he will accept of me.
c3731	So went the present over before
c3732	him: and himself lodged that night in the company.
c3733	And he rose up that night,
c3734	and took his two wives, and his two womenservants, and his eleven sons,
c3735	and passed over the ford Jabbok.
c3736	And he took
c3737	them, and sent them over the brook,
c3738	and sent over
c3739	that he had.
c3740	And Jacob was left alone;
c3741	and there wrestled a man with
c3742	him until the breaking of the day.
c3743	And when he saw
c3744	that he prevailed not
c3745	against him, he touched the hollow of his thigh;
c3746	and the hollow of Jacob's thigh was out of joint,
c3747	as he wrestled with him.
c3748	And he said,
c3749	Let me go,
c3750	for the day breaketh.
c3751	And he said,
c3752	I will not let thee go,
c3753	except thou bless me.
c3754	And he said unto
c3755	him, What <i>is</i> thy name?
c3756	And he said,
c3757	Jacob.
c3758	And he said,
c3759	Thy name shall be called no more Jacob,
c3760	but Israel:
c3761	for as a prince hast thou power with God and with men,
c3762	and hast prevailed.
c3763	And Jacob asked
c3764	<i>him,</i> and said,
c3765	Tell <i>me,</i> I pray thee, thy name.
c3766	And he said,
c3767	Wherefore <i>is</i> it <i>that</i> thou dost ask after my name?
c3768	And he blessed him there.
c3769	And Jacob called the name of the place Peniel:
c3770	for I have seen God face to face,
c3771	and my life is preserved.
c3772	the sun rose
c3773	And as he passed over Penuel
c3774	upon him, and he halted upon his thigh.
c3775	Therefore the children of Israel eat not <i>of</i> the sinew which shrank,
c3776	which <i>is</i> upon the hollow of the thigh,
c3777	unto this day:
c3778	because he touched the hollow of Jacob's thigh in the sinew that shrank.
c3779	And Jacob lifted up his eyes,
c3780	and looked,
c3781	and, behold, Esau came,
c3782	and with him four hundred men.
c3783	And he divided the children unto Leah, and unto Rachel, and unto the two handmaids.
c3784	And he put the handmaids and their children foremost,
c3785	and Leah and her children after,
c3786	and Rachel and Joseph hindermost.
c3787	And he passed over before
c3788	them, and bowed himself to the ground seven times,
c3789	until he came near to his brother.
c3790	And Esau ran
c3791	to meet
c3792	him, and embraced
c3793	him, and fell on his neck,
c3794	and kissed
c3795	him: and they wept.
c3796	And he lifted up his eyes,
c3797	and saw the women and the children;
c3798	and said,
c3799	Who <i>are</i> those
c3800	with thee? And he said,
c3801	The children
c3802	which God hath graciously given thy servant.
c3803	Then the handmaidens came near, they and their children,
c3804	and they bowed themselves.
c3805	And Leah also with her children came near,
c3806	and bowed themselves:
c3807	and after came Joseph near and Rachel,
c3808	and they bowed themselves.
c3809	And he said,
c3810	What <i>meanest</i> thou by all this drove
c3811	which I met?
c3812	And he said,
c3813	<i>These are</i> to find grace in the sight of my lord.
c3814	And Esau said,
c3815	I have enough,
c3816	my brother;
c3817	keep
c3818	that thou hast unto thyself.
c3819	And Jacob said,
c3820	Nay, I pray thee,
c3821	if now I have found grace in thy sight,
c3822	then receive my present at my hand:
c3823	for therefore I have seen thy face,
c3824	as though I had seen the face of God,
c3825	and thou wast pleased with me.
c3826	Take, I pray thee, my blessing
c3827	that is brought
c3828	to thee; because God hath dealt graciously
c3829	with me, and because I have enough.
c3830	And he urged
c3831	him, and he took <i>it.</i>
c3832	And he said,
c3833	Let us take our journey,
c3834	and let us go,
c3835	and I will go before thee.
c3836	And he said unto
c3837	him, My lord knoweth
c3838	that the children <i>are</i> tender,
c3839	and the flocks and herds with young <i>are</i> with
c3840	me: and if men should overdrive them one day,
c3841	all the flock will die.
c3842	Let my lord, I pray thee, pass over before his servant:
c3843	and I will lead on softly, according as the cattle
c3844	that goeth before
c3845	me and the children be able to endure,
c3846	until I come unto my lord unto Seir.
c3847	And Esau said,
c3848	Let me now leave with thee <i>some</i> of the folk
c3849	that <i>are</i> with
c3850	me. And he said,
c3851	What needeth it? let me find grace in the sight of my lord.
c3852	So Esau returned that day on his way unto Seir.
c3853	And Jacob journeyed to Succoth,
c3854	and built him an house,
c3855	and made booths for his cattle:
c3856	therefore the name of the place is called Succoth.
c3857	And Jacob came to Shalem, a city of Shechem,
c3858	which <i>is</i> in the land of Canaan,
c3859	when he came from Padanaram;
c3860	and pitched his tent before the city.
c3861	And he bought a parcel of a field,
c3862	where he had spread his tent,
c3863	at the hand of the children of Hamor, Shechem's father, for an hundred pieces of money.
c3864	And he erected there an altar,
c3865	and called it Elelohe-Israel.
c3866	And Dinah the daughter of Leah, which she bare unto Jacob, went out
c3868	to see the daughters of the land.
c3869	And when Shechem the son of Hamor the Hivite, prince of the country, saw
c3870	her, he took
c3871	her, and lay with
c3872	her, and defiled her.
c3873	And his soul clave unto Dinah the daughter of Jacob,
c3874	and he loved the damsel,
c3875	and spake kindly unto the damsel.
c3876	And Shechem spake unto his father Hamor,
c3877	saying,
c3878	Get me this damsel to wife.
c3879	And Jacob heard
c3880	that he had defiled Dinah his daughter:
c3881	now his sons were with his cattle in the field:
c3882	and Jacob held his peace
c3883	until they were come.
c3884	And Hamor the father of Shechem went out unto Jacob
c3885	to commune with him.
c3886	And the sons of Jacob came out of the field
c3887	when they heard
c3888	<i>it:</i> and the men were grieved,
c3889	and they were very wroth,
c3890	because he had wrought folly in Israel
c3891	in lying with Jacob's daughter;
c3892	which thing ought not to be done.
c3893	And Hamor communed with
c3894	them, saying,
c3896	The soul of my son Shechem longeth for your daughter:
c3897	I pray you give her him to wife.
c3898	And make ye marriages with
c3899	us, <i>and</i> give your daughters
c3900	unto us, and take our daughters unto you.
c3901	And ye shall dwell with
c3902	us: and the land shall be before
c3903	you; dwell
c3904	and trade
c3905	ye therein, and get you possessions therein.
c3906	And Shechem said unto her father and unto her brethren,
c3907	Let me find grace in your eyes,
c3909	and what ye shall say unto
c3910	me I will give.
c3911	Ask me never so much dowry and gift,
c3912	and I will give
c3913	according as ye shall say unto
c3914	me: but give me the damsel to wife.
c3915	And the sons of Jacob answered Shechem and Hamor his father deceitfully,
c3916	and said,
c3917	because he had defiled Dinah their sister:
c3918	And they said unto
c3919	them, We cannot
c3920	do this thing,
c3921	to give our sister to one
c3922	that is uncircumcised;
c3923	for that <i>were</i> a reproach unto us:
c3924	But in this will we consent
c3925	unto you: If ye will be
c3926	as we <i>be,</i> that every male of you be circumcised;
c3927	Then will we give our daughters
c3928	unto you, and we will take your daughters
c3929	to us, and we will dwell with
c3930	you, and we will become one people.
c3931	But if ye will not hearken unto
c3932	us, to be circumcised;
c3933	then will we take our daughter,
c3934	and we will be gone.
c3935	And their words pleased Hamor, and Shechem Hamor's son.
c3936	And the young man deferred not
c3937	to do the thing,
c3938	because he had delight in Jacob's daughter:
c3939	and he <i>was</i> more honourable than all the house of his father.
c3940	And Hamor and Shechem his son came unto the gate of their city,
c3941	and communed with the men of their city,
c3942	saying,
c3943	These men
c3944	<i>are</i> peaceable with
c3945	us; therefore let them dwell in the land,
c3946	and trade
c3947	therein; for the land,
c3948	behold, <i>it is</i> large enough for
c3949	them; let us take their daughters to us for wives,
c3950	and let us give them our daughters.
c3951	Only herein will the men consent
c3952	unto us for to dwell with
c3953	us, to be one people,
c3954	if every male among us be circumcised,
c3955	as they <i>are</i> circumcised.
c3956	their cattle and their substance and every beast
c3957	<i>Shall</i> not
c3958	of theirs <i>be</i> ours? only let us consent
c3959	unto them, and they will dwell with us.
c3960	And unto Hamor and unto Shechem his son hearkened all that went out of the gate of his city;
c3961	and every male was circumcised, all that went out of the gate of his city.
c3962	And it came to pass on the third day,
c3963	when they were sore,
c3964	that two of the sons of Jacob, Simeon and Levi, Dinah's brethren, took
c3965	each man his sword,
c3966	and came upon the city boldly,
c3967	and slew all the males.
c3968	And they slew Hamor and Shechem his son with the edge of the sword,
c3969	and took Dinah out of Shechem's house,
c3970	and went out.
c3971	The sons of Jacob came upon the slain,
c3972	and spoiled the city,
c3973	because they had defiled their sister.
c3974	their sheep, and their oxen, and their asses,
c3975	and that which <i>was</i> in the city,
c3976	and that which <i>was</i> in the field,
c3977	They took
c3978	And all their wealth, and all their little ones, and their wives took they captive,
c3979	and spoiled
c3980	even all
c3981	that <i>was</i> in the house.
c3982	And Jacob said to Simeon and Levi,
c3983	Ye have troubled
c3984	me to make me to stink among the inhabitants of the land, among the Canaanites and the Perizzites:
c3985	and I <i>being</i> few in number,
c3986	they shall gather themselves together against
c3987	me, and slay
c3988	me; and I shall be destroyed, I and my house.
c3989	And they said,
c3990	Should he deal with our sister as with an harlot?
c3991	And God said unto Jacob,
c3992	Arise,
c3993	go up to Bethel,
c3994	and dwell there:
c3995	and make there an altar unto God,
c3996	that appeared unto
c3997	thee when thou fleddest from the face of Esau thy brother.
c3998	Then Jacob said unto his household, and to all
c3999	that <i>were</i> with
c4000	him, Put away the strange gods
c4001	that <i>are</i> among
c4002	you, and be clean,
c4003	and change your garments:
c4004	And let us arise,
c4005	and go up to Bethel;
c4006	and I will make there an altar unto God,
c4007	who answered me in the day of my distress,
c4008	and was with me in the way
c4009	which I went.
c4010	And they gave unto Jacob all the strange gods
c4011	which <i>were</i> in their hand,
c4012	and <i>all their</i> earrings
c4013	which <i>were</i> in their ears;
c4014	and Jacob hid them under the oak
c4015	which <i>was</i> by Shechem.
c4016	And they journeyed:
c4017	and the terror of God was upon the cities
c4018	that <i>were</i> round about
c4019	them, and they did not pursue after the sons of Jacob.
c4020	So Jacob came to Luz,
c4021	which <i>is</i> in the land of Canaan,
c4022	that <i>is,</i> Bethel,
c4023	he and all the people
c4024	that <i>were</i> with him.
c4025	And he built there an altar,
c4026	and called the place Elbethel:
c4027	because there God appeared unto
c4028	him, when he fled from the face of his brother.
c4029	But Deborah Rebekah's nurse died,
c4030	and she was buried beneath Bethel under an oak:
c4031	and the name of it was called Allonbachuth.
c4032	And God appeared unto Jacob again,
c4033	when he came out of Padanaram,
c4034	and blessed him.
c4035	And God said
c4036	unto him, Thy name <i>is</i> Jacob:
c4037	thy name shall not be called any more Jacob,
c4038	but Israel shall be thy name:
c4039	and he called his name Israel.
c4040	And God said
c4041	unto him, I <i>am</i> God Almighty:
c4042	be fruitful
c4043	and multiply;
c4044	a nation and a company of nations shall be of
c4045	thee, and kings shall come out of thy loins;
c4046	And the land
c4047	which I gave Abraham and Isaac,
c4048	to thee I will give
c4049	it, and to thy seed after thee will I give the land.
c4050	And God went up from him in the place
c4051	where he talked with him.
c4052	And Jacob set up a pillar in the place
c4053	where he talked with
c4054	him, <i>even</i> a pillar of stone:
c4055	and he poured a drink offering thereon,
c4056	and he poured oil thereon.
c4057	And Jacob called the name of the place
c4058	where God spake with
c4059	him, Bethel.
c4060	And they journeyed from Bethel;
c4061	and there was but a little way
c4062	to come to Ephrath:
c4063	and Rachel travailed,
c4064	and she had hard
c4065	labour.
c4066	And it came to pass,
c4067	when she was in hard
c4068	labour,
c4069	that the midwife said
c4070	unto her, Fear not;
c4071	thou shalt have this son also.
c4072	And it came to pass,
c4073	as her soul was in departing,
c4074	(for she died)
c4075	that she called his name Benoni:
c4076	but his father called him Benjamin.
c4077	And Rachel died,
c4078	and was buried in the way to Ephrath,
c4079	which <i>is</i> Bethlehem.
c4080	And Jacob set a pillar upon her grave:
c4081	that <i>is</i> the pillar of Rachel's grave unto this day.
c4082	And Israel journeyed,
c4083	and spread his tent beyond the tower of Edar.
c4084	And it came to pass,
c4085	when Israel dwelt in that land,
c4086	that Reuben went
c4087	and lay with Bilhah his father's concubine:
c4088	and Israel heard
c4089	<i>it.</i> Now the sons of Jacob were twelve:
c4090	The sons of Leah; Reuben, Jacob's firstborn, and Simeon, and Levi, and Judah, and Issachar, and Zebulun:
c4091	The sons of Rachel; Joseph, and Benjamin:
c4092	And the sons of Bilhah, Rachel's handmaid; Dan, and Naphtali:
c4093	And the sons of Zilpah, Leah's handmaid; Gad, and Asher:
c4094	these <i>are</i> the sons of Jacob,
c4095	which were born to him in Padanaram.
c4096	And Jacob came unto Isaac his father unto Mamre, unto the city of Arbah,
c4097	which <i>is</i> Hebron,
c4098	where Abraham and Isaac sojourned.
c4099	And the days of Isaac were an hundred and fourscore years.
c4100	And Isaac gave up the ghost,
c4101	and died,
c4102	and was gathered unto his people, <i>being</i> old and full of days:
c4103	and his sons Esau and Jacob buried him.
c4104	Now these <i>are</i> the generations of Esau,
c4105	who <i>is</i> Edom.
c4106	Esau took his wives of the daughters of Canaan;
c4107	Adah the daughter of Elon the Hittite, and Aholibamah the daughter of Anah the daughter of Zibeon the Hivite;
c4108	And Bashemath Ishmael's daughter, sister of Nebajoth.
c4109	And Adah bare to Esau Eliphaz;
c4110	and Bashemath bare Reuel;
c4111	And Aholibamah bare Jeush, and Jaalam, and Korah:
c4112	these <i>are</i> the sons of Esau,
c4113	which were born unto him in the land of Canaan.
c4114	And Esau took his wives, and his sons, and his daughters, and all the persons of his house, and his cattle, and all his beasts, and all his substance,
c4115	which he had got in the land of Canaan;
c4116	and went into the country from the face of his brother Jacob.
c4117	For their riches were more than
c4118	that they might dwell together;
c4119	and the land wherein they were strangers could not
c4120	bear
c4121	them because of their cattle.
c4122	Thus dwelt Esau in mount Seir:

c4205	these <i>be</i> the dukes of Edom, according to their habitations in the land of their possession:
c4206	he <i>is</i> Esau the father of the Edomites.
c4207	And Jacob dwelt in the land wherein his father was a stranger, in the land of Canaan.
c4208	These <i>are</i> the generations of Jacob.
c4209	Joseph, <i>being</i> seventeen years old, was
c4210	feeding the flock with his brethren;
c4211	and the lad <i>was</i> with the sons of Bilhah, and with the sons of Zilpah, his father's wives:
c4212	and Joseph brought unto his father their evil report.
c4213	Now Israel loved Joseph more than all his children,
c4214	because he <i>was</i> the son of his old age:
c4215	and he made him a coat of <i>many</i> colours.
c4216	And when his brethren saw
c4217	that their father loved him more than all his brethren,
c4218	they hated
c4219	him, and could not
c4220	speak peaceably unto him.
c4221	And Joseph dreamed a dream,
c4222	and he told <i>it</i> his brethren:
c4223	him yet the more.
c4224	and they hated
c4225	And he said unto
c4226	them, Hear, I pray you, this dream which I have dreamed:
c4228	For, behold, we <i>were</i> binding sheaves in the field,
c4229	and, lo, my sheaf arose,
c4230	and also stood upright;
c4231	and, behold, your sheaves stood round about,
c4232	and made obeisance to my sheaf.
c4233	And his brethren said
c4234	to him, Shalt thou indeed reign over
c4235	us? or shalt thou indeed have dominion
c4237	over us? And they hated him yet the more for his dreams, and for his words.
c4238	And he dreamed yet another dream,
c4239	and told it his brethren,
c4240	and said,
c4241	Behold, I have dreamed a dream more;
c4242	and, behold, the sun and the moon and the eleven stars made obeisance to me.
c4243	And he told <i>it</i> to his father, and to his brethren:
c4244	and his father rebuked
c4245	him, and said
c4246	unto him, What <i>is</i> this dream
c4247	that thou hast dreamed?
c4248	Shall I and thy mother and thy brethren indeed come
c4249	to bow down ourselves to thee to the earth?
c4250	And his brethren envied
c4251	him; but his father observed the saying.
c4252	And his brethren went
c4253	to feed their father's flock in Shechem.
c4254	And Israel said unto Joseph,
c4255	Do not thy brethren feed <i>the flock</i> in Shechem?
c4256	come,
c4257	and I will send thee unto
c4258	them. And he said
c4259	to him, Here <i>am I.</i>
c4260	And he said
c4261	to him, Go, I pray thee,
c4262	see whether it be well with thy brethren, and well with the flocks;
c4263	and bring me word
c4264	again. So he sent him out of the vale of Hebron,
c4265	and he came to Shechem.
c4266	And a certain man found
c4267	him, and, behold, <i>he was</i> wandering in the field:
c4268	and the man asked
c4269	him, saying,
c4270	What seekest thou?
c4271	And he said,
c4272	I seek my brethren:
c4273	tell me, I pray thee,
c4274	where they feed <i>their flocks.</i>
c4275	And the man said,
c4276	They are departed hence;
c4277	for I heard
c4278	them say,
c4279	Let us go to Dothan.
c4280	And Joseph went after his brethren,
c4281	and found them in Dothan.
c4282	And when they saw him afar off,
c4283	even before he came near unto
c4284	them, they conspired
c4285	against him to slay him.
c4286	And they said
c4287	one to another,
c4288	Behold, this dreamer cometh.
c4289	now
c4290	Come
c4291	therefore, and let us slay
c4292	him, and cast him into some pit,
c4293	and we will say,
c4294	Some evil beast hath devoured
c4295	him: and we shall see
c4296	what will become of his dreams.
c4297	And Reuben heard
c4298	<i>it,</i> and he delivered him out of their hands;
c4299	and said,
c4300	Let us not kill him.
c4301	And Reuben said unto
c4302	them, Shed no blood, <i>but</i> cast him into this pit
c4304	that <i>is</i> in the wilderness,
c4305	and lay no hand
c4306	upon him; that he might rid him out of their hands,
c4307	to deliver him to his father again.
c4308	And it came to pass,
c4309	when Joseph was come unto his brethren,
c4310	that they stript Joseph out of his coat, <i>his</i> coat of <i>many</i> colours
c4311	that <i>was</i> on him;
c4312	And they took
c4313	him, and cast him into a pit:
c4314	and the pit <i>was</i> empty,
c4315	<i>there was</i> no water in it.
c4316	And they sat down
c4317	to eat bread:
c4318	and they lifted up their eyes
c4319	and looked,
c4320	and, behold, a company of Ishmeelites came from Gilead
c4321	with their camels bearing spicery and balm and myrrh,
c4322	going
c4323	to carry <i>it</i> down to Egypt.
c4324	And Judah said unto his brethren,
c4325	What profit
c4326	<i>is it</i> if we slay our brother,
c4327	and conceal his blood?
c4328	Come,
c4329	and let us sell him to the Ishmeelites,
c4330	and let not our hand be
c4331	upon him; for he <i>is</i> our brother <i>and</i> our flesh.
c4332	And his brethren were content.
c4333	Then there passed by Midianites
c4334	merchantmen;
c4335	and they drew
c4336	and lifted up Joseph out of the pit,
c4337	and sold Joseph to the Ishmeelites for twenty <i>pieces</i> of silver:
c4338	and they brought Joseph into Egypt.
c4339	And Reuben returned unto the pit;
c4340	and, behold, Joseph <i>was</i> not in the pit;
c4341	and he rent his clothes.
c4342	And he returned unto his brethren,
c4343	and said,
c4344	The child
c4345	<i>is</i> not;
c4346	and I,
c4347	whither shall I go?
c4348	And they took Joseph's coat,
c4349	and killed a kid of the goats,
c4350	and dipped the coat in the blood;
c4351	And they sent the coat of <i>many</i> colours,
c4352	and they brought <i>it</i> to their father;
c4353	and said,
c4354	This have we found:
c4355	know now
c4356	whether it <i>be</i> thy son's coat
c4357	or no.
c4358	And he knew
c4359	it, and said,
c4360	<i>It is</i> my son's coat;
c4361	an evil beast hath devoured
c4362	him; Joseph is without doubt rent in pieces.
c4363	And Jacob rent his clothes,
c4364	and put sackcloth upon his loins,
c4365	and mourned for his son many days.
c4366	And all his sons and all his daughters rose up
c4367	to comfort
c4368	him; but he refused
c4369	to be comforted;
c4370	and he said,
c4371	For I will go down into the grave unto my son
c4372	mourning.
c4373	Thus his father wept for him.
c4374	And the Midianites sold him into Egypt unto Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh's, <i>and</i> captain of the guard.
c4375	And it came to pass at that time,
c4376	that Judah went down from his brethren,
c4377	and turned in to a certain Adullamite,
c4378	whose name <i>was</i> Hirah.
c4379	And Judah saw there a daughter of a certain Canaanite,
c4380	whose name <i>was</i> Shuah;
c4381	and he took
c4382	her, and went in unto her.
c4383	And she conceived,
c4384	and bare a son;
c4385	and he called his name Er.
c4386	And she conceived again,
c4387	and bare a son;
c4388	and she called his name Onan.
c4389	And she yet again conceived,
c4390	and bare a son;
c4391	and called his name Shelah:
c4392	and he was at Chezib,
c4393	when she bare him.
c4394	And Judah took a wife for Er his firstborn,
c4395	whose name <i>was</i> Tamar.
c4396	And Er, Judah's firstborn, was wicked in the sight of the LORD;
c4397	and the LORD slew him.
c4398	And Judah said unto Onan,
c4399	Go in unto thy brother's wife,
c4400	and marry
c4401	her, and raise up seed to thy brother.
c4402	And Onan knew
c4403	that the seed should not be
c4404	his; and it came to pass,
c4405	when he went in unto his brother's wife,
c4406	that he spilled <i>it</i> on the ground,
c4407	lest that he should give seed to his brother.
c4408	displeased the LORD:
c4409	And the thing which he did
c4410	wherefore he slew him also.
c4411	Then said Judah to Tamar his daughter in law,
c4412	Remain a widow at thy father's house,
c4413	till Shelah my son be grown:
c4414	for he said,
c4415	Lest peradventure he die also, as his brethren
c4416	<i>did.</i> And Tamar went
c4417	and dwelt in her father's house.
c4418	And in process of time
c4419	the daughter of Shuah Judah's wife died;
c4420	and Judah was comforted,
c4421	and went up unto his sheepshearers to Timnath, he and his friend Hirah the Adullamite.
c4422	And it was told Tamar,
c4423	saying,
c4424	Behold thy father in law goeth up to Timnath
c4425	to shear his sheep.
c4426	And she put her widow's garments off from
c4427	her, and covered her with a vail,
c4428	and wrapped herself,
c4429	and sat in an open place,
c4430	which <i>is</i> by the way to Timnath;
c4431	for she saw
c4432	that Shelah was grown,
c4433	and she was not given unto him to wife.
c4434	When Judah saw
c4435	her, he thought her <i>to be</i> an harlot;
c4436	because she had covered her face.
c4437	And he turned unto her by the way,
c4438	and said,
c4439	Go to, I pray thee,
c4440	let me come in unto
c4441	thee; (for he knew not
c4442	that she <i>was</i> his daughter in law.)
c4443	And she said,
c4444	What wilt thou give
c4445	me, that thou mayest come in unto me?
c4446	And he said,
c4447	I will send <i>thee</i> a kid from the flock.
c4448	And she said,
c4449	Wilt thou give <i>me</i> a pledge,
c4450	till thou send <i>it?</i>
c4451	And he said,
c4452	What pledge
c4453	shall I give thee? And she said,
c4455	Thy signet, and thy bracelets, and thy staff that
c4456	<i>is</i> in thine hand.
c4457	And he gave
c4458	<i>it</i> her, and came in unto
c4459	her, and she conceived by him.
c4460	And she arose,
c4461	and went away,
c4462	and laid by her vail from
c4463	her, and put on the garments of her widowhood.
c4464	And Judah sent the kid by the hand of his friend the Adullamite,
c4465	to receive <i>his</i> pledge from the woman's hand:
c4466	but he found her not.
c4467	Then he asked the men of that place,
c4468	saying,
c4469	Where <i>is</i> the harlot,
c4470	that <i>was</i> openly by the way side?
c4471	And they said,
c4472	There was no harlot in this <i>place.</i>
c4473	And he returned to Judah,
c4474	and said,
c4475	I cannot find
c4476	her; and also the men of the place said,
c4477	<i>that</i> there was no harlot in this <i>place.</i>
c4478	And Judah said,
c4479	Let her take
c4480	<i>it</i> to her, lest we be shamed:
c4481	behold, I sent this kid,
c4482	and thou hast not found her.
c4483	And it came to pass about three months
c4484	after, that it was told Judah,
c4485	saying,
c4486	Tamar thy daughter in law hath played the harlot;
c4487	and also, behold, she <i>is</i> with child by whoredom.
c4488	And Judah said,
c4489	Bring her forth,
c4490	and let her be burnt.
c4491	When she <i>was</i> brought forth,
c4492	she sent to her father in law,
c4493	saying,
c4494	By the man,
c4495	whose these
c4496	<i>are, am</i> I with child:
c4497	and she said,
c4498	Discern, I pray thee,
c4499	whose <i>are</i> these, the signet, and bracelets, and staff.
c4500	And Judah acknowledged
c4501	<i>them,</i> and said,
c4502	She hath been more righteous than
c4503	I; because that I gave her not to Shelah my son.
c4504	her again no more.
c4505	And he knew
c4506	And it came to pass
c4507	in the time of her travail,
c4508	that, behold, twins <i>were</i> in her womb.
c4509	And it came to pass,
c4510	when she travailed,
c4511	that <i>the one</i> put out <i>his</i> hand:
c4512	and the midwife took
c4513	and bound upon his hand a scarlet thread,
c4514	saying,
c4515	This came out first.
c4516	And it came to pass,
c4517	as he drew back his hand,
c4518	that, behold, his brother came out:
c4519	and she said,
c4520	How hast thou broken forth? <i>this</i> breach <i>be</i> upon
c4521	thee: therefore his name was called Pharez.
c4522	And afterward came out his brother,
c4523	that had the scarlet thread upon his hand:
c4524	and his name was called Zarah.
c4525	And Joseph was brought down to Egypt;
c4526	and Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh, captain of the guard, an Egyptian, bought him of the hands of the Ishmeelites,
c4527	which had brought him down thither.
c4528	And the LORD was with Joseph,
c4529	and he was a prosperous man;
c4530	and he was in the house of his master the Egyptian.
c4531	And his master saw
c4532	that the LORD <i>was</i> with
c4534	that he did to prosper in his hand.
c4535	him, and that the LORD made all
c4536	And Joseph found grace in his sight,
c4537	and he served
c4538	him: and he made him overseer over his house,
c4539	and all
c4540	<i>that</i> he had
c4541	he put into his hand.
c4542	And it came to pass
c4543	from the time <i>that</i> he had made him overseer in his house, and over all
c4544	that he had,
c4545	that the LORD blessed the Egyptian's house for Joseph's sake;
c4546	and the blessing of the LORD was upon all
c4547	that he had in the house, and in the field.
c4548	And he left all
c4549	that
c4550	he had in Joseph's hand;
c4551	and he knew not ought he had,
c4552	save the bread
c4553	which he did eat.
c4554	And Joseph was <i>a</i> goodly <i>person,</i> and well favoured.
c4555	And it came to pass after these things,
c4556	that his master's wife cast her eyes upon Joseph;
c4557	and she said,
c4558	Lie with me.
c4559	But he refused,
c4560	and said unto his master's wife,
c4561	Behold, my master wotteth not what <i>is</i> with
c4562	me in the house,
c4564	that he hath to my hand;
c4565	and he hath committed all
c4566	<i>There is</i> none greater in this house than
c4567	I; neither hath he kept back any thing from
c4568	me but
c4569	thee, because thou <i>art</i> his wife:
c4570	how then can I do this great wickedness,
c4571	and sin against God?
c4572	And it came to pass,
c4573	as she spake to Joseph day by day,
c4574	that he hearkened not unto
c4575	her, to lie by
c4576	her, <i>or</i> to be with her.
c4577	And it came to pass about this time,
c4578	that <i>Joseph</i> went into the house
c4579	to do his business;
c4580	and <i>there was</i> none of the men of the house there within.
c4581	And she caught him by his garment,
c4582	saying,
c4583	Lie with
c4584	me: and he left his garment in her hand,
c4585	and fled,
c4586	and got him out.
c4587	And it came to pass,
c4588	when she saw
c4589	that he had left his garment in her hand,
c4590	and was fled forth,
c4591	That she called unto the men of her house,
c4592	and spake
c4593	unto them, saying,
c4594	See,
c4595	he hath brought in an Hebrew
c4596	unto us to mock
c4597	us; he came in unto
c4598	me to lie with
c4599	me, and I cried with a loud voice:
c4600	And it came to pass,
c4601	when he heard
c4602	that I lifted up my voice
c4603	and cried,
c4604	that he left his garment with
c4605	me, and fled,
c4606	and got him out.
c4607	And she laid up his garment by
c4608	her, until his lord came home.
c4609	And she spake unto him according to these words,
c4610	saying,
c4611	The Hebrew servant, which thou hast brought unto us, came in unto
c4613	me to mock me:
c4614	And it came to pass,
c4615	as I lifted up my voice
c4616	and cried,
c4617	that he left his garment with
c4618	me, and fled out.
c4619	And it came to pass,
c4620	when his master heard the words of his wife,
c4621	which she spake unto
c4622	him, saying,
c4623	After this manner did thy servant
c4624	to me; that his wrath was kindled.
c4625	And Joseph's master took
c4626	him, and put him into the prison, a place
c4627	where the king's prisoners <i>were</i> bound:
c4628	and he was there in the prison.
c4629	But the LORD was with Joseph,
c4630	and shewed him mercy,
c4631	and gave him favour in the sight of the keeper of the prison.
c4632	And the keeper of the prison committed to Joseph's hand all the prisoners
c4633	that <i>were</i> in the prison;
c4634	and whatsoever
c4635	they did there,
c4636	he was the doer <i>of it.</i>
c4637	The keeper of the prison looked not to any thing <i>that was</i> under his hand;
c4638	because the LORD was with
c4640	him, and <i>that</i> which he did,
c4641	the LORD made <i>it</i> to prosper.
c4642	And it came to pass after these things,
c4643	<i>that</i> the butler of the king of Egypt and <i>his</i> baker had offended their lord the king of Egypt.
c4644	And Pharaoh was wroth against two <i>of</i> his officers, against the chief of the butlers, and against the chief of the bakers.
c4645	And he put them in ward in the house of the captain of the guard, into the prison, the place
c4646	where Joseph <i>was</i> bound.
c4647	And the captain of the guard charged Joseph with
c4648	them, and he served
c4649	them: and they continued a season in ward.
c4650	And they dreamed a dream both
c4651	of them, each man his dream in one night,
c4652	each man according to the interpretation of his dream,
c4653	the butler and the baker
c4654	of the king of Egypt, which
c4655	<i>were</i> bound in the prison.
c4656	And Joseph came in unto them in the morning,
c4657	and looked upon
c4658	them, and, behold, they <i>were</i> sad.
c4659	And he asked Pharaoh's officers
c4660	that <i>were</i> with him in the ward of his lord's house,
c4661	saying,
c4662	Wherefore look ye <i>so</i> sadly to day?
c4663	And they said unto
c4664	him, We have dreamed a dream,
c4665	and <i>there is</i> no interpreter
c4666	of it. And Joseph said unto
c4667	them, <i>Do</i> not interpretations <i>belong</i> to God?
c4668	tell me <i>them,</i> I pray you.
c4669	And the chief butler told his dream to Joseph,
c4670	and said
c4671	to him, In my dream,
c4672	behold, a vine <i>was</i> before me;
c4673	And in the vine <i>were</i> three branches:
c4675	and it <i>was</i> as though it budded, <i>and</i> her blossoms shot forth;
c4676	and the clusters thereof brought forth ripe grapes:
c4677	And Pharaoh's cup <i>was</i> in my hand:
c4678	and I took the grapes,
c4679	and pressed them into Pharaoh's cup,
c4680	and I gave the cup into Pharaoh's hand.
c4681	And Joseph said
c4682	unto him, This <i>is</i> the interpretation
c4683	of it: The three branches
c4684	<i>are</i> three days:
c4685	Yet within three days shall Pharaoh lift up thine head,
c4686	and restore thee unto thy place:
c4687	and thou shalt deliver Pharaoh's cup into his hand, after the former manner
c4688	when thou wast his butler.
c4689	But think on
c4690	me when it shall be well
c4691	with thee, and shew kindness, I pray thee, unto
c4692	me, and make mention of me unto Pharaoh,
c4693	and bring me out of this house:
c4694	For indeed I was stolen away out of the land of the Hebrews:
c4695	and here also have I done nothing
c4696	that they should put me into the dungeon.
c4697	When the chief baker saw
c4698	that the interpretation was good,
c4699	he said unto Joseph,
c4700	I also
c4701	<i>was</i> in my dream,
c4702	and, behold, <i>I had</i> three white baskets on my head:
c4703	And in the uppermost basket <i>there was</i> of all manner of bakemeats for Pharaoh;
c4704	and the birds did eat them out of the basket upon my head.
c4705	And Joseph answered
c4706	and said,
c4707	This <i>is</i> the interpretation
c4708	thereof: The three baskets
c4709	<i>are</i> three days:
c4710	Yet within three days shall Pharaoh lift up thy head from off
c4711	thee, and shall hang thee on a tree;
c4712	and the birds shall eat thy flesh from off thee.
c4713	And it came to pass the third day, <i>which was</i> Pharaoh's birthday,
c4715	that he made a feast unto all his servants:
c4716	and he lifted up the head of the chief butler and of the chief baker among his servants.
c4717	And he restored the chief butler unto his butlership
c4718	again; and he gave the cup into Pharaoh's hand:
c4719	But he hanged the chief baker:
c4720	as Joseph had interpreted to them.
c4721	Yet did not the chief butler remember Joseph,
c4722	but forgat him.
c4723	And it came to pass at the end of two full years,
c4724	that Pharaoh dreamed:
c4725	and, behold, he stood by the river.
c4726	And, behold, there came up out of the river seven well favoured kine and fatfleshed;
c4727	and they fed in a meadow.
c4728	And, behold, seven other kine came up after them out of the river, ill favoured and leanfleshed;
c4729	and stood by the <i>other</i> kine upon the brink of the river.
c4730	And the ill favoured and leanfleshed kine did eat up the seven well favoured and fat kine.
c4731	So Pharaoh awoke.
c4732	And he slept
c4733	and dreamed the second time:
c4734	and, behold, seven ears of corn came up upon one stalk, rank and good.
c4735	And, behold, seven thin ears and blasted with the east wind sprung up after them.
c4736	And the seven thin ears devoured the seven rank and full ears.
c4737	And Pharaoh awoke,
c4738	and, behold, <i>it was</i> a dream.
c4739	And it came to pass in the morning
c4740	that his spirit was troubled;
c4741	and he sent
c4742	and called for all the magicians of Egypt, and all the wise men
c4743	thereof: and Pharaoh told them his dream;
c4744	but <i>there was</i> none
c4745	that could interpret them unto Pharaoh.
c4746	Then spake the chief butler unto Pharaoh,
c4747	saying,
c4748	I do remember my faults this day:
c4749	Pharaoh was wroth with his servants,
c4750	and put me in ward in the captain of the guard's house, <i>both</i> me and the chief baker:
c4751	And we dreamed a dream in one night, I and he;
c4752	each man according to the interpretation of his dream.
c4753	we dreamed
c4754	And <i>there was</i> there with us a young man, an Hebrew, servant to the captain of the guard;
c4755	and we told
c4756	him, and he interpreted to us our dreams;
c4757	to each man according to his dream he did interpret.
c4758	And it came to pass,
c4759	as he interpreted
c4760	to us, so it was;
c4761	me he restored unto mine office,
c4762	and him he hanged.
c4763	Then Pharaoh sent
c4764	and called Joseph,
c4765	and they brought him hastily out of the dungeon:
c4766	and he shaved
c4767	<i>himself,</i> and changed his raiment,
c4768	and came in unto Pharaoh.
c4769	And Pharaoh said unto Joseph,
c4770	I have dreamed a dream,
c4771	and <i>there is</i> none that can interpret
c4772	it: and I have heard say of
c4774	thee, <i>that</i> thou canst understand a dream
c4775	to interpret it.
c4776	And Joseph answered Pharaoh,
c4777	saying,
c4778	<i>It is</i> not in
c4779	me: God shall give Pharaoh an answer of peace.
c4780	And Pharaoh said unto Joseph,
c4781	In my dream,
c4782	behold, I stood upon the bank of the river:
c4783	And, behold, there came up out of the river seven kine, fatfleshed and well favoured;
c4784	and they fed in a meadow:
c4785	And, behold, seven other kine came up after them, poor and very ill favoured and leanfleshed,
c4786	such as I never saw in all the land of Egypt for badness:
c4787	And the lean and the ill favoured kine did eat up the first seven fat kine:
c4788	And when they had eaten them up,
c4789	it could not be known
c4790	that they had eaten
c4791	them; but they <i>were</i> still ill favoured,
c4792	as at the beginning.
c4793	So I awoke.
c4794	And I saw in my dream,
c4795	and, behold, seven ears came up in one stalk, full and good:
c4796	And, behold, seven ears, withered, thin, <i>and</i> blasted with the east wind, sprung up after them:
c4797	And the thin ears devoured the seven good ears:
c4798	and I told <i>this</i> unto the magicians;
c4799	but <i>there was</i> none
c4800	that could declare <i>it</i> to me.
c4801	And Joseph said unto Pharaoh,
c4802	The dream of Pharaoh
c4803	<i>is</i> one:
c4804	God hath shewed Pharaoh what he <i>is</i> about to do.
c4806	The seven good kine
c4807	<i>are</i> seven years;
c4808	and the seven good ears
c4809	<i>are</i> seven years:
c4810	the dream <i>is</i> one.
c4811	And the seven thin and ill favoured kine
c4812	that came up after
c4813	them <i>are</i> seven years;
c4814	and the seven empty ears blasted with the east wind
c4815	shall be seven years of famine.
c4816	This <i>is</i> the thing
c4817	which I have spoken unto Pharaoh:
c4818	What God <i>is</i> about to do
c4819	he sheweth unto Pharaoh.
c4820	Behold, there come seven years
c4821	of great plenty throughout all the land of Egypt:
c4822	And there shall arise after them seven years of famine;
c4823	and all the plenty shall be forgotten in the land of Egypt;
c4824	and the famine shall consume the land;
c4825	And the plenty shall not be known in the land by reason of that famine following;
c4826	for it <i>shall be</i> very grievous.
c4827	And for that the dream was doubled unto Pharaoh twice;
c4828	<i>it is</i> because the thing <i>is</i> established by God,
c4829	and God will shortly
c4830	bring it to pass.
c4831	Now
c4832	therefore let Pharaoh look out a man discreet and wise,
c4833	and set him over the land of Egypt.
c4834	Let Pharaoh do
c4835	<i>this,</i> and let him appoint officers over the land,
c4836	and take up the fifth part of the land of Egypt in the seven plenteous years.
c4837	And let them gather all the food of those good years that come,
c4838	and lay up corn under the hand of Pharaoh,
c4839	food in the cities.
c4840	and let them keep
c4841	And that food shall be for store to the land against the seven years of famine,
c4842	which shall be in the land of Egypt;
c4843	that the land perish not through the famine.
c4844	And the thing was good in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of all his servants.
c4845	And Pharaoh said unto his servants,
c4846	Can we find <i>such a one</i> as this <i>is,</i> a man
c4847	in whom the Spirit of God <i>is?</i>
c4848	And Pharaoh said unto Joseph,
c4849	Forasmuch as God hath shewed thee all this,
c4850	<i>there is</i> none so discreet and wise as thou <i>art:</i>
c4851	Thou shalt be over my house,
c4852	and according unto thy word shall all my people be ruled:
c4853	only in the throne will I be greater than thou.
c4854	And Pharaoh said unto Joseph,
c4855	See,
c4856	I have set thee over all the land of Egypt.
c4857	And Pharaoh took off his ring from his hand,
c4858	and put it upon Joseph's hand,
c4859	and arrayed him in vestures of fine linen,
c4860	and put a gold chain about his neck;
c4861	And he made him to ride in the second chariot
c4862	which
c4863	he had; and they cried before
c4864	him, Bow the knee:
c4865	and he made him <i>ruler</i> over all the land of Egypt.
c4866	And Pharaoh said unto Joseph,
c4867	I <i>am</i> Pharaoh,
c4868	and without thee shall no man lift up his hand or foot in all the land of Egypt.
c4869	And Pharaoh called Joseph's name Zaphnathpaaneah;
c4870	and he gave him to wife Asenath the daughter of Potipherah priest of On.
c4871	And Joseph went out over <i>all</i> the land of Egypt.
c4872	And Joseph <i>was</i> thirty years old
c4873	when he stood before Pharaoh king of Egypt.
c4874	And Joseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh,
c4875	and went throughout all the land of Egypt.
c4876	And in the seven plenteous years the earth brought forth by handfuls.
c4877	And he gathered up all the food of the seven years,
c4878	which were in the land of Egypt,
c4879	and laid up the food in the cities:
c4880	the food of the field, which <i>was</i> round about every city,
c4882	laid he up in the same.
c4883	And Joseph gathered corn as the sand of the sea, very much,
c4884	until he left numbering; for
c4886	<i>it was</i> without number.
c4887	And unto Joseph were born two sons
c4888	before the years of famine came,
c4889	which Asenath the daughter of Potipherah priest of On bare unto him.
c4890	And Joseph called the name of the firstborn Manasseh:
c4891	For God, <i>said he,</i> hath made me forget all my toil, and all my father's house.
c4892	And the name of the second called he Ephraim:
c4893	For God hath caused me to be fruitful in the land of my affliction.
c4894	And the seven years of plenteousness, that was in the land of Egypt, were ended.
c4896	And the seven years of dearth began
c4897	to come,
c4898	according as Joseph had said:
c4899	and the dearth was in all lands;
c4900	but in all the land of Egypt there was bread.
c4901	And when all the land of Egypt was famished,
c4902	the people cried to Pharaoh for bread:
c4903	and Pharaoh said unto all the Egyptians,
c4904	Go unto Joseph;
c4905	what he saith
c4906	to you, do.
c4907	And the famine was over all the face of the earth:
c4908	And Joseph opened all
c4909	the storehouses,
c4910	and sold unto the Egyptians; and the famine waxed sore in the land of Egypt.
c4912	And all countries came into Egypt
c4913	to Joseph for to buy
c4914	<i>corn;</i> because that the famine was <i>so</i> sore in all lands.
c4915	Now when Jacob saw
c4916	that there was corn in Egypt,
c4917	Jacob said unto his sons,
c4918	Why do ye look one upon another?
c4919	And he said,
c4920	Behold, I have heard
c4921	that there is corn in Egypt:
c4922	get you down thither,
c4923	and buy for us from thence;
c4924	that we may live,
c4925	and not die.
c4926	And Joseph's ten brethren went down
c4927	to buy corn in Egypt.
c4928	But Benjamin, Joseph's brother, Jacob sent not with his brethren;
c4929	for he said,
c4930	Lest peradventure mischief befall him.
c4931	And the sons of Israel came
c4932	to buy <i>corn</i> among
c4933	those that came:
c4934	for the famine was in the land of Canaan.
c4935	And Joseph
c4936	<i>was</i> the governor over the land, <i>and</i> he
c4938	<i>it was</i> that sold to all the people of the land:
c4939	and Joseph's brethren came,
c4940	and bowed down themselves
c4941	before him <i>with</i> their faces to the earth.
c4942	And Joseph saw his brethren,
c4943	and he knew
c4944	them, but made himself strange unto
c4945	them, and spake roughly unto
c4946	them; and he said unto
c4947	them, Whence come
c4948	ye? And they said,
c4949	From the land of Canaan
c4950	to buy food.
c4951	And Joseph knew his brethren,
c4952	but they knew not him.
c4953	And Joseph remembered the dreams
c4954	which he dreamed
c4955	of them, and said unto
c4956	them, Ye <i>are</i> spies;
c4957	to see the nakedness of the land
c4958	ye are come.
c4959	And they said unto
c4960	him, Nay,
c4961	my lord,
c4962	are thy servants come.
c4963	but to buy food
c4965	We <i>are</i> all one man's sons;
c4966	we <i>are</i> true
c4967	<i>men,</i> thy servants are no spies.
c4968	And he said unto
c4969	them, Nay,
c4970	but to see the nakedness of the land ye are come.
c4972	And they said,
c4973	Thy servants <i>are</i> twelve
c4974	brethren,
c4975	the sons of one man in the land of Canaan;
c4976	and, behold, the youngest <i>is</i> this day with our father,
c4977	and one
c4978	<i>is</i> not.
c4979	And Joseph said unto
c4980	them, That
c4981	<i>is it</i> that I spake unto
c4982	you, saying,
c4983	Ye <i>are</i> spies:
c4984	Hereby ye shall be proved:
c4985	By the life of Pharaoh
c4986	ye shall not go forth hence,
c4987	except your youngest brother come hither.
c4988	Send one of
c4989	you, and let him fetch your brother,
c4990	and ye shall be kept in prison,
c4991	that your words may be proved,
c4992	whether <i>there be any</i> truth in
c4993	you: or else
c4994	by the life of Pharaoh
c4995	surely ye <i>are</i> spies.
c4996	And he put them all together into ward three days.
c4997	And Joseph said unto them the third day,
c4998	This do,
c4999	and live;
c5000	<i>for</i> I fear God:
c5001	If ye <i>be</i> true
c5002	<i>men,</i> let one of your brethren be bound in the house of your prison:
c5003	go ye,
c5004	carry corn for the famine of your houses:
c5005	But bring your youngest brother unto
c5006	me; so shall your words be verified,
c5007	and ye shall not die.
c5008	And they did so.
c5009	And they said
c5010	one to another,
c5011	We <i>are</i> verily guilty concerning our brother,
c5012	in that we saw the anguish of his soul,
c5013	when he besought
c5014	us, and we would not hear;
c5015	therefore is this distress come upon us.
c5016	And Reuben answered
c5017	them, saying,
c5018	Spake I not unto
c5019	you, saying,
c5020	Do not sin against the child;
c5021	and ye would not hear?
c5023	therefore, behold, also his blood is required.
c5024	And they knew not
c5025	that Joseph understood
c5026	<i>them;</i> for he spake unto them by an interpreter.
c5027	And he turned himself about from
c5028	them, and wept;
c5029	and returned to
c5030	them again, and communed with
c5031	them, and took from them Simeon,
c5032	and bound him before their eyes.
c5033	Then Joseph commanded
c5034	to fill their sacks with corn,
c5035	and to restore every man's money
c5036	into his sack,
c5037	and to give them provision for the way:
c5038	and thus did he unto them.
c5039	And they laded their asses with the corn,
c5040	and departed thence.
c5041	And as one of them opened his sack
c5042	to give his ass provender in the inn,
c5043	he espied his money;
c5044	for, behold, it <i>was</i> in his sack's mouth.
c5045	And he said unto his brethren,
c5046	My money is restored;
c5047	and, lo, <i>it is</i> even in my sack:
c5048	and their heart failed
c5049	<i>them,</i> and they were afraid,
c5050	one to another,
c5051	saying
c5052	What <i>is</i> this <i>that</i> God hath done unto us?
c5053	And they came unto Jacob their father unto the land of Canaan,
c5054	and told him all
c5055	that befell
c5056	unto them; saying,
c5057	The man, <i>who is</i> the lord of the land, spake roughly to
c5058	us, and took
c5059	us for spies of the country.
c5060	And we said unto
c5061	him, We <i>are</i> true
c5062	<i>men;</i> we are no spies:
c5063	We <i>be</i> twelve
c5064	brethren,
c5065	sons of our father;
c5066	one
c5067	<i>is</i> not,
c5068	and the youngest <i>is</i> this day with our father in the land of Canaan.
c5069	And the man, the lord of the country, said unto
c5070	us, Hereby shall I know
c5071	that ye <i>are</i> true
c5072	<i>men;</i> leave one of your brethren <i>here</i> with
c5073	me, and take <i>food for</i> the famine of your households,
c5074	and be gone:
c5075	And bring your youngest brother unto
c5076	me: then shall I know
c5077	that ye <i>are</i> no spies,
c5078	but <i>that</i> ye <i>are</i> true
c5079	<i>men: so</i> will I deliver you your brother,
c5080	and ye shall traffick in the land.
c5081	And it came to pass
c5082	as they emptied their sacks,
c5083	that, behold, every man's bundle of money <i>was</i> in his sack:
c5084	and when <i>both</i> they and their father saw the bundles of money,
c5085	they were afraid.
c5086	And Jacob their father said unto
c5087	them, Me have ye bereaved
c5088	<i>of my children:</i> Joseph
c5089	<i>is</i> not,
c5090	and Simeon
c5091	<i>is</i> not,
c5092	and ye will take Benjamin
c5093	<i>away:</i> all these things are against me.
c5094	And Reuben spake unto his father,
c5095	saying,
c5096	Slay my two sons,
c5097	if I bring him not to
c5098	thee: deliver him into my hand,
c5099	and I will bring him to thee again.
c5100	And he said,
c5101	My son shall not go down with
c5102	you; for his brother is dead,
c5103	and he is left alone:
c5104	if mischief befall him by the way
c5105	in the which ye go,
c5106	then shall ye bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave.
c5107	And the famine <i>was</i> sore in the land.
c5108	And it came to pass,
c5109	when they had eaten up
c5110	the corn
c5111	which they had brought out of Egypt,
c5112	their father said unto
c5113	them, Go again,
c5114	buy us a little food.
c5115	And Judah spake unto
c5116	him, saying,
c5117	The man did solemnly protest
c5118	unto us, saying,
c5119	Ye shall not see my face,
c5120	except your brother <i>be</i> with you.
c5121	If thou wilt send our brother with
c5122	us, we will go down
c5123	and buy thee food:
c5124	But if thou wilt not send
c5125	<i>him,</i> we will not go down:
c5126	for the man said unto
c5127	us, Ye shall not see my face,
c5128	except your brother <i>be</i> with you.
c5129	And Israel said,
c5130	Wherefore dealt ye <i>so</i> ill
c5131	with me, <i>as</i> to tell the man
c5132	whether ye had yet a brother?
c5133	And they said,
c5134	The man asked us straitly of our state, and of our kindred,
c5135	saying,
c5136	<i>Is</i> your father yet alive?
c5137	have ye <i>another</i> brother?
c5138	and we told him according to the tenor of these words:
c5139	could we certainly know
c5140	that he would say,
c5141	Bring your brother down?
c5142	And Judah said unto Israel his father,
c5143	Send the lad with
c5144	me, and we will arise
c5145	and go;
c5146	that we may live,
c5147	and not die, both we, and thou, <i>and</i> also our little ones.
c5148	I will be surety
c5149	for him; of my hand shalt thou require
c5150	him: if I bring him not unto
c5151	thee, and set him before
c5152	thee, then let me bear the blame for ever:
c5153	For except we had lingered,
c5154	surely now we had returned this second time.
c5155	And their father Israel said unto
c5156	them, If <i>it must be</i> so
c5157	now, do this;
c5158	take of the best fruits in the land in your vessels,
c5159	and carry down the man a present, a little balm, and a little honey, spices, and myrrh, nuts, and almonds:
c5160	And take double money in your hand;
c5161	and the money
c5162	that was brought again in the mouth of your sacks,
c5163	carry <i>it</i> again in your hand;
c5164	peradventure it <i>was</i> an oversight:
c5165	Take also your brother,
c5166	and arise,
c5167	go again unto the man:
c5168	And God Almighty give you mercy before the man,
c5169	that he may send away your other brother, and Benjamin.
c5171	If I be bereaved
c5172	<i>of my children,</i> I am bereaved.
c5173	And the men took that present,
c5174	and they took double money in their hand,
c5175	and Benjamin;
c5176	and rose up,
c5177	and went down to Egypt,
c5178	and stood before Joseph.
c5179	And when Joseph saw Benjamin with
c5180	them, he said
c5181	to the ruler of his house,
c5182	Bring <i>these</i> men home,
c5183	and slay,
c5184	and make ready;
c5185	for <i>these</i> men shall dine with me at noon.
c5186	And the man did
c5187	as Joseph bade;
c5188	and the man brought the men into Joseph's house.
c5189	And the men were afraid,
c5190	because they were brought into Joseph's house;
c5191	and they said,
c5192	Because of the money
c5193	that was returned in our sacks at the first time
c5194	are we brought in;
c5195	that he may seek occasion against
c5196	us, and fall upon
c5197	us, and take us for bondmen, and our asses.
c5198	And they came near to the steward
c5199	of Joseph's house,
c5200	and they communed with him at the door of the house,
c5201	And said,
c5202	O sir,
c5203	we came indeed down at the first time
c5204	to buy food:
c5205	And it came to pass,
c5206	when we came to the inn,
c5207	that we opened our sacks,
c5208	and, behold, <i>every</i> man's money <i>was</i> in the mouth of his sack,
c5209	our money in full weight:
c5210	and we have brought it again in our hand.
c5211	And other money have we brought down in our hands
c5212	to buy food:
c5213	we cannot tell
c5214	who put our money in our sacks.
c5215	And he said,
c5216	Peace
c5217	<i>be</i> to you, fear not:
c5218	your God, and the God of your father, hath given you treasure in your sacks:
c5219	I had your money. And he brought Simeon out unto them.
c5221	And the man brought the men into Joseph's house,
c5222	and gave <i>them</i> water,
c5223	and they washed their feet;
c5224	and he gave their asses provender.
c5225	And they made ready the present
c5226	against Joseph came at noon:
c5227	for they heard
c5228	that they should eat bread there.
c5229	And when Joseph came home,
c5230	they brought him the present
c5231	which <i>was</i> in their hand
c5232	into the house,
c5233	and bowed themselves to him to the earth.
c5234	And he asked them of <i>their</i> welfare,
c5235	and said,
c5236	<i>Is</i> your father well, the old man
c5237	of whom ye spake?
c5238	<i>Is</i> he yet alive?
c5239	And they answered,
c5240	Thy servant our father <i>is</i> in good health,
c5241	he <i>is</i> yet alive.
c5242	And they bowed down their heads,
c5243	and made obeisance.
c5244	And he lifted up his eyes,
c5245	and saw his brother Benjamin, his mother's son,
c5246	and said,
c5247	<i>Is</i> this your younger brother,
c5248	of whom ye spake unto
c5249	me? And he said,
c5250	God be gracious
c5251	unto thee, my son.
c5252	And Joseph made haste;
c5253	for his bowels did yearn upon his brother:
c5254	and he sought
c5255	<i>where</i> to weep;
c5256	and he entered into <i>his</i> chamber,
c5257	and wept there.
c5258	And he washed his face,
c5259	and went out,
c5260	and refrained himself,
c5261	and said,
c5262	Set on bread.
c5263	And they set on for him by himself, and for them by themselves, and for the Egyptians,
c5264	which did eat with
c5265	him, by themselves:
c5266	because the Egyptians might not
c5267	eat bread with the Hebrews;
c5268	for that <i>is</i> an abomination unto the Egyptians.
c5269	And they sat before
c5270	him, the firstborn according to his birthright,
c5271	and the youngest according to his youth:
c5272	and the men marvelled
c5273	one at another.
c5274	And he took <i>and sent</i> messes unto them from before
c5275	him: but Benjamin's mess was five times so much as any
c5276	of theirs. And they drank,
c5277	and were merry with him.
c5278	And he commanded
c5279	the steward of his house,
c5280	saying,
c5281	Fill the men's sacks <i>with</i> food,
c5282	as much as they can
c5283	carry,
c5284	and put every man's money in his sack's mouth.
c5285	And put my cup, the silver cup, in the sack's mouth of the youngest,
c5286	and his corn money.
c5287	And he did according to the word that Joseph
c5288	had spoken.
c5289	As soon as the morning was light,
c5290	the men were sent away, they and their asses.
c5291	<i>And</i> when they were gone out of the city,
c5292	<i>and</i> not <i>yet</i> far off,
c5293	Joseph said
c5294	unto his steward,
c5295	Up,
c5296	follow after the men;
c5297	and when thou dost overtake
c5298	them, say unto
c5299	them, Wherefore have ye rewarded evil for good?
c5300	<i>Is</i> not this
c5301	<i>it</i> in which my lord drinketh,
c5302	and whereby indeed he divineth?
c5303	ye have done evil
c5304	in so doing.
c5305	And he overtook
c5306	them, and he spake unto them these same words.
c5307	And they said unto
c5308	him, Wherefore saith my lord these words?
c5309	God forbid that thy servants
c5310	should do according to this thing:
c5311	Behold, the money,
c5312	which we found in our sacks' mouths,
c5313	we brought again unto thee out of the land of Canaan:
c5314	how then should we steal out of thy lord's house silver or gold?
c5315	With whomsoever of thy servants it be found,
c5316	both let him die,
c5317	and we also will be my lord's bondmen.
c5318	And he said,
c5319	Now also <i>let</i> it <i>be</i> according unto your words:
c5320	he with whom it is found
c5321	shall be my servant;
c5322	and ye shall be blameless.
c5323	Then they speedily
c5324	took down
c5325	every man his sack to the ground,
c5326	and opened
c5327	every man his sack.
c5328	And he searched,
c5329	<i>and</i> began at the eldest,
c5330	and left at the youngest:
c5331	and the cup was found in Benjamin's sack.
c5332	Then they rent their clothes,
c5333	and laded
c5334	every man his ass,
c5335	and returned to the city.
c5336	And Judah and his brethren came to Joseph's house;
c5337	for he
c5338	<i>was</i> yet there:
c5339	and they fell before him on the ground.
c5340	And Joseph said
c5341	unto them, What deed <i>is</i> this
c5342	that ye have done?
c5343	wot ye not
c5344	that such a man as I can certainly divine?
c5346	And Judah said,
c5347	What shall we say unto my lord?
c5348	what shall we speak?
c5349	or how shall we clear ourselves?
c5350	God hath found out the iniquity of thy servants:
c5351	behold, we <i>are</i> my lord's servants,
c5352	both we,
c5353	and <i>he</i> also with whom the cup is found.
c5354	And he said,
c5355	God forbid
c5356	that I should do so:
c5357	<i>but</i> the man
c5358	in whose hand the cup is found,
c5359	he shall be my servant;
c5360	and as for you, get you up in peace unto your father.
c5361	Then Judah came near unto him,
c5362	and said,
c5363	Oh my lord,
c5364	let thy servant, I pray thee, speak a word in my lord's ears,
c5365	and let not thine anger burn against thy servant:
c5366	for thou <i>art</i> even as Pharaoh.
c5367	My lord asked his servants,
c5368	saying,
c5369	Have ye a father, or a brother?
c5370	And we said unto my lord,
c5371	We have a father, an old man, and a child of his old age, a little one;
c5372	and his brother is dead,
c5373	and he alone is left of his mother,
c5374	and his father loveth him.
c5375	And thou saidst unto thy servants,
c5376	Bring him down unto
c5377	me, that I may set mine eyes upon him.
c5378	And we said unto my lord,
c5379	The lad cannot
c5380	leave his father:
c5381	for <i>if</i> he should leave his father,
c5382	<i>his father</i> would die.
c5383	And thou saidst unto thy servants,
c5384	Except your youngest brother come down with
c5385	no more.
c5386	you, ye shall see my face
c5387	And it came to pass
c5388	when we came up unto thy servant my father,
c5389	we told him the words of my lord.
c5390	And our father said,
c5391	Go again,
c5392	<i>and</i> buy us a little food.
c5393	And we said,
c5394	We cannot
c5395	go down:
c5396	if our youngest brother be with
c5397	us, then will we go down:
c5398	for we may not
c5399	see the man's face,
c5401	except our youngest brother <i>be</i> with us.
c5402	And thy servant my father said unto
c5403	us, Ye know
c5404	that my wife bare me two <i>sons:</i>
c5405	And the one went out from
c5406	me, and I said,
c5407	Surely he is torn in pieces;
c5408	and I saw him not since:
c5409	And if ye take this also from me,
c5410	and mischief befall
c5411	him, ye shall bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave.
c5412	Now
c5413	therefore when I come to thy servant my father,
c5414	and the lad
c5415	<i>be</i> not with
c5416	us; seeing that his life is bound up in the lad's life;
c5417	It shall come to pass,
c5418	when he seeth
c5419	that the lad <i>is</i> not
c5420	<i>with us,</i> that he will die:
c5421	and thy servants shall bring down the gray hairs of thy servant our father with sorrow to the grave.
c5422	For thy servant became surety for the lad unto my father,
c5423	saying,
c5424	If I bring him not unto
c5425	thee, then I shall bear the blame to my father for ever.
c5426	Now
c5427	therefore, I pray thee, let thy servant abide instead of the lad a bondman to my lord;
c5428	and let the lad go up with his brethren.
c5429	For how shall I go up to my father,
c5430	and the lad
c5431	<i>be</i> not with
c5432	me? lest peradventure I see the evil
c5433	that shall come on my father.
c5434	Then Joseph could not
c5435	refrain himself before all
c5436	them that stood by
c5437	him; and he cried,
c5438	Cause every man to go out from
c5439	me. And there stood no man with
c5440	him, while Joseph made himself known unto his brethren.
c5441	And he wept aloud:
c5442	and the Egyptians and the house of Pharaoh heard.
c5444	And Joseph said unto his brethren,
c5445	I <i>am</i> Joseph;
c5446	doth my father yet live?
c5447	And his brethren could not
c5448	answer
c5449	him; for they were troubled at his presence.
c5450	And Joseph said unto his brethren,
c5451	Come near to me, I pray you.
c5452	And they came near.
c5453	And he said,
c5454	I <i>am</i> Joseph your brother,
c5455	whom ye sold into Egypt.
c5456	Now
c5457	therefore be not grieved,
c5458	nor angry with yourselves,
c5459	that ye sold me hither:
c5460	for God did send me before you to preserve life.
c5461	For these two years <i>hath</i> the famine <i>been</i> in the land:
c5462	and yet <i>there are</i> five years,
c5463	in the which <i>there shall</i> neither <i>be</i> earing nor harvest.
c5464	And God sent me before
c5465	you to preserve you a posterity in the earth,
c5466	and to save your lives by a great deliverance.
c5467	So now
c5468	<i>it was</i> not you <i>that</i> sent me hither,
c5469	but God:
c5470	and he hath made me a father to Pharaoh, and lord of all his house,
c5471	and a ruler throughout all the land of Egypt.
c5472	Haste
c5473	ye, and go up to my father,
c5474	and say unto
c5475	him, Thus saith thy son Joseph,
c5476	God hath made me lord of all Egypt:
c5477	come down unto
c5478	me, tarry not:
c5479	And thou shalt dwell in the land of Goshen,
c5480	and thou shalt be near unto me, thou, and thy children, and thy children's children, and thy flocks, and thy herds, and all
c5481	that thou hast:
c5482	And there will I nourish
c5483	thee; for yet <i>there are</i> five years of famine;
c5484	lest thou, and thy household, and all that thou hast, come to poverty.
c5486	And, behold, your eyes see, and the eyes of my brother Benjamin,
c5487	that <i>it is</i> my mouth
c5488	that speaketh unto you.
c5489	And ye shall tell my father of all my glory in Egypt, and of all
c5490	that ye have seen;
c5491	and ye shall haste
c5492	and bring down my father hither.
c5493	And he fell upon his brother Benjamin's neck,
c5494	and wept;
c5495	and Benjamin wept upon his neck.
c5496	Moreover he kissed all his brethren,
c5497	and wept upon
c5498	them: and after that his brethren talked with him.
c5499	And the fame thereof was heard in Pharaoh's house,
c5500	saying,
c5501	Joseph's brethren are come:
c5502	and it pleased Pharaoh well, and his servants.
c5503	And Pharaoh said unto Joseph,
c5504	Say unto thy brethren,
c5505	This do
c5506	ye; lade your beasts,
c5507	and go,
c5508	get you unto the land of Canaan;
c5509	And take your father and your households,
c5510	and come unto
c5511	me: and I will give you the good of the land of Egypt,
c5512	and ye shall eat the fat of the land.
c5513	Now thou art commanded,
c5514	this do
c5515	ye; take you wagons out of the land of Egypt for your little ones, and for your wives,
c5516	and bring your father,
c5517	and come.
c5518	Also regard not your stuff;
c5519	for the good of all the land of Egypt <i>is</i> yours.
c5521	And the children of Israel did so:
c5522	and Joseph gave them wagons, according to the commandment of Pharaoh,
c5523	and gave them provision for the way.
c5524	To all of them he gave each man changes of raiment;
c5525	but to Benjamin he gave three hundred <i>pieces</i> of silver, and five changes of raiment.
c5526	And to his father he sent after this <i>manner;</i> ten asses
c5527	laden with the good things of Egypt,
c5528	and ten she asses
c5529	laden with corn and bread and meat for his father by the way.
c5530	So he sent his brethren
c5531	away, and they departed:
c5532	and he said unto
c5533	them, See that ye fall not out by the way.
c5534	And they went up out of Egypt,
c5535	and came into the land of Canaan unto Jacob their father,
c5536	And told
c5537	him, saying,
c5538	Joseph <i>is</i> yet alive,
c5539	and he <i>is</i> governor over all the land of Egypt. And Jacob's heart fainted, for
c5541	he believed them not.
c5542	And they told him all the words of Joseph,
c5543	which he had said unto
c5544	them: and when he saw the wagons
c5545	which Joseph had sent
c5546	to carry
c5547	him, the spirit of Jacob their father revived:
c5548	And Israel said,
c5549	<i>It is</i> enough;
c5550	Joseph my son <i>is</i> yet alive:
c5551	I will go
c5552	and see
c5553	him before I die.
c5554	And Israel took his journey with all
c5555	that
c5556	he had, and came to Beersheba,
c5557	and offered sacrifices unto the God of his father Isaac.
c5558	And God spake unto Israel in the visions of the night,
c5559	and said,
c5560	Jacob, Jacob.
c5561	And he said,
c5562	Here <i>am</i> I.
c5563	And he said,
c5564	I <i>am</i> God, the God of thy father:
c5565	fear not
c5566	to go down into Egypt;
c5567	for I will there make of thee a great nation:
c5568	I will go down with thee into Egypt;
c5569	and I will also surely bring thee up
c5570	<i>again:</i> and Joseph shall put his hand upon thine eyes.
c5571	And Jacob rose up from Beersheba:
c5572	and the sons of Israel carried Jacob their father, and their little ones, and their wives, in the wagons
c5573	which Pharaoh had sent
c5574	to carry him.
c5575	And they took their cattle, and their goods,
c5576	which they had gotten in the land of Canaan,
c5577	and came into Egypt, Jacob, and all his seed with him:
c5578	His sons, and his sons' sons with him, his daughters, and his sons' daughters, and all his seed brought he with him into Egypt.
c5579	And these <i>are</i> the names of the children of Israel,
c5580	which came into Egypt,
c5581	Jacob and his sons:
c5582	Reuben, Jacob's firstborn.
c5583	And the sons of Reuben; Hanoch, and Phallu, and Hezron, and Carmi.
c5584	And the sons of Simeon; Jemuel, and Jamin, and Ohad, and Jachin, and Zohar, and Shaul the son of a Canaanitish woman.
c5585	And the sons of Levi; Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.
c5586	And the sons of Judah; Er, and Onan, and Shelah, and Pharez, and Zerah:
c5587	but Er and Onan died in the land of Canaan.
c5588	And the sons of Pharez were Hezron and Hamul.
c5589	And the sons of Issachar; Tola, and Phuvah, and Job, and Shimron.
c5590	And the sons of Zebulun; Sered, and Elon, and Jahleel.
c5591	These <i>be</i> the sons of Leah,
c5592	which she bare unto Jacob in Padanaram,
c5593	with his daughter Dinah:
c5594	all the souls of his sons and his daughters <i>were</i> thirty and three.
c5595	And the sons of Gad; Ziphion, and Haggi, Shuni, and Ezbon, Eri, and Arodi, and Areli.
c5596	And the sons of Asher; Jimnah, and Ishuah, and Isui, and Beriah, and Serah their sister:
c5597	and the sons of Beriah; Heber, and Malchiel.
c5598	These <i>are</i> the sons of Zilpah,
c5599	whom Laban gave to Leah his daughter,
c5600	and these she bare unto Jacob, <i>even</i> sixteen souls.
c5601	The sons of Rachel Jacob's wife; Joseph, and Benjamin.
c5602	And unto Joseph in the land of Egypt were born
c5603	which Asenath the daughter of Potipherah priest of On bare unto him.
c5604	Manasseh and Ephraim,
c5605	And the sons of Benjamin <i>were</i> Belah, and Becher, and Ashbel, Gera, and Naaman, Ehi, and Rosh, Muppim, and Huppim, and Ard.
c5606	These <i>are</i> the sons of Rachel,
c5607	which were born to Jacob:
c5608	all the souls <i>were</i> fourteen.
c5609	And the sons of Dan; Hushim.
c5610	And the sons of Naphtali; Jahzeel, and Guni, and Jezer, and Shillem.
c5611	These <i>are</i> the sons of Bilhah,
c5612	which Laban gave unto Rachel his daughter,
c5613	and she bare these unto Jacob:
c5614	all the souls <i>were</i> seven.
c5615	All the souls
c5616	that came with Jacob into Egypt,
c5617	which came out of his loins,
c5618	besides Jacob's sons' wives,
c5619	all the souls <i>were</i> threescore and six;
c5620	And the sons of Joseph,
c5621	which were born him in Egypt,
c5622	<i>were</i> two souls:
c5623	all the souls of the house of Jacob,
c5624	which came into Egypt,
c5625	<i>were</i> threescore and ten.
c5626	And he sent Judah before him unto Joseph,
c5627	to direct his face unto Goshen;
c5628	and they came into the land of Goshen.
c5629	And Joseph made ready his chariot,
c5630	and went up
c5631	to meet Israel his father,
c5632	to Goshen,
c5633	and presented himself unto
c5634	him; and he fell on his neck,
c5635	and wept on his neck a good while.
c5636	And Israel said unto Joseph,
c5637	Now let me die,
c5638	since I have seen thy face,
c5639	because thou <i>art</i> yet alive.
c5640	And Joseph said unto his brethren, and unto his father's house,
c5641	I will go up,
c5642	and shew Pharaoh,
c5643	and say unto
c5644	him, My brethren, and my father's house,
c5645	which <i>were</i> in the land of Canaan,
c5646	are come unto me;
c5647	And the men <i>are</i> shepherds,
c5648	for their trade hath been to feed cattle;
c5649	their flocks, and their herds, and all
c5650	that they have.
c5651	and they have brought
c5652	And it shall come to pass,
c5653	when Pharaoh shall call
c5654	you, and shall say,
c5655	What <i>is</i> your occupation?
c5656	That ye shall say,
c5657	Thy servants' trade hath been about cattle from our youth even until now, both we, <i>and</i> also our fathers:
c5658	that ye may dwell in the land of Goshen;
c5659	for every shepherd <i>is</i> an abomination unto the Egyptians.
c5661	Then Joseph came
c5662	and told Pharaoh,
c5663	and said,
c5664	My father and my brethren, and their flocks, and their herds, and all
c5665	that
c5666	they have, are come out of the land of Canaan;
c5667	and, behold, they <i>are</i> in the land of Goshen.
c5668	And he took some of his brethren, <i>even</i> five men,
c5669	and presented them unto Pharaoh.
c5670	And Pharaoh said unto his brethren,
c5671	What <i>is</i> your occupation?
c5672	And they said unto Pharaoh,
c5673	Thy servants <i>are</i> shepherds, both we, <i>and</i> also our fathers.
c5674	They said moreover unto Pharaoh,
c5675	For to sojourn in the land
c5676	are we come;
c5677	for thy servants have no pasture for their flocks;
c5679	for the famine <i>is</i> sore in the land of Canaan:
c5680	now
c5681	therefore, we pray thee, let thy servants dwell in the land of Goshen.
c5682	And Pharaoh spake unto Joseph,
c5683	saying,
c5684	Thy father and thy brethren are come unto thee:
c5685	The land of Egypt
c5686	<i>is</i> before
c5687	thee; in the best of the land make thy father and brethren to dwell;
c5688	in the land of Goshen let them dwell:
c5689	and if thou knowest
c5690	<i>any</i> men of activity
c5691	among them, then make them rulers over my cattle.
c5693	And Joseph brought in Jacob his father,
c5694	and set him before Pharaoh:
c5695	and Jacob blessed Pharaoh.
c5696	And Pharaoh said unto Jacob,
c5697	How old <i>art</i> thou?
c5698	And Jacob said unto Pharaoh,
c5699	The days of the years of my pilgrimage <i>are</i> an hundred and thirty years:
c5700	few and evil have the days of the years of my life been,
c5701	and have not attained unto the days of the years of the life of my fathers in the days of their pilgrimage.
c5702	And Jacob blessed Pharaoh,
c5703	and went out from before Pharaoh.
c5704	And Joseph placed his father and his brethren,
c5705	and gave them a possession in the land of Egypt, in the best of the land, in the land of Rameses,
c5706	as Pharaoh had commanded.
c5707	And Joseph nourished his father, and his brethren, and all his father's household, with bread, according to <i>their</i> families.
c5708	And <i>there was</i> no bread in all the land;
c5709	for the famine <i>was</i> very sore,
c5710	so that the land of Egypt and <i>all</i> the land of Canaan fainted by reason of the famine.
c5711	And Joseph gathered up all the money
c5712	that was found in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan,
c5713	for the corn
c5714	which they bought:
c5715	and Joseph brought the money into Pharaoh's house.
c5716	And when money failed in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan,
c5717	all the Egyptians came unto Joseph,
c5718	and said,
c5719	Give us bread:
c5720	for why should we die in thy presence?
c5721	for the money faileth.
c5722	And Joseph said,
c5723	Give your cattle;
c5724	and I will give you for your cattle,
c5725	if money fail.
c5726	And they brought their cattle unto Joseph:
c5727	and Joseph gave them bread <i>in exchange</i> for horses, and for the flocks, and for the cattle of the herds, and for the asses:
c5728	and he fed them with bread for all their cattle for that year.
c5729	When that year was ended,
c5730	they came unto him the second year,
c5731	and said
c5732	unto him, We will not hide <i>it</i> from my lord,
c5733	how that our money is spent;
c5734	my lord also hath our herds of cattle;
c5735	there is not ought left in the sight of my lord,
c5736	but our bodies, and our lands:
c5737	Wherefore shall we die before thine eyes, both we and our land?
c5738	buy us and our land for bread,
c5739	and we and our land will be servants unto Pharaoh:
c5740	and give <i>us</i> seed,
c5741	that we may live,
c5742	and not die,
c5743	that the land be not desolate.
c5744	And Joseph bought all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh;
c5745	for the Egyptians sold every man his field,
c5746	because the famine prevailed over
c5747	them: so the land became Pharaoh's.
c5748	And as for the people,
c5749	he removed them to cities from <i>one</i> end of the borders of Egypt even to the <i>other</i> end thereof.
c5750	Only the land of the priests bought he not;
c5751	for the priests had a portion <i>assigned them</i> of Pharaoh,
c5752	and did eat their portion
c5753	which Pharaoh gave
c5754	them: wherefore they sold not their lands.
c5755	Then Joseph said unto the people,
c5756	Behold, I have bought you this day and your land for Pharaoh:
c5757	lo, <i>here is</i> seed
c5758	for you, and ye shall sow the land.
c5759	And it shall come to pass in the increase,
c5760	that ye shall give the fifth <i>part</i> unto Pharaoh,
c5761	and four parts shall be your own, for seed of the field, and for your food,
c5762	and for them of your households,
c5763	and for food for your little ones.
c5764	And they said,
c5765	Thou hast saved our lives:
c5766	let us find grace in the sight of my lord,
c5767	and we will be Pharaoh's servants.
c5768	And Joseph made it a law over the land of Egypt unto this day,
c5769	<i>that</i> Pharaoh should have the fifth
c5770	<i>part;</i> except the land of the priests only, <i>which</i> became not Pharaoh's.
c5771	And Israel dwelt in the land of Egypt, in the country of Goshen;
c5772	and they had possessions
c5773	therein, and grew,
c5774	and multiplied exceedingly.
c5775	And Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years:
c5776	so the whole age of Jacob was an hundred forty and seven years.
c5777	And the time drew nigh that Israel
c5778	must die:
c5779	and he called his son Joseph,
c5780	and said
c5781	unto him, If now I have found grace in thy sight,
c5782	put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh,
c5783	and deal kindly and truly with
c5784	me; bury me not, I pray thee, in Egypt:
c5785	But I will lie with my fathers,
c5786	and thou shalt carry me out of Egypt,
c5787	and bury me in their buryingplace.
c5788	And he said,
c5789	I will do as thou hast said.
c5790	And he said,
c5791	Swear
c5792	unto me. And he sware
c5793	unto him. And Israel bowed himself upon the bed's head.
c5794	And it came to pass after these things,
c5795	that <i>one</i> told Joseph,
c5796	Behold, thy father <i>is</i> sick:
c5797	and he took with him his two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim.
c5798	And <i>one</i> told Jacob,
c5799	and said,
c5800	Behold, thy son Joseph cometh unto
c5801	thee: and Israel strengthened himself,
c5802	and sat upon the bed.
c5803	And Jacob said unto Joseph,
c5804	God Almighty appeared unto me at Luz in the land of Canaan,
c5805	and blessed me,
c5806	And said unto
c5807	me, Behold, I will make thee fruitful,
c5808	and multiply
c5809	thee, and I will make of thee a multitude of people;
c5810	and will give this land to thy seed after thee <i>for</i> an everlasting possession.
c5811	And now
c5812	thy two sons,
c5814	before I came unto thee into Egypt, <i>are</i> mine; as Reuben and Simeon, they shall be mine.
c5816	Ephraim and Manasseh, which were born unto thee in the land of Egypt
c5817	And thy issue,
c5818	which thou begettest after
c5819	them, shall be
c5820	thine, <i>and</i> shall be called after the name of their brethren in their inheritance.
c5821	And as for me,
c5822	when I came from Padan,
c5823	Rachel died by me in the land of Canaan in the way, when yet <i>there was</i> but a little way
c5824	to come unto Ephrath:
c5825	and I buried her there in the way of Ephrath;
c5826	the same <i>is</i> Bethlehem.
c5827	And Israel beheld Joseph's sons,
c5828	and said,
c5829	Who <i>are</i> these?
c5830	And Joseph said unto his father,
c5831	They <i>are</i> my sons,
c5832	whom God hath given me in this
c5833	<i>place.</i> And he said,
c5834	Bring them, I pray thee, unto
c5835	me, and I will bless them.
c5836	Now the eyes of Israel were dim for age,
c5837	<i>so that</i> he could not
c5838	see.
c5839	And he brought them near unto
c5840	him; and he kissed
c5841	them, and embraced them.
c5842	And Israel said unto Joseph,
c5843	to see thy face:
c5844	I had not thought
c5845	and, lo,
c5846	God hath shewed me also thy seed.
c5847	And Joseph brought them out from between his knees,
c5848	and he bowed himself with his face to the earth.
c5849	And Joseph took them both,
c5850	Ephraim in his right hand toward Israel's left hand,
c5851	and Manasseh in his left hand toward Israel's right hand,
c5852	and brought <i>them</i> near unto him.
c5853	And Israel stretched out his right hand,
c5854	and laid <i>it</i> upon Ephraim's head,
c5855	who <i>was</i> the younger,
c5856	and his left hand upon Manasseh's head,
c5857	guiding his hands wittingly;
c5858	for Manasseh <i>was</i> the firstborn.
c5859	And he blessed Joseph,
c5860	and said,
c5861	God,
c5862	before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac did walk,
c5863	the God
c5864	which fed me all my life long unto this day,
c5865	The Angel
c5866	which redeemed me from all evil,
c5867	bless the lads;
c5868	and let my name be named on them, and the name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac;
c5869	and let them grow into a multitude in the midst of the earth.
c5870	And when Joseph saw
c5871	that his father laid his right hand upon the head of Ephraim,
c5872	it displeased
c5873	him: and he held up his father's hand,
c5874	to remove it from Ephraim's head unto Manasseh's head.
c5875	And Joseph said unto his father,
c5876	Not so,
c5877	my father:
c5878	for this <i>is</i> the firstborn;
c5879	put thy right hand upon his head.
c5880	And his father refused,
c5881	and said,
c5882	I know
c5883	<i>it,</i> my son,
c5884	I know
c5885	<i>it:</i> he also shall become a people,
c5886	and he also shall be great:
c5887	but truly his younger brother shall be greater than
c5888	he, and his seed shall become a multitude of nations.
c5889	And he blessed them that day,
c5890	saying,
c5891	In thee shall Israel bless,
c5892	saying,
c5893	God make thee as Ephraim and as Manasseh:
c5894	and he set Ephraim before Manasseh.
c5895	And Israel said unto Joseph,
c5896	Behold, I die:
c5897	but God shall be with
c5898	you, and bring you again unto the land of your fathers.
c5899	Moreover I have given to thee one portion above thy brethren,
c5900	which I took out of the hand of the Amorite with my sword and with my bow.
c5901	And Jacob called unto his sons,
c5902	and said,
c5903	Gather yourselves together,
c5904	that I may tell
c5905	you <i>that</i> which shall befall you in the last days.
c5906	Gather yourselves together,
c5907	and hear,
c5908	ye sons of Jacob;
c5909	and hearken unto Israel your father.
c5910	Reuben,
c5911	thou <i>art</i> my firstborn,
c5912	my might, and the beginning of my strength,
c5913	the excellency of dignity, and the excellency of power:
c5914	Unstable as water,
c5915	thou shalt not excel;
c5916	because thou wentest up to thy father's bed;
c5917	then defiledst
c5918	thou <i>it:</i> he went up to my couch.
c5919	Simeon and Levi <i>are</i> brethren;
c5920	instruments of cruelty <i>are in</i> their habitations.
c5921	O my soul, come not thou into their secret;
c5922	unto their assembly, mine honour, be not thou united:
c5923	for in their anger they slew a man,
c5924	and in their selfwill they digged down a wall.
c5925	Cursed <i>be</i> their anger,
c5926	for <i>it was</i> fierce;
c5927	and their wrath,
c5928	for it was cruel:
c5929	I will divide them in Jacob,
c5930	and scatter them in Israel.
c5931	Judah,
c5932	thou
c5933	<i>art he</i> whom thy brethren shall praise:
c5934	thy hand <i>shall be</i> in the neck of thine enemies;
c5935	thy father's children shall bow down before thee.
c5936	Judah <i>is</i> a lion's whelp:
c5937	from the prey,
c5938	my son,
c5939	thou art gone up:
c5940	he stooped down,
c5941	he couched as a lion, and as an old lion;
c5942	who shall rouse him up?
c5943	The sceptre shall not depart from Judah,
c5944	nor a lawgiver from between his feet,
c5945	until Shiloh come;
c5946	and unto him <i>shall</i> the gathering of the people <i>be.</i>
c5947	Binding his foal unto the vine,
c5948	and his ass's colt unto the choice vine;
c5949	he washed his garments in wine,
c5950	and his clothes in the blood of grapes:
c5951	His eyes <i>shall be</i> red with wine,
c5952	and his teeth white with milk.
c5953	Zebulun
c5954	shall dwell at the haven of the sea;
c5955	and he <i>shall be</i> for an haven of ships;
c5956	and his border <i>shall be</i> unto Zidon.
c5957	Issachar <i>is</i> a strong ass
c5958	couching down between two burdens:
c5959	And he saw that rest
c5960	<i>was</i> good,
c5961	and the land
c5962	that <i>it was</i> pleasant;
c5963	and bowed his shoulder
c5964	to bear,
c5965	and became a servant unto tribute.
c5966	Dan shall judge his people, as one of the tribes of Israel.
c5967	Dan shall be a serpent by the way,
c5968	an adder in the path,
c5969	that biteth the horse heels,
c5970	so that his rider shall fall backward.
c5971	I have waited for thy salvation,
c5972	O LORD.
c5973	Gad,
c5974	a troop shall overcome
c5975	him: but he shall overcome at the last.
c5976	Out of Asher
c5977	his bread <i>shall be</i> fat,
c5978	and he shall yield royal dainties.
c5979	Naphtali <i>is</i> a hind let loose:
c5980	he giveth goodly words.
c5981	Joseph <i>is</i> a fruitful bough,
c5982	<i>even</i> a fruitful bough by a well;
c5983	<i>whose</i> branches
c5984	run over the wall:
c5986	him, and shot <i>at him,</i> and hated him:
c5987	The archers have sorely grieved
c5988	But his bow abode in strength,
c5989	and the arms of his hands were made strong by the hands of the mighty <i>God</i> of Jacob;
c5990	(from thence <i>is</i> the shepherd, the stone of Israel:)
c5991	<i>Even</i> by the God of thy father,
c5992	who shall help
c5993	thee; and by the Almighty,
c5994	who shall bless thee with blessings of heaven above, blessings of the deep
c5995	that lieth under,
c5996	blessings of the breasts, and of the womb:
c5997	The blessings of thy father have prevailed above the blessings of my progenitors unto the utmost bound of the everlasting hills:
c5998	they shall be on the head of Joseph, and on the crown of the head of him that was separate from his brethren.
c5999	Benjamin shall ravin <i>as</i> a wolf:
c6001	in the morning he shall devour the prey,
c6002	and at night he shall divide the spoil.
c6003	All these <i>are</i> the twelve tribes of Israel:
c6004	and this
c6005	<i>is it</i> that their father spake
c6006	unto them, and blessed them;
c6007	every one
c6008	according to his blessing
c6009	he blessed them.
c6010	And he charged
c6011	them, and said unto
c6012	them, I am to be gathered unto my people:
c6013	bury me with my fathers in the cave
c6014	that <i>is</i> in the field of Ephron the Hittite,
c6015	In the cave
c6016	that <i>is</i> in the field of Machpelah,
c6017	which <i>is</i> before Mamre, in the land of Canaan,
c6018	which Abraham bought with the field of Ephron the Hittite for a possession of a buryingplace.
c6019	There they buried Abraham and Sarah his wife;
c6020	there they buried Isaac and Rebekah his wife;
c6021	and there I buried Leah.
c6022	The purchase of the field and of the cave
c6023	that
c6024	<i>is</i> therein <i>was</i> from the children of Heth.
c6025	And when Jacob had made an end
c6026	of commanding his sons,
c6027	he gathered up his feet into the bed,
c6028	and yielded up the ghost,
c6029	and was gathered unto his people.
c6030	And Joseph fell upon his father's face,
c6031	and wept upon
c6032	him, and kissed him.
c6033	And Joseph commanded his servants the physicians
c6034	to embalm his father:
c6035	and the physicians embalmed Israel.
c6036	And forty days were fulfilled
c6037	for him; for so are fulfilled the days of those which are embalmed:
c6038	and the Egyptians mourned for him threescore and ten days.
c6039	And when the days of his mourning were past,
c6040	Joseph spake unto the house of Pharaoh,
c6041	saying,
c6042	If now I have found grace in your eyes,
c6043	speak, I pray you, in the ears of Pharaoh,
c6044	saying,
c6045	My father made me swear,
c6046	saying,
c6047	Lo, I die:
c6048	in my grave
c6049	which I have digged for me in the land of Canaan,
c6050	there shalt thou bury
c6051	me. Now
c6052	therefore let me go up, I pray thee,
c6053	and bury my father,
c6054	and I will come again.
c6055	And Pharaoh said,
c6056	Go up,
c6057	and bury thy father,
c6058	according as he made thee swear.
c6059	And Joseph went up
c6060	to bury his father:
c6061	and with him went up all the servants of Pharaoh, the elders of his house, and all the elders of the land of Egypt,
c6062	And all the house of Joseph, and his brethren, and his father's house:
c6063	only their little ones, and their flocks, and their herds, they left in the land of Goshen.
c6064	And there went up with him both chariots and horsemen:
c6065	and it was a very great company.
c6066	And they came to the threshingfloor of Atad,
c6067	which <i>is</i> beyond Jordan,
c6068	and there they mourned with a great and very sore lamentation:
c6069	and he made a mourning for his father seven days.
c6070	And when the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, saw the mourning in the floor of Atad,
c6071	they said,
c6072	This <i>is</i> a grievous mourning to the Egyptians:
c6073	wherefore the name of it was called Abelmizraim,
c6074	which <i>is</i> beyond Jordan.
c6075	And his sons did unto him according as
c6076	he commanded them:
c6077	For his sons carried him into the land of Canaan, and buried him in the cave of the field of Machpelah,
c6079	which Abraham bought with the field for a possession of a buryingplace of Ephron the Hittite,
c6080	before Mamre.
c6081	And Joseph returned into Egypt, he, and his brethren, and all
c6082	that went up with
c6083	him to bury his father,
c6084	after he had buried his father.
c6085	And when Joseph's brethren saw
c6086	that their father was dead,
c6087	they said,
c6088	Joseph will peradventure hate
c6089	us, and will certainly requite us all the evil
c6090	which we did unto him.
c6091	And they sent a messenger unto Joseph,
c6092	saying,
c6093	Thy father did command before he died,
c6094	saying,
c6095	So shall ye say unto Joseph,
c6096	Forgive, I pray thee now, the trespass of thy brethren, and their sin;
c6097	for they did unto thee evil:
c6098	and now,
c6099	we pray thee, forgive the trespass of the servants of the God of thy father.
c6100	And Joseph wept
c6101	when they spake unto him.
c6102	And his brethren also went
c6103	and fell down before his face;
c6104	and they said,
c6105	Behold, we <i>be</i> thy servants.
c6106	And Joseph said unto
c6107	them, Fear not:
c6108	for
c6109	<i>am</i> I in the place of God?
c6110	But as for you, ye thought evil against
c6111	me; <i>but</i> God meant it unto good,
c6112	to bring to pass, as <i>it is</i> this day,
c6113	to save much people alive.
c6114	Now
c6115	therefore fear ye not:
c6116	I will nourish you, and your little ones.
c6117	And he comforted
c6118	them, and spake kindly unto them.
c6119	And Joseph dwelt in Egypt, he, and his father's house:
c6120	and Joseph lived an hundred and ten years.
c6121	And Joseph saw Ephraim's children of the third
c6122	<i>generation:</i> the children also of Machir the son of Manasseh were brought up upon Joseph's knees.
c6123	And Joseph said unto his brethren,
c6124	I die:
c6125	and God will surely visit
c6126	you, and bring you out of this land unto the land
c6127	which he sware to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.
c6128	And Joseph took an oath of the children of Israel,
c6129	saying,
c6130	God will surely visit
c6131	you, and ye shall carry up my bones from hence.
c6132	So Joseph died, <i>being</i> an hundred and ten years old:
c6133	and they embalmed
c6134	him, and he was put in a coffin in Egypt.
c6135	Now these <i>are</i> the names of the children of Israel,
c6136	which came into Egypt; every man and his household came with Jacob.
c6138	Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah,
c6139	Issachar, Zebulun, and Benjamin,
c6140	Dan, and Naphtali, Gad, and Asher.
c6141	And all the souls that came out of the loins of Jacob were seventy souls:
c6142	for Joseph was in Egypt <i>already.</i>
c6143	And Joseph died, and all his brethren, and all that generation.
c6144	And the children of Israel were fruitful,
c6145	and increased abundantly,
c6146	and multiplied,
c6147	and waxed exceeding mighty;
c6148	and the land was filled with them.
c6149	Now there arose up a new king over Egypt,
c6150	which knew not Joseph.
c6151	And he said unto his people,
c6152	Behold, the people of the children of Israel <i>are</i> more and mightier than we:
c6153	Come
c6154	on, let us deal wisely
c6155	with them; lest they multiply,
c6156	and it come to pass,
c6157	that, when there falleth out any war,
c6158	they join also unto our enemies,
c6159	and fight
c6160	against us, and <i>so</i> get them up out of the land.
c6161	Therefore they did set over them taskmasters
c6162	to afflict them with their burdens.
c6163	And they built for Pharaoh treasure cities, Pithom and Raamses.
c6164	But the more they afflicted
c6165	them, the more they multiplied
c6166	and grew.
c6167	And they were grieved because of the children of Israel.
c6168	And the Egyptians made the children of Israel to serve with rigour:
c6169	And they made their lives bitter with hard bondage, in morter, and in brick, and in all manner of service in the field:
c6170	all their service,
c6171	wherein they made them serve,
c6172	<i>was</i> with rigour.
c6173	And the king of Egypt spake to the Hebrew midwives,
c6174	of which the name of the one <i>was</i> Shiphrah,
c6175	and the name of the other Puah:
c6176	And he said,
c6177	When ye do the office of a midwife to the Hebrew women,
c6178	and see <i>them</i> upon the stools;
c6179	if it <i>be</i> a son,
c6180	then ye shall kill
c6181	him: but if it <i>be</i> a daughter,
c6182	then she shall live.
c6183	But the midwives feared God,
c6184	and did not
c6185	as the king of Egypt commanded
c6186	them, but saved the men children alive.
c6187	And the king of Egypt called for the midwives,
c6188	and said
c6189	unto them, Why have ye done this thing,
c6190	and have saved the men children alive?
c6191	And the midwives said unto Pharaoh,
c6192	Because the Hebrew women <i>are</i> not as the Egyptian women;
c6193	for they <i>are</i> lively,
c6194	and are delivered ere the midwives come in unto them.
c6196	Therefore God dealt well with the midwives:
c6197	and the people multiplied,
c6198	and waxed very mighty.
c6199	And it came to pass,
c6200	because the midwives feared God,
c6201	that he made them houses.
c6202	And Pharaoh charged all his people,
c6203	saying,
c6204	Every son that is born
c6205	ye shall cast into the river,
c6206	and every daughter ye shall save alive.
c6207	And there went a man of the house of Levi,
c6208	and took <i>to wife</i> a daughter of Levi.
c6209	And the woman conceived,
c6210	and bare a son:
c6211	and when she saw
c6212	him that he <i>was a</i> goodly
c6213	<i>child,</i> she hid him three months.
c6214	And when she could not longer
c6215	hide
c6216	him, she took for him an ark of bulrushes,
c6217	and daubed it with slime and with pitch,
c6218	and put the child
c6219	therein; and she laid <i>it</i> in the flags by the river's brink.
c6220	And his sister stood afar off,
c6221	to wit
c6222	what would be done to him.
c6223	And the daughter of Pharaoh came down
c6224	to wash
c6225	<i>herself</i> at the river;
c6226	and her maidens walked along by the river's side;
c6227	and when she saw the ark among the flags,
c6228	she sent her maid
c6229	to fetch it.
c6230	And when she had opened
c6231	<i>it,</i> she saw the child:
c6232	and, behold, the babe wept.
c6233	And she had compassion on
c6234	him, and said,
c6235	This <i>is one</i> of the Hebrews' children.
c6236	Then said his sister to Pharaoh's daughter,
c6237	Shall I go
c6238	and call to thee a nurse of the Hebrew women,
c6239	that she may nurse the child for thee?
c6240	And Pharaoh's daughter said
c6241	to her, Go.
c6242	And the maid went
c6243	and called the child's mother.
c6244	And Pharaoh's daughter said
c6245	unto her, Take this child away,
c6246	and nurse
c6247	it for me, and I will give <i>thee</i> thy wages.
c6248	And the woman took the child,
c6249	and nursed it.
c6250	And the child grew,
c6251	and she brought him unto Pharaoh's daughter,
c6252	and he became her son.
c6253	And she called his name Moses:
c6254	and she said,
c6255	Because I drew him out of the water.
c6256	And it came to pass in those days,
c6257	when Moses was grown,
c6258	that he went out unto his brethren,
c6259	and looked on their burdens:
c6260	and he spied an Egyptian
c6261	smiting an Hebrew, one of his brethren.
c6262	And he looked this way and that way,
c6263	and when he saw
c6264	that <i>there was</i> no man,
c6265	he slew the Egyptian,
c6266	and hid him in the sand.
c6267	And when he went out the second day,
c6268	behold,
c6269	two men of the Hebrews strove together:
c6270	and he said to him that did the wrong,
c6271	Wherefore smitest thou thy fellow?
c6272	And he said,
c6273	Who made thee a prince and a judge over
c6275	to kill
c6276	us? intendest thou
c6277	me, as thou killedst the Egyptian?
c6278	And Moses feared,
c6279	and said,
c6280	Surely this thing is known.
c6281	Now when Pharaoh heard this thing,
c6282	he sought
c6283	to slay Moses.
c6284	But Moses fled from the face of Pharaoh,
c6285	and dwelt in the land of Midian:
c6286	and he sat down by a well.
c6287	Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters:
c6288	and they came
c6289	and drew
c6290	<i>water,</i> and filled the troughs
c6291	to water their father's flock.
c6292	And the shepherds came
c6293	and drove them away:
c6294	but Moses stood up
c6295	and helped
c6296	them, and watered their flock.
c6297	And when they came to Reuel their father,
c6298	he said,
c6299	How <i>is it that</i> ye are come so soon
c6301	to day?
c6302	And they said,
c6303	An Egyptian delivered us out of the hand of the shepherds,
c6304	and also drew <i>water</i> enough
c6305	for us, and watered the flock.
c6306	And he said unto his daughters,
c6307	And where
c6308	<i>is</i> he? why <i>is</i> it <i>that</i> ye have left the man?
c6309	call
c6310	him, that he may eat bread.
c6311	And Moses was content
c6312	to dwell with the man:
c6313	and he gave Moses Zipporah his daughter.
c6314	And she bare <i>him</i> a son,
c6315	and he called his name Gershom:
c6316	for he said,
c6317	I have been a stranger in a strange land.
c6318	And it came to pass in process of time,
c6319	that the king of Egypt died:
c6320	and the children of Israel sighed by reason of the bondage,
c6321	and they cried,
c6322	and their cry came up unto God by reason of the bondage.
c6323	And God heard their groaning,
c6324	and God remembered his covenant with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob.
c6325	And God looked upon the children of Israel,
c6326	and God had respect unto <i>them.</i>
c6327	Now Moses kept the flock of Jethro his father in law, the priest of Midian:
c6328	and he led the flock to the backside of the desert,
c6329	and came to the mountain of God, <i>even</i> to Horeb.
c6330	And the angel of the LORD appeared unto him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush:
c6331	and he looked,
c6332	and, behold,
c6333	the bush burned with fire,
c6334	and the bush
c6335	<i>was</i> not consumed.
c6336	And Moses said,
c6337	I will now turn aside,
c6338	and see this great sight,
c6339	why the bush is not burnt.
c6340	And when the LORD saw
c6341	that he turned aside
c6342	to see,
c6343	God called unto him out of the midst of the bush,
c6344	and said,
c6345	Moses, Moses.
c6346	And he said,
c6347	Here <i>am</i> I.
c6348	And he said,
c6349	Draw not nigh hither:
c6350	put off thy shoes from off thy feet,
c6351	for the place
c6352	whereon thou standest
c6353	<i>is</i> holy ground.
c6354	Moreover he said,
c6355	I <i>am</i> the God of thy father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.
c6356	And Moses hid his face;
c6357	for he was afraid
c6358	to look upon God.
c6359	And the LORD said,
c6360	I have surely seen the affliction of my people
c6361	which <i>are</i> in Egypt,
c6362	and have heard their cry by reason of their taskmasters;
c6363	for I know their sorrows;
c6364	And I am come down
c6365	to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians,
c6366	and to bring them up out of that land unto a good land and a large, unto a land flowing with milk and honey; unto the place of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites.
c6367	Now
c6368	therefore, behold, the cry of the children of Israel is come unto
c6369	me: and I have also seen the oppression
c6370	wherewith the Egyptians oppress them.
c6371	now
c6372	Come
c6373	therefore, and I will send thee unto Pharaoh,
c6374	that thou mayest bring forth my people the children of Israel out of Egypt.
c6375	And Moses said unto God,
c6376	Who <i>am</i> I,
c6377	that I should go unto Pharaoh,
c6378	and that I should bring forth the children of Israel out of Egypt?
c6379	And he said,
c6380	Certainly I will be with
c6381	thee; and this <i>shall be</i> a token
c6382	unto thee, that I have sent
c6383	thee: When thou hast brought forth the people out of Egypt,
c6384	ye shall serve God upon this mountain.
c6385	And Moses said unto God,
c6386	Behold, <i>when</i> I come unto the children of Israel,
c6387	and shall say
c6388	unto them, The God of your fathers hath sent me unto
c6389	you; and they shall say
c6390	to me, What <i>is</i> his name?
c6391	what shall I say unto them?
c6392	And God said unto Moses,
c6393	I AM
c6394	THAT I AM:
c6395	and he said,
c6396	Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel,
c6397	I AM
c6398	hath sent me unto you.
c6399	And God said moreover unto Moses,
c6400	Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel,
c6401	The LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath sent me unto
c6402	you: this <i>is</i> my name for ever,
c6403	and this <i>is</i> my memorial unto all generations.
c6404	Go,
c6405	and gather the elders of Israel
c6406	together, and say unto
c6407	them, The LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob, appeared unto
c6409	me, saying,
c6410	I have surely visited
c6411	you, and <i>seen</i> that which is done to you in Egypt:
c6412	And I have said,
c6413	I will bring you up out of the affliction of Egypt unto the land of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, unto a land flowing with milk and honey.
c6414	And they shall hearken to thy voice:
c6415	and thou shalt come, thou and the elders of Israel, unto the king of Egypt,
c6416	and ye shall say unto
c6417	him, The LORD God of the Hebrews hath met with
c6418	us: and now
c6419	let us go, we beseech thee, three days' journey into the wilderness,
c6420	that we may sacrifice to the LORD our God.
c6421	And I am sure
c6422	that the king of Egypt will not let
c6423	you go,
c6424	no, not by a mighty hand.
c6425	And I will stretch out my hand,
c6426	and smite Egypt with all my wonders
c6427	which I will do in the midst
c6428	thereof: and after that he will let you go.
c6429	And I will give this people favour in the sight of the Egyptians:
c6430	and it shall come to pass,
c6431	that, when ye go,
c6432	ye shall not go empty:
c6433	But every woman shall borrow of her neighbour, and of her that sojourneth in her house, jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment:
c6434	and ye shall put <i>them</i> upon your sons, and upon your daughters;
c6435	and ye shall spoil the Egyptians.
c6436	And Moses answered
c6437	and said,
c6438	But, behold,
c6439	they will not believe
c6440	me, nor hearken unto my voice:
c6441	for they will say,
c6442	The LORD hath not appeared unto thee.
c6443	And the LORD said unto
c6444	him, What <i>is</i> that in thine hand?
c6445	And he said,
c6446	A rod.
c6447	And he said,
c6448	Cast it on the ground.
c6449	And he cast it on the ground,
c6450	and it became a serpent;
c6451	and Moses fled from before it.
c6452	And the LORD said unto Moses,
c6453	Put forth thine hand,
c6454	and take it by the tail.
c6455	And he put forth his hand,
c6456	and caught
c6457	it, and it became a rod in his hand:
c6458	That they may believe
c6459	that the LORD God of their fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath appeared unto thee.
c6460	And the LORD said furthermore
c6461	unto him, Put now thine hand into thy bosom.
c6462	And he put his hand into his bosom:
c6463	and when he took it out,
c6464	behold,
c6465	his hand <i>was</i> leprous as snow.
c6466	And he said,
c6467	Put thine hand into thy bosom
c6468	again. And he put his hand into his bosom
c6469	again; and plucked it out of his bosom,
c6470	and, behold,
c6471	it was turned again as his <i>other</i> flesh.
c6472	And it shall come to pass,
c6473	if they will not believe
c6474	thee, neither hearken to the voice of the first sign,
c6475	that they will believe the voice of the latter sign.
c6476	And it shall come to pass,
c6477	if they will not believe also these two signs,
c6478	neither hearken unto thy voice,
c6479	that thou shalt take of the water of the river,
c6480	and pour <i>it</i> upon the dry
c6481	<i>land:</i> and the water which thou takest out of the river shall become
c6483	blood upon the dry <i>land.</i>
c6484	And Moses said unto the LORD,
c6485	O my Lord,
c6486	I <i>am</i> not eloquent, neither heretofore, nor since
c6487	thou hast spoken unto thy servant:
c6488	but I <i>am</i> slow of speech, and of a slow tongue.
c6489	And the LORD said unto
c6490	him, Who hath made man's mouth?
c6491	or who maketh the dumb, or deaf, or the seeing, or the blind?
c6492	have not I the LORD?
c6493	Now
c6494	therefore go,
c6495	and I will be with thy mouth,
c6496	and teach
c6497	thee what thou shalt say.
c6498	And he said,
c6499	O my Lord,
c6500	send, I pray thee, by the hand
c6501	<i>of him whom</i> thou wilt send.
c6502	And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Moses,
c6503	and he said,
c6504	<i>Is</i> not Aaron the Levite thy brother?
c6505	I know
c6506	that he can speak well.
c6507	And also, behold,
c6508	he cometh forth
c6509	to meet
c6510	thee: and when he seeth
c6511	thee, he will be glad in his heart.
c6512	And thou shalt speak unto
c6513	him, and put words in his mouth:
c6514	and I will be with thy mouth, and with his mouth,
c6515	and will teach
c6516	you what ye shall do.
c6517	And he shall be thy spokesman unto the people:
c6518	and he shall be,
c6519	<i>even</i> he shall be to thee instead of a mouth,
c6520	and thou shalt be to him instead of God.
c6521	And thou shalt take this rod in thine hand,
c6522	wherewith thou shalt do signs.
c6523	And Moses went
c6524	and returned to Jethro his father in law,
c6525	and said
c6526	unto him, Let me go, I pray thee,
c6527	and return unto my brethren
c6528	which <i>are</i> in Egypt,
c6529	and see
c6530	whether they be yet alive.
c6531	And Jethro said to Moses,
c6532	Go in peace.
c6533	And the LORD said unto Moses in Midian,
c6534	Go,
c6535	return into Egypt:
c6536	for all the men are dead
c6537	which sought thy life.
c6538	And Moses took his wife and his sons,
c6539	and set them upon an ass,
c6540	and he returned to the land of Egypt:
c6541	and Moses took the rod of God in his hand.
c6542	And the LORD said unto Moses,
c6543	When thou goest
c6544	to return into Egypt,
c6545	see that thou do all those wonders
c6546	which I have put in thine hand:
c6547	before Pharaoh,
c6548	but I will harden his heart,
c6549	that he shall not let the people go.
c6550	And thou shalt say unto Pharaoh,
c6551	Thus saith the LORD,
c6552	Israel <i>is</i> my son, <i>even</i> my firstborn:
c6553	And I say unto
c6554	thee, Let my son go,
c6555	that he may serve
c6556	me: and if thou refuse
c6557	to let him go,
c6558	behold, I will slay thy son, <i>even</i> thy firstborn.
c6559	And it came to pass by the way in the inn,
c6560	that the LORD met
c6561	him, and sought
c6562	to kill him.
c6563	Then Zipporah took a sharp stone,
c6564	and cut off the foreskin of her son,
c6565	and cast <i>it</i> at his feet,
c6566	and said,
c6567	Surely a bloody husband <i>art</i> thou to me.
c6568	So he let him go:
c6569	then she said,
c6570	A bloody husband
c6571	<i>thou art,</i> because of the circumcision.
c6572	And the LORD said to Aaron,
c6573	Go
c6574	into the wilderness to meet Moses.
c6575	And he went,
c6576	and met him in the mount of God,
c6577	and kissed him.
c6578	And Moses told Aaron all the words of the LORD
c6579	who had sent
c6580	him, and all the signs
c6581	which he had commanded him.
c6582	And Moses and Aaron went
c6583	and gathered together all the elders of the children of Israel:
c6584	And Aaron spake all the words
c6585	which the LORD had spoken unto Moses,
c6586	and did the signs in the sight of the people.
c6587	And the people believed:
c6588	and when they heard
c6589	that the LORD had visited the children of Israel,
c6590	and that he had looked upon their affliction,
c6591	then they bowed their heads
c6592	and worshipped.
c6593	And afterward Moses and Aaron went in,
c6594	and told Pharaoh,
c6595	Thus saith the LORD God of Israel,
c6596	Let my people go,
c6597	that they may hold a feast unto me in the wilderness.
c6598	And Pharaoh said,
c6599	Who <i>is</i> the LORD,
c6600	that I should obey his voice
c6601	to let Israel go?
c6602	I know not the LORD,
c6603	neither will I let Israel go.
c6604	And they said,
c6605	The God of the Hebrews hath met with
c6606	us: let us go, we pray thee, three days' journey into the desert,
c6607	and sacrifice unto the LORD our God;
c6608	lest he fall upon us with pestilence, or with the sword.
c6609	And the king of Egypt said unto
c6610	them, Wherefore
c6611	do ye, Moses and Aaron,
c6612	let the people from their works?
c6613	get you unto your burdens.
c6614	And Pharaoh said,
c6615	Behold, the people of the land now <i>are</i> many,
c6616	and ye make them rest from their burdens.
c6617	And Pharaoh commanded the same day the taskmasters of the people, and their officers,
c6618	saying,
c6619	Ye shall no more
c6620	give the people straw
c6621	to make brick,
c6622	as heretofore:
c6623	let them go
c6624	and gather straw for themselves.
c6625	And the tale of the bricks,
c6626	which they did make heretofore,
c6627	ye shall lay upon
c6628	them; ye shall not diminish <i>ought</i> thereof:
c6629	for they <i>be</i> idle;
c6630	therefore they cry,
c6631	saying,
c6632	Let us go
c6633	<i>and</i> sacrifice to our God.
c6634	Let there more work be laid upon the men,
c6635	that they may labour
c6636	therein; and let them not regard vain words.
c6637	And the taskmasters of the people went out, and their officers,
c6638	and they spake to the people,
c6639	saying,
c6640	Thus saith Pharaoh,
c6641	I will not give you straw.
c6642	Go ye,
c6643	get you straw
c6644	where ye can find
c6645	it: yet not ought of your work shall be diminished.
c6646	So the people were scattered abroad throughout all the land of Egypt
c6647	to gather stubble instead of straw.
c6648	And the taskmasters hasted
c6649	<i>them,</i> saying,
c6650	Fulfil your works, <i>your</i> daily tasks,
c6651	as when there was straw.
c6652	And the officers of the children of Israel, which Pharaoh's taskmasters had set over them, were beaten,
c6654	<i>and</i> demanded,
c6655	Wherefore have ye not fulfilled your task
c6656	in making brick both yesterday
c6657	and to day, as heretofore?
c6658	Then the officers of the children of Israel came
c6659	and cried unto Pharaoh,
c6660	saying,
c6661	Wherefore dealest thou thus with thy servants?
c6662	There is no straw given unto thy servants,
c6663	brick:
c6664	and they say
c6665	to us, Make
c6666	and, behold, thy servants <i>are</i> beaten;
c6667	but the fault <i>is</i> in thine own people.
c6668	But he said,
c6669	Ye <i>are</i> idle,
c6670	<i>ye are</i> idle:
c6671	therefore ye say,
c6672	Let us go
c6673	<i>and</i> do sacrifice to the LORD.
c6674	therefore now,
c6675	Go
c6676	<i>and</i> work;
c6677	for there shall no straw be given
c6678	you, yet shall ye deliver the tale of bricks.
c6679	And the officers of the children of Israel did see <i>that</i> they <i>were</i> in evil
c6680	<i>case,</i> after it was said,
c6681	Ye shall not minish <i>ought</i> from your bricks of your daily task.
c6682	And they met Moses and Aaron,
c6683	who stood
c6684	in the way,
c6685	as they came forth from Pharaoh:
c6686	And they said unto
c6687	them, The LORD look upon
c6688	you, and judge;
c6689	because ye have made our savour to be abhorred in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of his servants,
c6690	to put a sword in their hand
c6691	to slay us.
c6692	And Moses returned unto the LORD,
c6693	and said,
c6694	Lord,
c6695	wherefore hast thou <i>so</i> evil entreated this people?
c6696	why <i>is</i> it <i>that</i> thou hast sent me?
c6697	For since I came to Pharaoh
c6698	to speak in thy name,
c6699	he hath done evil to this people;
c6700	neither hast thou delivered thy people at all.
c6701	Then the LORD said unto Moses,
c6702	Now shalt thou see
c6703	what I will do to Pharaoh:
c6704	for with a strong hand shall he let them go,
c6705	and with a strong hand shall he drive them out of his land.
c6706	And God spake unto Moses,
c6707	and said unto
c6708	him, I <i>am</i> the LORD:
c6709	And I appeared unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, by <i>the name of</i> God Almighty,
c6710	but by my name JEHOVAH
c6711	was I not known to them.
c6712	And I have also established my covenant with
c6713	them, to give them the land of Canaan, the land of their pilgrimage,
c6714	wherein they were strangers.
c6715	And I have also heard the groaning of the children of Israel,
c6716	whom the Egyptians keep in bondage;
c6717	and I have remembered my covenant.
c6718	Wherefore
c6719	say unto the children of Israel,
c6720	I <i>am</i> the LORD,
c6721	and I will bring you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians,
c6722	and I will rid you out of their bondage,
c6723	and I will redeem you with a stretched out arm, and with great judgments:
c6724	And I will take you to me for a people,
c6725	and I will be to you a God:
c6726	and ye shall know
c6727	that I <i>am</i> the LORD your God,
c6728	which bringeth you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians.
c6729	And I will bring you in unto the land,
c6730	concerning the which I did swear
c6731	to give it to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob;
c6732	and I will give it you for an heritage:
c6733	I <i>am</i> the LORD.
c6734	And Moses spake so unto the children of Israel:
c6735	but they hearkened not unto Moses for anguish of spirit, and for cruel bondage.
c6736	And the LORD spake unto Moses,
c6737	saying,
c6738	Go in,
c6739	speak unto Pharaoh king of Egypt,
c6740	that he let the children of Israel go out of his land.
c6741	And Moses spake before the LORD,
c6742	saying,
c6743	Behold,
c6744	the children of Israel have not hearkened unto
c6745	me; how then shall Pharaoh hear
c6746	me, who <i>am</i> of uncircumcised lips?
c6747	And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron,
c6748	and gave them a charge unto the children of Israel, and unto Pharaoh king of Egypt,
c6749	to bring the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt.
c6750	These <i>be</i> the heads of their fathers' houses:
c6751	The sons of Reuben the firstborn of Israel; Hanoch, and Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi:
c6752	these <i>be</i> the families of Reuben.
c6753	And the sons of Simeon; Jemuel, and Jamin, and Ohad, and Jachin, and Zohar, and Shaul the son of a Canaanitish woman:
c6754	these <i>are</i> the families of Simeon.
c6755	And these <i>are</i> the names of the sons of Levi according to their generations;
c6756	Gershon, and Kohath, and Merari:
c6757	and the years of the life of Levi <i>were</i> an hundred thirty and seven years.
c6758	The sons of Gershon; Libni, and Shimi, according to their families.
c6759	And the sons of Kohath; Amram, and Izhar, and Hebron, and Uzziel:
c6760	and the years of the life of Kohath <i>were</i> an hundred thirty and three years.
c6761	And the sons of Merari; Mahali and Mushi:
c6762	these <i>are</i> the families of Levi according to their generations.
c6763	And Amram took him Jochebed his father's sister to wife;
c6764	and she bare him Aaron and Moses:
c6765	and the years of the life of Amram <i>were</i> an hundred and thirty and seven years.
c6766	And the sons of Izhar; Korah, and Nepheg, and Zichri.
c6767	And the sons of Uzziel; Mishael, and Elzaphan, and Zithri.
c6768	And Aaron took him Elisheba, daughter of Amminadab, sister of Naashon, to wife;
c6769	and she bare him Nadab, and Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar.
c6770	And the sons of Korah; Assir, and Elkanah, and Abiasaph:
c6771	these <i>are</i> the families of the Korhites.
c6772	And Eleazar Aaron's son took him <i>one</i> of the daughters of Putiel to wife;
c6773	and she bare him Phinehas:
c6774	these <i>are</i> the heads of the fathers of the Levites according to their families.
c6775	These <i>are</i> that Aaron and Moses,
c6776	to whom the LORD said,
c6777	Bring out the children of Israel from the land of Egypt according to their armies.
c6778	These
c6779	<i>are</i> they which spake to Pharaoh king of Egypt,
c6780	to bring out the children of Israel from Egypt:
c6781	these <i>are</i> that Moses and Aaron.
c6782	And it came to pass on the day
c6783	<i>when</i> the LORD spake unto Moses in the land of Egypt,
c6784	That the LORD spake unto Moses,
c6785	saying,
c6786	I <i>am</i> the LORD:
c6787	speak thou unto Pharaoh king of Egypt all
c6788	that I say unto thee.
c6789	And Moses said before the LORD,
c6790	Behold, I <i>am</i> of uncircumcised lips,
c6791	and how shall Pharaoh hearken unto me?
c6792	And the LORD said unto Moses,
c6793	See,
c6794	I have made thee a god to Pharaoh:
c6795	and Aaron thy brother shall be thy prophet.
c6796	Thou shalt speak all
c6797	that I command
c6798	thee: and Aaron thy brother shall speak unto Pharaoh,
c6799	that he send the children of Israel out of his land.
c6800	And I will harden Pharaoh's heart,
c6801	and multiply my signs and my wonders in the land of Egypt.
c6802	But Pharaoh shall not hearken unto
c6803	you, that I may lay my hand upon Egypt,
c6804	and bring forth mine armies, <i>and</i> my people the children of Israel, out of the land of Egypt by great judgments.
c6805	And the Egyptians shall know
c6806	that I <i>am</i> the LORD,
c6807	when I stretch forth mine hand upon Egypt,
c6808	and bring out the children of Israel from among them.
c6809	And Moses and Aaron did
c6810	as the LORD commanded
c6811	them, so did they.
c6812	And Moses <i>was</i> fourscore years old,
c6813	and Aaron fourscore and three years old,
c6814	when they spake unto Pharaoh.
c6815	And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron,
c6816	saying,
c6817	When Pharaoh shall speak unto
c6818	you, saying,
c6819	Shew a miracle
c6820	for you: then thou shalt say unto Aaron,
c6821	Take thy rod,
c6822	and cast <i>it</i> before Pharaoh,
c6823	<i>and</i> it shall become a serpent.
c6824	And Moses and Aaron went in unto Pharaoh,
c6825	and they did so
c6826	as the LORD had commanded:
c6827	and Aaron cast down his rod before Pharaoh, and before his servants,
c6828	and it became a serpent.
c6829	Then Pharaoh also called the wise men and the sorcerers:
c6830	now the magicians of Egypt, they also did in like manner with their enchantments.
c6831	For they cast down
c6832	every man his rod,
c6833	and they became serpents:
c6834	but Aaron's rod swallowed up their rods.
c6835	And he hardened Pharaoh's heart,
c6836	that he hearkened not unto
c6837	them; as the LORD had said.
c6838	And the LORD said unto Moses,
c6839	Pharaoh's heart <i>is</i> hardened,
c6840	he refuseth
c6841	to let the people go.
c6842	Get thee unto Pharaoh in the morning;
c6843	lo, he goeth out unto the water;
c6844	and thou shalt stand
c6845	against he come;
c6846	by the river's brink
c6847	and the rod
c6848	which was turned to a serpent
c6849	shalt thou take in thine hand.
c6850	And thou shalt say unto
c6851	him, The LORD God of the Hebrews hath sent me unto
c6852	thee, saying,
c6853	Let my people go,
c6854	that they may serve me in the wilderness:
c6855	and, behold,
c6856	hitherto thou wouldest not hear.
c6857	Thus saith the LORD,
c6858	In this thou shalt know
c6859	that I <i>am</i> the LORD:
c6860	behold,
c6861	I will smite with the rod
c6862	that <i>is</i> in mine hand
c6863	upon the waters
c6864	which <i>are</i> in the river,
c6865	and they shall be turned to blood.
c6866	And the fish
c6867	that <i>is</i> in the river
c6868	shall die,
c6869	and the river shall stink;
c6870	and the Egyptians shall lothe
c6871	to drink of the water of the river.
c6872	And the LORD spake unto Moses,
c6873	Say unto Aaron,
c6874	Take thy rod,
c6875	and stretch out thine hand upon the waters of Egypt, upon their streams, upon their rivers, and upon their ponds, and upon all their pools of water,
c6876	that they may become blood;
c6877	and <i>that</i> there may be blood throughout all the land of Egypt, both in <i>vessels of</i> wood, and in <i>vessels of</i> stone.
c6878	And Moses and Aaron did so,
c6879	as the LORD commanded;
c6880	and he lifted up the rod,
c6881	and smote the waters
c6882	that <i>were</i> in the river, in the sight of Pharaoh, and in the sight of his servants;
c6883	and all the waters that <i>were</i> in the river were turned
c6885	to blood.
c6886	And the fish
c6887	that <i>was</i> in the river
c6888	died;
c6889	and the river stank,
c6890	of Egypt.
c6891	drink of the water of the river; and there was blood throughout all the land
c6892	and the Egyptians could not
c6893	And the magicians of Egypt did so with their enchantments:
c6894	and Pharaoh's heart was hardened,
c6895	neither did he hearken unto
c6896	them; as the LORD had said.
c6897	And Pharaoh turned
c6898	and went into his house,
c6899	neither did he set his heart to this also.
c6900	And all the Egyptians digged round about the river for water
c6901	to drink;
c6902	for they could not
c6903	drink of the water of the river.
c6904	And seven days were fulfilled,
c6905	after that the LORD had smitten the river.
c6906	And the LORD spake unto Moses,
c6907	Go unto Pharaoh,
c6908	and say unto
c6909	him, Thus saith the LORD,
c6910	Let my people go,
c6911	that they may serve me.
c6912	And if thou refuse
c6913	to let <i>them</i> go,
c6914	behold, I will smite all thy borders with frogs:
c6915	And the river shall bring forth frogs abundantly,
c6916	which shall go up
c6917	and come into thine house, and into thy bedchamber, and upon thy bed, and into the house of thy servants, and upon thy people, and into thine ovens, and into thy kneadingtroughs:
c6918	And the frogs shall come up both on thee, and upon thy people, and upon all thy servants.
c6919	And the LORD spake unto Moses,
c6920	Say unto Aaron,
c6921	Stretch forth thine hand with thy rod over the streams, over the rivers, and over the ponds,
c6922	and cause frogs to come up upon the land of Egypt.
c6923	And Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt;
c6924	and the frogs came up,
c6925	and covered the land of Egypt.
c6926	And the magicians did so with their enchantments,
c6927	and brought up frogs upon the land of Egypt.
c6928	Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron,
c6929	and said,
c6930	Intreat the LORD,
c6931	that he may take away the frogs from me, and from my people;
c6932	and I will let the people go,
c6933	that they may do sacrifice unto the LORD.
c6934	And Moses said unto Pharaoh,
c6935	Glory over
c6936	me: when shall I intreat for thee, and for thy servants, and for thy people,
c6937	to destroy the frogs from thee and thy houses,
c6938	<i>that</i> they may remain in the river only?
c6939	And he said,
c6940	To morrow.
c6941	And he said,
c6942	<i>Be it</i> according to thy word:
c6943	that thou mayest know
c6944	that <i>there is</i> none like unto the LORD our God.
c6945	And the frogs shall depart from thee, and from thy houses, and from thy servants, and from thy people;
c6946	they shall remain in the river only.
c6947	And Moses and Aaron went out from Pharaoh:
c6948	and Moses cried unto the LORD because of the frogs
c6949	which he had brought against Pharaoh.
c6950	And the LORD did according to the word of Moses;
c6951	and the frogs died out of the houses, out of the villages, and out of the fields.
c6952	And they gathered them together upon heaps:
c6953	and the land stank.
c6954	But when Pharaoh saw
c6955	that there was respite,
c6956	he hardened his heart,
c6957	and hearkened not unto
c6958	them; as the LORD had said.
c6959	And the LORD said unto Moses,
c6960	Say unto Aaron,
c6961	Stretch out thy rod,
c6962	and smite the dust of the land,
c6963	that it may become lice throughout all the land of Egypt.
c6964	And they did so;
c6965	for Aaron stretched out his hand with his rod,
c6966	and smote the dust of the earth,
c6967	and it became lice in man, and in beast;
c6968	all the dust of the land became lice throughout all the land of Egypt.
c6969	And the magicians did so with their enchantments
c6970	to bring forth lice,
c6971	but they could not:
c6972	so there were lice upon man, and upon beast.
c6973	Then the magicians said unto Pharaoh,
c6974	This <i>is</i> the finger of God:
c6975	and Pharaoh's heart was hardened,
c6976	and he hearkened not unto
c6977	them; as the LORD had said.
c6978	And the LORD said unto Moses,
c6979	Rise up early in the morning,
c6980	and stand before Pharaoh;
c6981	lo, he cometh forth to the water;
c6982	and say unto
c6983	him, Thus saith the LORD,
c6984	Let my people go,
c6985	that they may serve me.
c6986	Else,
c6987	if thou wilt not let my people go,
c6988	behold, I will send swarms <i>of flies</i> upon thee, and upon thy servants, and upon thy people, and into thy houses:
c6989	and the houses of the Egyptians shall be full of swarms
c6990	<i>of flies,</i> and also the ground
c6991	whereon they <i>are.</i>
c6992	And I will sever in that day the land of Goshen,
c6993	in which my people dwell,
c6994	that no swarms <i>of flies</i> shall be there;
c6995	to the end thou mayest know
c6996	that I <i>am</i> the LORD in the midst of the earth.
c6997	And I will put a division between my people and thy people:
c6998	to morrow shall this sign be.
c6999	And the LORD did so;
c7000	and there came a grievous swarm <i>of flies</i> into the house of Pharaoh, and <i>into</i> his servants' houses, and into all the land of Egypt:
c7001	the land was corrupted by reason of the swarm <i>of flies.</i>
c7002	And Pharaoh called for Moses
c7003	and for Aaron,
c7004	and said,
c7005	Go
c7006	ye, sacrifice to your God in the land.
c7007	And Moses said,
c7008	It is not meet
c7009	so to do;
c7010	for we shall sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians
c7011	to the LORD our God:
c7012	lo, shall we sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians before their eyes,
c7013	and will they not stone us?
c7014	We will go three days' journey into the wilderness,
c7015	and sacrifice to the LORD our God,
c7016	as he shall command us.
c7017	And Pharaoh said,
c7018	I will let you go,
c7019	that ye may sacrifice to the LORD your God in the wilderness;
c7020	only ye shall not go very far away:
c7022	intreat for me.
c7023	And Moses said,
c7024	Behold, I go out from
c7025	thee, and I will intreat the LORD
c7026	that the swarms <i>of flies</i> may depart from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people, to morrow:
c7027	but let not Pharaoh deal deceitfully any more
c7029	in not letting the people go
c7030	to sacrifice to the LORD.
c7031	And Moses went out from Pharaoh,
c7032	and intreated the LORD.
c7033	And the LORD did according to the word of Moses;
c7034	and he removed the swarms <i>of flies</i> from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people;
c7035	there remained not one.
c7036	And Pharaoh hardened his heart at this time also,
c7037	neither would he let the people go.
c7038	Then the LORD said unto Moses,
c7039	Go in unto Pharaoh,
c7040	and tell
c7041	him, Thus saith the LORD God of the Hebrews,
c7042	Let my people go,
c7043	that they may serve me.
c7044	For
c7045	if thou refuse
c7046	to let <i>them</i> go,
c7047	and wilt hold them still,
c7048	Behold, the hand of the LORD is upon thy cattle
c7049	which <i>is</i> in the field,
c7050	upon the horses, upon the asses, upon the camels, upon the oxen, and upon the sheep:
c7051	<i>there shall be</i> a very grievous murrain.
c7052	And the LORD shall sever between the cattle of Israel and the cattle of Egypt:
c7053	and there shall nothing die of all <i>that is</i> the children's of Israel.
c7054	And the LORD appointed a set time,
c7055	saying,
c7056	To morrow the LORD shall do this thing in the land.
c7057	And the LORD did that thing on the morrow,
c7058	and all the cattle of Egypt died:
c7059	but of the cattle of the children of Israel died not one.
c7060	And Pharaoh sent,
c7061	and, behold,
c7062	there was not one of the cattle of the Israelites dead.
c7063	And the heart of Pharaoh was hardened,
c7064	and he did not let the people go.
c7065	And the LORD said unto Moses and unto Aaron,
c7066	Take to you handfuls of ashes of the furnace,
c7067	and let Moses sprinkle it toward the heaven in the sight of Pharaoh.
c7068	And it shall become small dust in all the land of Egypt,
c7069	and shall be a boil breaking forth <i>with</i> blains upon man, and upon beast,
c7071	throughout all the land of Egypt.
c7072	And they took ashes of the furnace,
c7073	and stood before Pharaoh;
c7074	and Moses sprinkled it up toward heaven;
c7075	and it became a boil
c7076	breaking forth <i>with</i> blains upon man, and upon beast.
c7077	And the magicians could not
c7078	stand before Moses
c7079	because of the boils;
c7080	for the boil was upon the magicians, and upon all the Egyptians.
c7081	And the LORD hardened the heart of Pharaoh,
c7082	and he hearkened not unto
c7083	them; as the LORD had spoken unto Moses.
c7084	And the LORD said unto Moses,
c7085	Rise up early in the morning,
c7086	and stand before Pharaoh,
c7087	and say unto
c7088	him, Thus saith the LORD God of the Hebrews,
c7089	Let my people go,
c7090	that they may serve me.
c7091	For I will at this time send all my plagues upon thine heart,
c7092	and upon thy servants, and upon thy people;
c7093	that thou mayest know
c7094	that <i>there is</i> none like me in all the earth.
c7095	For now I will stretch out my hand,
c7096	that I may smite thee and thy people with pestilence;
c7097	and thou shalt be cut off from the earth.
c7098	And in very deed
c7099	for this <i>cause</i> have I raised thee up,
c7100	for to shew <i>in</i> thee my power;
c7101	and that my name may be declared throughout all the earth.
c7102	As yet exaltest thou thyself against my people,
c7103	that thou wilt not let them go?
c7104	Behold, to morrow about this time I will cause it to rain a very grievous hail,
c7105	such as hath not been in Egypt since
c7106	the foundation
c7107	thereof even until now.
c7108	therefore now,
c7109	Send
c7110	<i>and</i> gather thy cattle, and all
c7111	that thou hast in the field;
c7112	<i>for upon</i> every man and beast
c7113	which shall be found in the field,
c7114	and shall not be brought home,
c7115	the hail shall come down upon
c7116	them, and they shall die.
c7117	He that feared the word of the LORD
c7118	among the servants of Pharaoh
c7119	made his servants and his cattle flee into the houses:
c7120	And he that regarded not the word of the LORD
c7121	left his servants and his cattle in the field.
c7122	And the LORD said unto Moses,
c7123	Stretch forth thine hand toward heaven,
c7124	that there may be hail in all the land of Egypt, upon man, and upon beast, and upon every herb of the field, throughout the land of Egypt.
c7125	And Moses stretched forth his rod toward heaven:
c7126	and the LORD sent thunder and hail,
c7127	and the fire ran along upon the ground;
c7128	and the LORD rained hail upon the land of Egypt.
c7129	So there was hail,
c7130	and fire mingled with the hail,
c7131	very grievous,
c7132	such as there was none like it in all the land of Egypt
c7133	since it became a nation.
c7134	And the hail smote throughout all the land of Egypt all
c7135	that <i>was</i> in the field,
c7136	both man and beast;
c7137	and the hail smote every herb of the field,
c7138	and brake every tree of the field.
c7139	Only in the land of Goshen,
c7140	where the children of Israel
c7141	<i>were,</i> was there no hail.
c7142	And Pharaoh sent,
c7143	and called for Moses and Aaron,
c7144	and said unto
c7145	them, I have sinned this time:
c7146	the LORD <i>is</i> righteous,
c7147	and I and my people <i>are</i> wicked.
c7148	Intreat the LORD
c7149	(for <i>it is</i> enough)
c7150	that there be no <i>more</i> mighty thunderings and hail;
c7151	and I will let you go,
c7152	no longer.
c7153	and ye shall stay
c7154	And Moses said unto
c7155	him, As soon as I am gone out of the city,
c7156	I will spread abroad my hands unto the LORD;
c7157	<i>and</i> the thunder shall cease,
c7158	neither shall there be any more hail;
c7159	that thou mayest know
c7160	how that the earth <i>is</i> the LORD'S.
c7161	But as for thee and thy servants,
c7162	I know
c7163	that ye will not yet fear the LORD God.
c7164	And the flax and the barley was smitten:
c7165	for the barley <i>was</i> in the ear,
c7166	and the flax <i>was</i> bolled.
c7167	But the wheat and the rie were not smitten:
c7168	for they <i>were</i> not grown up.
c7169	And Moses went out of the city from Pharaoh,
c7170	and spread abroad his hands unto the LORD:
c7171	and the thunders and hail ceased,
c7172	and the rain was not poured upon the earth.
c7173	And when Pharaoh saw
c7174	that the rain and the hail and the thunders were ceased,
c7175	yet more,
c7176	he sinned
c7177	and hardened his heart, he and his servants.
c7178	And the heart of Pharaoh was hardened,
c7179	neither would he let the children of Israel go;
c7180	as the LORD had spoken by Moses.
c7181	And the LORD said unto Moses,
c7182	Go in unto Pharaoh:
c7183	for I have hardened his heart, and the heart of his servants,
c7184	that I might shew these my signs before him:
c7185	And that thou mayest tell in the ears of thy son, and of thy son's son,
c7186	what things I have wrought in Egypt,
c7187	and my signs
c7188	which I have done
c7189	among them; that ye may know
c7190	how that I <i>am</i> the LORD.
c7191	And Moses and Aaron came in unto Pharaoh,
c7192	and said unto
c7193	him, Thus saith the LORD God of the Hebrews,
c7194	How long wilt thou refuse
c7195	to humble thyself before
c7196	me? let my people go,
c7197	that they may serve me.
c7198	Else,
c7199	if thou refuse
c7200	to let my people go,
c7201	behold, to morrow will I bring the locusts into thy coast:
c7202	And they shall cover the face of the earth,
c7203	that one cannot be able
c7204	to see the earth:
c7205	and they shall eat the residue of that which is escaped,
c7206	which remaineth unto you from the hail,
c7207	and shall eat every tree
c7208	which groweth for you out of the field:
c7209	And they shall fill thy houses, and the houses of all thy servants, and the houses of all the Egyptians;
c7210	which neither thy fathers, nor thy fathers' fathers have seen, since the day
c7211	that they were upon the earth
c7212	unto this day.
c7213	And he turned
c7214	himself, and went out from Pharaoh.
c7215	And Pharaoh's servants said unto
c7216	him, How long shall this man be a snare
c7217	unto us? let the men go,
c7218	that they may serve the LORD their God:
c7219	knowest thou not yet
c7220	that Egypt is destroyed?
c7221	And Moses and Aaron were brought again unto Pharaoh:
c7222	and he said unto
c7223	them, Go,
c7224	serve the LORD your God:
c7225	<i>but</i> who
c7226	<i>are</i> they that shall go?
c7227	And Moses said,
c7228	We will go with our young and with our old,
c7229	with our sons and with our daughters, with our flocks and with our herds will we go;
c7230	for we <i>must hold</i> a feast unto the LORD.
c7231	And he said unto
c7232	them, Let the LORD be so with
c7233	you, as I will let you go, and your little ones:
c7234	look
c7235	<i>to it;</i> for evil <i>is</i> before you.
c7236	Not so:
c7237	go now
c7238	ye <i>that are</i> men,
c7239	and serve the LORD;
c7240	for that ye did desire.
c7241	And they were driven out from Pharaoh's presence.
c7242	And the LORD said unto Moses,
c7243	Stretch out thine hand over the land of Egypt for the locusts,
c7244	that they may come up upon the land of Egypt,
c7245	and eat every herb of the land, <i>even</i> all
c7246	that the hail hath left.
c7247	And Moses stretched forth his rod over the land of Egypt,
c7248	and the LORD brought an east wind upon the land all that day, and all <i>that</i> night;
c7249	<i>and</i> when it was morning,
c7250	the east wind brought the locusts.
c7251	And the locusts went up over all the land of Egypt,
c7252	and rested in all the coasts of Egypt:
c7253	very grievous
c7254	<i>were they;</i> before them there were no such locusts
c7255	as they, neither after them shall be such.
c7256	For they covered the face of the whole earth,
c7257	so that the land was darkened;
c7258	and they did eat every herb of the land, and all the fruit of the trees
c7259	which the hail had left:
c7260	and there remained not any green thing in the trees, or in the herbs of the field, through all the land of Egypt.
c7261	Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron in haste;
c7263	and he said,
c7264	I have sinned against the LORD your God, and against you.
c7265	Now
c7266	therefore forgive, I pray thee, my sin only this once,
c7267	and intreat the LORD your God,
c7268	that he may take away from me this death only.
c7269	And he went out from Pharaoh,
c7270	and intreated the LORD.
c7271	And the LORD turned a mighty strong west wind,
c7272	which took away the locusts,
c7273	and cast them into the Red sea;
c7274	there remained not one locust in all the coasts of Egypt.
c7275	But the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart,
c7276	so that he would not let the children of Israel go.
c7277	And the LORD said unto Moses,
c7278	Stretch out thine hand toward heaven,
c7279	that there may be darkness over the land of Egypt,
c7280	even darkness <i>which</i> may be felt.
c7281	And Moses stretched forth his hand toward heaven;
c7282	and there was a thick darkness in all the land of Egypt three days:
c7283	They saw not
c7284	one another,
c7285	neither rose
c7286	any from his place
c7287	for three days:
c7288	but all the children of Israel had light in their dwellings.
c7289	And Pharaoh called unto Moses,
c7290	and said,
c7291	Go
c7292	ye, serve the LORD;
c7293	only let your flocks and your herds be stayed:
c7294	let your little ones also go with you.
c7295	And Moses said,
c7296	Thou must give us also sacrifices and burnt offerings,
c7297	that we may sacrifice unto the LORD our God.
c7298	Our cattle also shall go with
c7299	us; there shall not an hoof be left behind;
c7300	for thereof must we take
c7301	to serve the LORD our God;
c7302	and we know not
c7303	with what we must serve the LORD,
c7304	until we come thither.
c7305	But the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart,
c7306	and he would not
c7307	let them go.
c7308	And Pharaoh said
c7309	unto him, Get thee from
c7310	me, take heed
c7311	no more;
c7312	to thyself, see my face
c7313	for in <i>that</i> day
c7314	thou seest my face
c7315	thou shalt die.
c7316	And Moses said,
c7317	Thou hast spoken well,
c7318	again no more.
c7319	I will see thy face
c7320	And the LORD said unto Moses,
c7321	Yet will I bring one plague <i>more</i> upon Pharaoh, and upon Egypt;
c7322	afterwards he will let you go hence:
c7323	when he shall let <i>you</i> go, he shall surely thrust you out hence altogether.
c7325	Speak now in the ears of the people,
c7327	and let every man borrow of his neighbour,
c7328	and every woman of her neighbour,
c7329	jewels of silver, and jewels of gold.
c7330	And the LORD gave the people favour in the sight of the Egyptians. Moreover the man Moses <i>was</i> very great in the land of Egypt,
c7331	in the sight of Pharaoh's servants, and in the sight of the people.
c7332	And Moses said,
c7333	Thus saith the LORD,
c7334	About midnight will I go out into the midst of Egypt:
c7335	And all the firstborn in the land of Egypt shall die,
c7336	from the firstborn of Pharaoh
c7337	that sitteth upon his throne,
c7338	even unto the firstborn of the maidservant
c7339	that <i>is</i> behind the mill;
c7340	and all the firstborn of beasts.
c7341	And there shall be a great cry throughout all the land of Egypt,
c7342	such as there was none like it,
c7343	nor shall be like it any more.
c7344	But against any of the children of Israel shall not a dog move his tongue, against man or beast:
c7345	that ye may know
c7346	how that the LORD doth put a difference between the Egyptians and Israel.
c7347	And all these thy servants shall come down unto
c7348	me, and bow down themselves
c7349	unto me, saying,
c7350	Get thee out, and all the people
c7351	that follow
c7352	thee: and after that I will go out.
c7353	And he went out from Pharaoh in a great anger.
c7354	And the LORD said unto Moses,
c7355	Pharaoh shall not hearken unto
c7356	you; that my wonders may be multiplied in the land of Egypt.
c7357	And Moses and Aaron did all these wonders before Pharaoh:
c7358	and the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart,
c7359	so that he would not let the children of Israel go out of his land.
c7360	And the LORD spake unto Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt,
c7361	saying,
c7362	This month <i>shall be</i> unto you the beginning of months:
c7363	it <i>shall be</i> the first month of the year to you.
c7364	Speak ye unto all the congregation of Israel,
c7365	saying,
c7366	In the tenth <i>day</i> of this month
c7367	they shall take
c7368	to them every man a lamb, according to the house of <i>their</i> fathers,
c7369	a lamb for an house:
c7370	And if the household be too little
c7371	for the lamb,
c7372	let him and his neighbour next unto his house take
c7374	<i>it</i> according to the number of the souls;
c7375	every man according to his eating
c7376	shall make your count for the lamb.
c7377	Your lamb shall be without blemish, a male of the first year:
c7378	ye shall take <i>it</i> out from the sheep, or from the goats:
c7379	And ye shall keep it up until the fourteenth day of the same month:
c7380	and the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel shall kill it in the evening.
c7381	And they shall take of the blood,
c7382	and strike <i>it</i> on the two side posts and on the upper door post of the houses,
c7383	wherein they shall eat it.
c7384	And they shall eat the flesh in that night, roast with fire,
c7385	and unleavened bread; <i>and</i> with bitter <i>herbs</i> they shall eat it.
c7386	Eat not of it raw, nor sodden at all
c7387	with water,
c7388	but roast <i>with</i> fire; his head with his legs, and with the purtenance thereof.
c7389	And ye shall let nothing of it remain until the morning;
c7391	and that which remaineth of it until the morning
c7392	ye shall burn with fire.
c7393	And thus shall ye eat
c7394	it; <i>with</i> your loins girded,
c7395	your shoes on your feet,
c7396	and your staff in your hand;
c7397	and ye shall eat it in haste:
c7398	it <i>is</i> the LORD'S passover.
c7399	For I will pass through the land of Egypt this night,
c7400	and will smite all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both man and beast;
c7401	and against all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgment:
c7402	I <i>am</i> the LORD.
c7403	And the blood shall be to you for a token upon the houses
c7404	where ye
c7405	<i>are:</i> and when I see the blood,
c7406	I will pass over
c7407	you, and the plague shall not be upon you to destroy
c7408	<i>you,</i> when I smite the land of Egypt.
c7409	And this day shall be unto you for a memorial;
c7410	and ye shall keep it a feast to the LORD throughout your generations;
c7411	ye shall keep it a feast by an ordinance for ever.
c7412	Seven days shall ye eat unleavened bread;
c7413	even the first day ye shall put away leaven out of your houses:
c7414	for whosoever
c7415	eateth leavened bread
c7416	from the first day until the seventh day, that soul shall be cut off from Israel.
c7417	And in the first day <i>there shall be</i> an holy convocation,
c7418	and in the seventh day there shall be an holy convocation
c7419	to you; no manner of work shall be done
c7420	in them, save <i>that</i> which every man must eat,
c7421	that only may be done of you.
c7422	And ye shall observe <i>the feast of</i> unleavened bread;
c7423	for in this selfsame day have I brought your armies out of the land of Egypt:
c7424	therefore shall ye observe this day in your generations by an ordinance for ever.
c7425	In the first <i>month,</i> on the fourteenth day of the month at even, ye shall eat unleavened bread, until the one and twentieth day of the month at even.
c7426	Seven days shall there be no leaven found in your houses:
c7427	for whosoever
c7428	eateth that which is leavened,
c7429	even that soul shall be cut off from the congregation of Israel, whether he be a stranger, or born in the land.
c7430	Ye shall eat nothing leavened;
c7431	in all your habitations shall ye eat unleavened bread.
c7432	Then Moses called for all the elders of Israel,
c7433	and said unto
c7434	them, Draw out
c7435	and take you a lamb according to your families,
c7436	and kill the passover.
c7437	And ye shall take a bunch of hyssop,
c7438	and dip <i>it</i> in the blood
c7439	that <i>is</i> in the bason,
c7440	and strike the lintel and the two side posts with the blood
c7441	that <i>is</i> in the bason;
c7442	and none of you shall go out
c7443	at the door of his house
c7444	until the morning.
c7445	For the LORD will pass through
c7446	to smite the Egyptians;
c7447	and when he seeth the blood upon the lintel, and on the two side posts,
c7448	the LORD will pass over the door,
c7449	and will not suffer the destroyer
c7450	to come in unto your houses
c7451	to smite <i>you.</i>
c7452	And ye shall observe this thing for an ordinance to thee and to thy sons for ever.
c7453	And it shall come to pass,
c7454	when ye be come to the land
c7455	which the LORD will give
c7456	you, according as he hath promised,
c7457	that ye shall keep this service.
c7458	And it shall come to pass,
c7459	when your children shall say unto
c7460	you, What mean ye by this service?
c7461	That ye shall say,
c7462	It <i>is</i> the sacrifice of the LORD'S passover,
c7463	who passed over the houses of the children of Israel in Egypt,
c7464	when he smote the Egyptians,
c7465	and delivered our houses.
c7466	And the people bowed the head
c7467	and worshipped.
c7469	And the children of Israel went away, and did
c7470	as the LORD had commanded Moses and Aaron,
c7471	so did they.
c7472	And it came to pass, that at midnight
c7473	the LORD smote all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, from the firstborn of Pharaoh
c7474	that sat on his throne
c7475	unto the firstborn of the captive
c7476	that <i>was</i> in the dungeon;
c7477	and all the firstborn of cattle.
c7478	And Pharaoh rose up in the night, he, and all his servants, and all the Egyptians; and there was a great cry in Egypt;
c7480	for <i>there was</i> not a house
c7481	where <i>there was</i> not one dead.
c7482	And he called for Moses and Aaron by night,
c7483	and said,
c7484	Rise up,
c7485	<i>and</i> get you forth from among my people,
c7486	both ye and the children of Israel;
c7487	and go,
c7488	serve the LORD,
c7489	as ye have said.
c7490	Also take your flocks and your herds,
c7491	as ye have said,
c7492	and be gone;
c7493	and bless me also.
c7494	And the Egyptians were urgent upon the people,
c7495	in haste;
c7496	that they might send them out of the land
c7497	for they said,
c7498	We <i>be</i> all dead <i>men.</i>
c7499	And the people took their dough
c7500	before it was leavened,
c7501	their kneadingtroughs being bound up in their clothes upon their shoulders.
c7502	And the children of Israel did according to the word of Moses;
c7503	and they borrowed of the Egyptians jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment:
c7504	And the LORD gave the people favour in the sight of the Egyptians,
c7505	so that they lent
c7506	unto them <i>such things as they required.</i> And they spoiled the Egyptians.
c7507	And the children of Israel journeyed from Rameses to Succoth,
c7508	about six hundred thousand on foot
c7509	<i>that were</i> men, beside children.
c7510	And a mixed multitude went up also with them; and flocks, and herds, <i>even</i> very much cattle.
c7511	And they baked unleavened cakes of the dough
c7512	which they brought forth out of Egypt,
c7514	for it was not leavened;
c7515	because they were thrust out of Egypt,
c7516	and could not
c7517	tarry,
c7518	neither had they prepared for themselves any victual.
c7519	Now the sojourning of the children of Israel,
c7520	who dwelt in Egypt,
c7521	<i>was</i> four hundred and thirty years.
c7522	And it came to pass at the end of the four hundred and thirty years,
c7523	even the selfsame day it came to pass,
c7524	that all the hosts of the LORD went out from the land of Egypt.
c7525	It <i>is</i> a night to be much observed unto the LORD
c7526	for bringing them out from the land of Egypt:
c7527	this <i>is</i> that night of the LORD to be observed of all the children of Israel in their generations.
c7528	And the LORD said unto Moses and Aaron,
c7529	This <i>is</i> the ordinance of the passover:
c7530	There shall no stranger eat thereof:
c7531	But every man's servant that is bought for money,
c7532	when thou hast circumcised
c7533	him, then shall he eat thereof.
c7534	A foreigner and an hired servant shall not eat thereof.
c7535	In one house shall it be eaten;
c7536	thou shalt not carry forth ought of the flesh abroad out of the house;
c7537	neither shall ye break a bone thereof.
c7538	All the congregation of Israel shall keep it.
c7539	And when a stranger shall sojourn with
c7540	thee, and will keep the passover to the LORD,
c7541	let all his males be circumcised,
c7542	and then let him come near
c7543	and keep
c7544	it; and he shall be as one that is born in the land:
c7545	for no uncircumcised person shall eat thereof.
c7546	One law shall be to him that is homeborn, and unto the stranger
c7547	that sojourneth among you.
c7548	Thus did all the children of Israel;
c7549	as the LORD commanded Moses and Aaron,
c7550	so did they.
c7551	And it came to pass the selfsame day,
c7552	<i>that</i> the LORD did bring the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt by their armies.
c7553	And the LORD spake unto Moses,
c7554	saying,
c7555	Sanctify unto me all the firstborn,
c7556	whatsoever openeth the womb among the children of Israel, <i>both</i> of man and of beast:
c7557	it <i>is</i> mine.
c7558	And Moses said unto the people,
c7559	Remember this day,
c7560	in which ye came out from Egypt, out of the house of bondage;
c7561	for by strength of hand the LORD brought you out from this
c7562	<i>place:</i> there shall no leavened bread be eaten.
c7563	This day came ye out in the month Abib.
c7564	And it shall be
c7565	when the LORD shall bring thee into the land of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites,
c7566	which he sware unto thy fathers
c7567	to give
c7568	thee, a land flowing with milk and honey,
c7569	that thou shalt keep this service in this month.
c7570	Seven days thou shalt eat unleavened bread,
c7571	and in the seventh day <i>shall be</i> a feast to the LORD.
c7572	Unleavened bread shall be eaten seven days;
c7573	and there shall no leavened bread be seen
c7574	with thee, neither shall there be leaven seen with thee in all thy quarters.
c7575	And thou shalt shew thy son in that day,
c7576	saying,
c7577	<i>This is done</i> because of that <i>which</i> the LORD did
c7578	unto me when I came forth out of Egypt.
c7579	And it shall be for a sign unto thee upon thine hand, and for a memorial between thine eyes,
c7580	that the LORD'S law may be in thy mouth:
c7581	for with a strong hand hath the LORD brought thee out of Egypt.
c7582	Thou shalt therefore keep this ordinance in his season from year to year.
c7583	And it shall be
c7584	when the LORD shall bring thee into the land of the Canaanites,
c7585	as he sware unto thee and to thy fathers,
c7586	and shall give it thee,
c7587	That thou shalt set apart unto the LORD all that openeth the matrix,
c7588	and every firstling that cometh of a beast
c7589	which thou hast;
c7590	the males <i>shall be</i> the LORD'S.
c7591	And every firstling of an ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb;
c7592	and if thou wilt not redeem
c7593	it, then thou shalt break his neck:
c7594	and all the firstborn of man among thy children shalt thou redeem.
c7595	And it shall be
c7596	when thy son asketh thee in time to come,
c7597	saying,
c7598	What <i>is</i> this?
c7599	that thou shalt say unto
c7600	him, By strength of hand the LORD brought us out from Egypt, from the house of bondage:
c7601	And it came to pass,
c7602	when Pharaoh would hardly
c7603	let us go,
c7604	that the LORD slew all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both the firstborn of man, and the firstborn of beast:
c7605	therefore I sacrifice to the LORD all that openeth the matrix, being males;
c7606	but all the firstborn of my children I redeem.
c7607	And it shall be for a token upon thine hand, and for frontlets between thine eyes:
c7608	for by strength of hand the LORD brought us forth out of Egypt.
c7609	And it came to pass,
c7610	when Pharaoh had let the people go,
c7611	that God led them not <i>through</i> the way of the land of the Philistines,
c7612	although that <i>was</i> near;
c7613	for God said,
c7614	Lest peradventure the people repent
c7615	when they see war,
c7616	and they return to Egypt:
c7617	But God led the people about, <i>through</i> the way of the wilderness of the Red sea:
c7618	and the children of Israel went up harnessed out of the land of Egypt.
c7619	And Moses took the bones of Joseph with
c7620	him: for he had straitly sworn the children of Israel,
c7621	saying,
c7622	God will surely visit
c7623	you; and ye shall carry up my bones away hence with you.
c7624	And they took their journey from Succoth,
c7625	and encamped in Etham, in the edge of the wilderness.
c7626	And the LORD went before
c7627	them by day in a pillar of a cloud,
c7628	to lead them the way;
c7629	and by night in a pillar of fire,
c7630	to give them light;
c7631	to go by day and night:
c7632	He took not away the pillar of the cloud by day,
c7633	nor the pillar of fire by night, <i>from</i> before the people.
c7634	And the LORD spake unto Moses,
c7635	saying,
c7636	Speak unto the children of Israel,
c7637	that they turn
c7638	and encamp before Pihahiroth, between Migdol and the sea, over against Baalzephon:
c7639	before it shall ye encamp by the sea.
c7640	For Pharaoh will say of the children of Israel,
c7641	They <i>are</i> entangled in the land,
c7642	the wilderness hath shut them in.
c7643	And I will harden Pharaoh's heart,
c7644	that he shall follow after
c7645	them; and I will be honoured upon Pharaoh, and upon all his host;
c7646	that the Egyptians may know
c7647	that I <i>am</i> the LORD.
c7648	And they did so.
c7649	And it was told the king of Egypt
c7650	that the people fled:
c7651	and the heart of Pharaoh and of his servants was turned against the people,
c7652	and they said,
c7653	Why have we done this,
c7654	that we have let Israel go
c7655	from serving us?
c7656	And he made ready his chariot,
c7657	and took his people with him:
c7658	And he took six hundred chosen chariots, and all the chariots of Egypt,
c7659	and captains over every one of them.
c7660	And the LORD hardened the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt,
c7661	and he pursued after the children of Israel:
c7662	and the children of Israel went out with an high hand.
c7663	But the Egyptians pursued after
c7665	them encamping by the sea, beside Pihahiroth, before Baalzephon.
c7666	them, all the horses <i>and</i> chariots of Pharaoh, and his horsemen, and his army, and overtook
c7667	And when Pharaoh drew nigh,
c7668	the children of Israel lifted up their eyes,
c7669	and, behold,
c7670	the Egyptians marched after
c7671	them; and they were sore afraid:
c7672	and the children of Israel cried out unto the LORD.
c7673	And they said unto Moses,
c7674	Because <i>there were</i> no graves in Egypt,
c7675	hast thou taken us away
c7676	to die in the wilderness?
c7677	wherefore hast thou dealt thus
c7678	with us, to carry us forth out of Egypt?
c7679	<i>Is</i> not this the word
c7680	that we did tell thee in Egypt,
c7681	saying,
c7682	Let us alone,
c7683	that we may serve the Egyptians?
c7684	For <i>it had been</i> better
c7685	for us to serve the Egyptians,
c7686	than that we should die in the wilderness.
c7687	And Moses said unto the people,
c7688	Fear ye not,
c7689	stand still,
c7690	and see the salvation of the LORD,
c7691	which he will shew to you to day:
c7692	for
c7693	the Egyptians whom ye have seen to day,
c7694	no more
c7695	ye shall see them again
c7696	for ever.
c7697	The LORD shall fight
c7698	for you, and ye shall hold your peace.
c7699	And the LORD said unto Moses,
c7700	Wherefore criest thou unto
c7701	me? speak unto the children of Israel,
c7702	that they go forward:
c7703	But lift thou up thy rod,
c7704	and stretch out thine hand over the sea,
c7705	and divide
c7706	it: and the children of Israel shall go on dry <i>ground</i> through the midst of the sea.
c7707	And I,
c7708	behold, I will harden the hearts of the Egyptians,
c7709	and they shall follow
c7710	them: and I will get me honour upon Pharaoh, and upon all his host, upon his chariots, and upon his horsemen.
c7711	And the Egyptians shall know
c7712	that I <i>am</i> the LORD,
c7713	when I have gotten me honour upon Pharaoh, upon his chariots, and upon his horsemen.
c7714	And the angel of God, which went before the camp of Israel, removed
c7716	and went behind
c7717	them; and the pillar of the cloud went from before their face,
c7718	and stood behind them:
c7719	And it came between the camp of the Egyptians and the camp of Israel;
c7720	and it was a cloud and darkness
c7721	<i>to them,</i> but it gave light by night
c7722	<i>to these:</i> so that the one came not near the other all the night.
c7723	And Moses stretched out his hand over the sea;
c7724	and the LORD caused the sea to go <i>back</i> by a strong east wind all that night,
c7725	and made the sea dry
c7726	<i>land,</i> and the waters were divided.
c7727	And the children of Israel went into the midst of the sea upon the dry
c7728	<i>ground:</i> and the waters <i>were</i> a wall unto them on their right hand, and on their left.
c7729	And the Egyptians pursued,
c7730	and went in after them to the midst of the sea, <i>even</i> all Pharaoh's horses, his chariots, and his horsemen.
c7731	And it came to pass, that in the morning watch
c7732	the LORD looked unto the host of the Egyptians through the pillar of fire and of the cloud,
c7733	and troubled the host of the Egyptians,
c7734	And took off their chariot wheels,
c7735	that they drave them heavily:
c7736	so that the Egyptians said,
c7737	Let us flee from the face of Israel;
c7738	for the LORD fighteth for them against the Egyptians.
c7739	And the LORD said unto Moses,
c7740	Stretch out thine hand over the sea,
c7741	that the waters may come again upon the Egyptians, upon their chariots, and upon their horsemen.
c7742	And Moses stretched forth his hand over the sea,
c7743	and the sea returned
c7744	to his strength when the morning appeared;
c7745	and the Egyptians fled
c7746	against
c7747	it; and the LORD overthrew the Egyptians in the midst of the sea.
c7748	And the waters returned,
c7749	and covered the chariots, and the horsemen, <i>and</i> all the host of Pharaoh
c7750	that came into the sea after
c7751	them; there remained not so much as one of them.
c7752	But the children of Israel walked upon dry <i>land</i> in the midst of the sea;
c7753	and the waters <i>were</i> a wall unto them on their right hand, and on their left.
c7754	Thus the LORD saved Israel that day out of the hand of the Egyptians;
c7755	and Israel saw the Egyptians
c7756	dead upon the sea shore.
c7757	And Israel saw that great work
c7758	which the LORD did upon the Egyptians:
c7759	and the people feared the LORD,
c7760	and believed the LORD, and his servant Moses.
c7761	Then sang Moses and the children of Israel this song unto the LORD,
c7762	and spake,
c7763	saying,
c7764	I will sing unto the LORD,
c7765	for he hath triumphed gloriously:
c7766	the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea.
c7767	The LORD <i>is</i> my strength and song,
c7768	and he is become my salvation:
c7769	he <i>is</i> my God,
c7770	and I will prepare him an habitation;
c7771	my father's God,
c7772	and I will exalt him.
c7773	The LORD <i>is</i> a man of war:
c7774	the LORD <i>is</i> his name.
c7775	Pharaoh's chariots and his host hath he cast into the sea:
c7776	his chosen captains also are drowned in the Red sea.
c7777	The depths have covered
c7778	them: they sank into the bottom as a stone.
c7779	Thy right hand,
c7780	O LORD,
c7781	is become glorious in power:
c7782	thy right hand,
c7783	O LORD,
c7784	hath dashed in pieces the enemy.
c7785	And in the greatness of thine excellency thou hast overthrown them that rose up against
c7786	thee: thou sentest forth thy wrath,
c7787	<i>which</i> consumed them as stubble.
c7788	And with the blast of thy nostrils the waters were gathered together,
c7789	the floods stood upright as an heap,
c7790	<i>and</i> the depths were congealed in the heart of the sea.
c7791	The enemy said,
c7792	I will pursue,
c7793	I will overtake,
c7794	I will divide the spoil;
c7795	my lust shall be satisfied
c7796	upon them; I will draw my sword,
c7797	my hand shall destroy them.
c7798	Thou didst blow with thy wind,
c7799	the sea covered
c7800	them: they sank as lead in the mighty waters.
c7801	Who <i>is</i> like unto thee, O LORD, among the gods?
c7803	who <i>is</i> like thee,
c7804	glorious in holiness,
c7805	fearful <i>in</i> praises,
c7806	doing wonders?
c7807	Thou stretchedst out thy right hand,
c7808	the earth swallowed them.
c7809	Thou in thy mercy hast led forth the people
c7810	which thou hast redeemed:
c7811	thou hast guided <i>them</i> in thy strength unto thy holy habitation.
c7812	The people shall hear,
c7813	<i>and</i> be afraid:
c7814	sorrow shall take hold on the inhabitants of Palestina.
c7815	Then the dukes of Edom shall be amazed;
c7816	the mighty men of Moab,
c7817	trembling shall take hold upon
c7818	them; all the inhabitants of Canaan shall melt away.
c7819	Fear and dread shall fall upon
c7820	them; by the greatness of thine arm they shall be <i>as</i> still as a stone;
c7821	till thy people pass over,
c7822	O LORD,
c7823	till the people pass over,
c7824	which thou hast purchased.
c7825	Thou shalt bring them in,
c7826	and plant them in the mountain of thine inheritance,
c7827	<i>in</i> the place,
c7828	<i>which</i> thou hast made for thee to dwell in,
c7829	O LORD,
c7830	<i>in</i> the Sanctuary,
c7831	O Lord,
c7832	<i>which</i> thy hands have established.
c7833	The LORD shall reign for ever and ever.
c7834	For the horse of Pharaoh went in with his chariots and with his horsemen into the sea,
c7835	and the LORD brought again the waters of the sea upon
c7836	them; but the children of Israel went on dry <i>land</i> in the midst of the sea.
c7837	And Miriam the prophetess, the sister of Aaron, took a timbrel in her hand;
c7838	and all the women went out after her with timbrels and with dances.
c7839	And Miriam answered
c7840	them, Sing ye to the LORD,
c7841	for he hath triumphed gloriously;
c7842	the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea.
c7843	So Moses brought Israel from the Red sea,
c7844	and they went out into the wilderness of Shur;
c7845	and they went three days in the wilderness,
c7846	and found no water.
c7847	And when they came to Marah,
c7848	they could not
c7849	drink of the waters of Marah,
c7850	for they <i>were</i> bitter:
c7851	therefore the name of it was called Marah.
c7852	And the people murmured against Moses,
c7853	saying,
c7854	What shall we drink?
c7855	And he cried unto the LORD;
c7856	and the LORD shewed him a tree,
c7857	<i>which</i> when he had cast into the waters,
c7858	the waters were made sweet:
c7859	there he made for them a statute and an ordinance,
c7860	and there he proved them,
c7861	And said,
c7862	If thou wilt diligently hearken to the voice of the LORD thy God,
c7864	that which is right in his sight,
c7865	and wilt do
c7866	and wilt give ear to his commandments,
c7867	and keep all his statutes,
c7869	I will put none of these diseases
c7870	upon thee, which I have brought upon the Egyptians:
c7871	for I <i>am</i> the LORD that healeth thee.
c7872	And they came to Elim,
c7873	where <i>were</i> twelve wells of water, and threescore and ten palm trees:
c7874	and they encamped there by the waters.
c7875	And they took their journey from Elim,
c7876	and all the congregation of the children of Israel came unto the wilderness of Sin,
c7877	which <i>is</i> between Elim and Sinai,
c7878	on the fifteenth day of the second month
c7879	after their departing out of the land of Egypt.
c7880	And the whole congregation of the children of Israel murmured against Moses and Aaron in the wilderness:
c7881	And the children of Israel said unto
c7882	them, Would to God
c7883	we had died by the hand of the LORD in the land of Egypt,
c7884	when we sat by the flesh pots,
c7885	<i>and</i> when we did eat bread to the full;
c7886	for ye have brought us forth into this wilderness,
c7887	to kill this whole assembly with hunger.
c7888	Then said the LORD unto Moses,
c7889	Behold, I will rain bread from heaven
c7890	for you; and the people shall go out
c7891	and gather a certain rate every day,
c7892	that I may prove
c7893	them, whether they will walk in my law,
c7894	or no.
c7895	And it shall come to pass, that on the sixth day
c7896	they shall prepare
c7897	<i>that</i> which they bring in;
c7898	and it shall be twice
c7899	as much as they gather daily.
c7900	And Moses and Aaron said unto all the children of Israel,
c7901	At even,
c7902	then ye shall know
c7903	that the LORD hath brought you out from the land of Egypt:
c7904	And in the morning,
c7905	then ye shall see the glory of the LORD;
c7906	for that he heareth your murmurings against the LORD:
c7907	<i>are</i> we,
c7908	and what
c7909	that ye murmur against us?
c7910	And Moses said,
c7911	<i>This shall be,</i> when the LORD shall give you in the evening flesh
c7912	to eat,
c7913	and in the morning bread
c7914	to the full;
c7915	for that the LORD heareth your murmurings
c7916	which ye murmur against him: and what
c7917	<i>are</i> we? your murmurings
c7919	<i>are</i> not against
c7920	us, but against the LORD.
c7921	And Moses spake unto Aaron,
c7922	Say unto all the congregation of the children of Israel,
c7923	Come near before the LORD:
c7924	for he hath heard your murmurings.
c7925	And it came to pass,
c7926	as Aaron spake unto the whole congregation of the children of Israel,
c7927	that they looked toward the wilderness,
c7928	and, behold,
c7929	the glory of the LORD appeared in the cloud.
c7930	And the LORD spake unto Moses,
c7931	saying,
c7932	I have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel:
c7933	speak unto
c7934	them, saying,
c7935	At even ye shall eat flesh,
c7936	and in the morning ye shall be filled with bread;
c7937	and ye shall know
c7938	that I <i>am</i> the LORD your God.
c7939	And it came to pass, that at even
c7940	the quails came up,
c7941	and covered the camp:
c7942	and in the morning the dew lay round about the host.
c7943	And when the dew that lay was gone up,
c7944	behold,
c7945	upon the face of the wilderness <i>there lay</i> a small round thing,
c7946	<i>as</i> small as the hoar frost on the ground.
c7947	And when the children of Israel saw
c7948	<i>it,</i> they said
c7949	one to another,
c7950	It <i>is</i> manna:
c7951	for they wist not
c7952	what it
c7953	<i>was.</i> And Moses said unto
c7954	them, This <i>is</i> the bread
c7955	which the LORD hath given you to eat.
c7956	This <i>is</i> the thing
c7957	which the LORD hath commanded,
c7958	Gather of
c7959	it every man according to his eating,
c7960	an omer for every man, <i>according to</i> the number of your persons;
c7961	ye every man
c7962	for <i>them</i> which <i>are</i> in his tents.
c7963	take
c7964	And the children of Israel did so,
c7965	and gathered,
c7966	some more,
c7967	some less.
c7968	And when they did mete <i>it</i> with an omer,
c7969	had nothing over,
c7970	he that gathered much
c7972	and he that gathered little
c7973	had no lack;
c7974	every man according to his eating.
c7975	they gathered
c7976	And Moses said,
c7978	Let no man leave of it till the morning.
c7979	Notwithstanding they hearkened not unto Moses;
c7980	but some of them left of it until the morning,
c7981	and it bred worms,
c7982	and stank:
c7983	and Moses was wroth with them.
c7984	And they gathered it every morning,
c7985	every man according to his eating:
c7986	and when the sun waxed hot,
c7987	it melted.
c7988	And it came to pass,
c7989	<i>that</i> on the sixth day they gathered twice as much bread, two omers for one
c7990	<i>man:</i> and all the rulers of the congregation came
c7991	and told Moses.
c7992	And he said unto
c7993	them, This
c7994	<i>is that</i> which the LORD hath said,
c7995	To morrow <i>is</i> the rest of the holy sabbath unto the LORD:
c7996	bake <i>that</i> which
c7997	ye will bake
c7999	<i>to day,</i> and seethe that
c8000	ye will seethe;
c8001	and that which remaineth over lay up for you to be kept until the morning.
c8002	And they laid it up till the morning,
c8003	as Moses bade:
c8004	and it did not stink,
c8005	neither was there any worm therein.
c8006	And Moses said,
c8007	Eat that to day;
c8008	for to day <i>is</i> a sabbath unto the LORD:
c8009	to day ye shall not find it in the field.
c8010	Six days ye shall gather
c8011	it; but on the seventh day, <i>which is</i> the sabbath,
c8012	in it there shall be none.
c8013	And it came to pass,
c8014	<i>that</i> there went out <i>some</i> of the people on the seventh day
c8015	for to gather,
c8016	and they found none.
c8017	And the LORD said unto Moses,
c8018	How long refuse
c8019	ye to keep my commandments and my laws?
c8020	See,
c8021	for that the LORD hath given you the sabbath,
c8022	therefore he giveth you on the sixth day the bread of two days;
c8023	abide
c8024	ye every man in his place,
c8025	let no man go out of his place on the seventh day.
c8026	So the people rested on the seventh day.
c8027	And the house of Israel called the name thereof Manna:
c8028	and it <i>was</i> like coriander seed, white;
c8029	and the taste of it <i>was</i> like wafers <i>made</i> with honey.
c8030	And Moses said,
c8031	This <i>is</i> the thing
c8032	which the LORD commandeth,
c8033	Fill an omer of it to be kept for your generations;
c8034	that they may see the bread
c8035	wherewith I have fed you in the wilderness,
c8036	when I brought you forth from the land of Egypt.
c8037	And Moses said unto Aaron,
c8038	Take a pot,
c8039	and put an omer full of manna therein,
c8040	and lay it up before the LORD, to be kept for your generations.
c8041	As the LORD commanded Moses,
c8042	so Aaron laid it up before the Testimony, to be kept.
c8043	And the children of Israel did eat manna forty years,
c8044	until they came to a land inhabited;
c8045	they did eat manna,
c8046	until they came unto the borders of the land of Canaan.
c8047	Now an omer
c8048	<i>is</i> the tenth <i>part</i> of an ephah.
c8049	And all the congregation of the children of Israel journeyed from the wilderness of Sin, after their journeys, according to the commandment of the LORD,
c8050	and pitched in Rephidim:
c8051	and <i>there was</i> no water
c8052	for the people to drink.
c8053	Wherefore the people did chide with Moses,
c8054	and said,
c8055	Give us water
c8056	that we may drink.
c8057	And Moses said
c8058	unto them, Why chide ye with
c8059	me? wherefore do ye tempt the LORD?
c8060	And the people thirsted there for water;
c8061	and the people murmured against Moses,
c8062	and said,
c8063	Wherefore <i>is</i> this <i>that</i> thou hast brought us up out of Egypt,
c8064	to kill us and our children and our cattle with thirst?
c8065	And Moses cried unto the LORD,
c8066	saying,
c8067	What shall I do unto this people?
c8068	they be almost ready
c8069	to stone me.
c8070	And the LORD said unto Moses,
c8071	Go on before the people,
c8072	and take with thee of the elders of Israel;
c8073	and thy rod,
c8074	wherewith thou smotest the river,
c8075	take in thine hand,
c8076	and go.
c8077	Behold, I will stand before thee there upon the rock in Horeb;
c8078	and thou shalt smite the rock,
c8079	and there shall come water out of
c8080	it, that the people may drink.
c8081	And Moses did so in the sight of the elders of Israel.
c8082	And he called the name of the place Massah, and Meribah,
c8083	because of the chiding of the children of Israel,
c8084	and because they tempted the LORD,
c8085	saying,
c8086	Is the LORD among
c8087	us, or not?
c8088	Then came Amalek,
c8089	and fought with Israel in Rephidim.
c8090	And Moses said unto Joshua,
c8091	Choose us out men,
c8092	and go out,
c8093	fight with Amalek:
c8094	to morrow I will stand on the top of the hill
c8095	with the rod of God in mine hand.
c8096	So Joshua did
c8097	as Moses had said
c8098	to him, and fought with Amalek:
c8099	and Moses, Aaron, and Hur went up to the top of the hill.
c8100	And it came to pass,
c8101	when Moses held up his hand,
c8102	that Israel prevailed:
c8104	and when he let down his hand,
c8105	Amalek prevailed.
c8106	But Moses' hands <i>were</i> heavy;
c8107	and they took a stone,
c8108	and put <i>it</i> under
c8109	him, and he sat thereon;
c8110	and Aaron and Hur stayed up his hands,
c8111	the one on the one side,
c8112	and the other on the other side;
c8113	and his hands were steady
c8114	until the going down of the sun.
c8115	And Joshua discomfited Amalek and his people with the edge of the sword.
c8116	And the LORD said unto Moses,
c8117	Write this <i>for</i> a memorial in a book,
c8118	and rehearse <i>it</i> in the ears of Joshua:
c8119	for I will utterly put out the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven.
c8120	And Moses built an altar,
c8121	and called the name
c8122	of it Jehovahnissi:
c8123	For he said,
c8124	Because the LORD hath sworn
c8125	<i>that</i> the LORD <i>will have</i> war with Amalek from generation to generation.
c8126	When Jethro, the priest of Midian, Moses' father in law, heard of all
c8127	that God had done for Moses, and for Israel his people,
c8128	<i>and</i> that the LORD had brought Israel out of Egypt;
c8129	Then Jethro, Moses' father in law, took Zipporah, Moses' wife, after he had sent her back,
c8130	And her two sons;
c8131	of which the name of the one <i>was</i> Gershom;
c8132	for he said,
c8133	I have been an alien in a strange land:
c8134	And the name of the other <i>was</i> Eliezer;
c8135	for
c8136	the God of my father, <i>said he, was</i> mine help,
c8137	and delivered me from the sword of Pharaoh:
c8138	And Jethro, Moses' father in law, came with his sons and his wife unto Moses into the wilderness,
c8139	where he encamped at the mount of God:
c8140	And he said unto Moses,
c8141	I thy father in law Jethro am come unto
c8142	thee, and thy wife,
c8143	and her two sons with her.
c8144	And Moses went out
c8145	to meet his father in law,
c8146	and did obeisance,
c8147	and kissed
c8148	him; and they asked
c8149	each other
c8150	of <i>their</i> welfare;
c8151	and they came into the tent.
c8152	And Moses told his father in law all
c8153	that the LORD had done unto Pharaoh and to the Egyptians for Israel's sake,
c8154	<i>and</i> all the travail
c8155	that had come upon them by the way,
c8156	and <i>how</i> the LORD delivered them.
c8157	And Jethro rejoiced for all the goodness
c8158	which the LORD had done to Israel,
c8159	whom he had delivered out of the hand of the Egyptians.
c8160	And Jethro said,
c8161	Blessed <i>be</i> the LORD,
c8162	who hath delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of Pharaoh,
c8163	who hath delivered the people from under the hand of the Egyptians.
c8164	Now I know
c8165	that the LORD <i>is</i> greater than all gods:
c8166	for in the thing
c8167	wherein they dealt proudly <i>he was</i> above them.
c8168	And Jethro, Moses' father in law, took a burnt offering and sacrifices for God:
c8169	and Aaron came, and all the elders of Israel,
c8170	to eat bread with Moses' father in law before God.
c8171	And it came to pass on the morrow,
c8172	that Moses sat
c8173	to judge the people:
c8174	and the people stood by Moses from the morning unto the evening.
c8175	And when Moses' father in law saw all
c8176	that he did to the people,
c8177	he said,
c8178	What <i>is</i> this thing
c8179	that thou doest to the people?
c8180	why sittest thou thyself alone,
c8181	and all the people stand by thee from morning unto even?
c8182	And Moses said unto his father in law,
c8183	Because the people come unto
c8184	me to enquire of God:
c8185	When they have a matter,
c8186	they come unto
c8187	me; and I judge between one and another,
c8188	and I do make <i>them</i> know the statutes of God, and his laws.
c8189	And Moses' father in law said unto
c8190	him, The thing that thou doest <i>is</i> not good.
c8192	Thou wilt surely wear away, both thou, and this people
c8193	that <i>is</i> with
c8194	thee: for this thing <i>is</i> too heavy for
c8195	thee; thou art not able
c8196	to perform it thyself alone.
c8198	Hearken now unto my voice,
c8199	I will give thee counsel,
c8200	and God shall be with
c8201	thee: Be thou for the people to God-ward,
c8202	that thou mayest bring the causes unto God:
c8203	And thou shalt teach them ordinances and laws,
c8204	and shalt shew them the way
c8205	wherein they must walk,
c8206	and the work
c8207	that they must do.
c8208	Moreover thou shalt provide out of all the people able men, such as fear God, men of truth, hating covetousness;
c8209	and place <i>such</i> over them, <i>to be</i> rulers of thousands, <i>and</i> rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens:
c8210	And let them judge the people at all seasons:
c8211	and it shall be,
c8212	<i>that</i> every great matter they shall bring unto
c8213	thee, but every small matter they shall judge:
c8214	so shall it be easier for
c8215	thyself, and they shall bear <i>the burden</i> with thee.
c8216	If thou shalt do this thing,
c8217	and God command
c8218	thee <i>so,</i> then thou shalt be able
c8219	to endure,
c8220	and all this people shall also go to their place in peace.
c8221	So Moses hearkened to the voice of his father in law,
c8222	and did all
c8223	that he had said.
c8224	And Moses chose able men out of all Israel,
c8225	and made them heads over the people, rulers of thousands, rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens.
c8226	And they judged the people at all seasons:
c8227	the hard causes they brought unto Moses,
c8228	but every small matter they judged themselves.
c8229	And Moses let his father in law depart;
c8230	and he went his way into his own land.
c8231	In the third month,
c8232	when the children of Israel were gone forth out of the land of Egypt,
c8233	the same day came they <i>into</i> the wilderness of Sinai.
c8234	For they were departed from Rephidim,
c8235	and were come <i>to</i> the desert of Sinai,
c8236	and had pitched in the wilderness;
c8237	and there Israel camped before the mount.
c8238	And Moses went up unto God,
c8239	and the LORD called unto him out of the mountain,
c8240	saying,
c8241	Thus shalt thou say to the house of Jacob,
c8242	and tell the children of Israel;
c8243	Ye have seen
c8244	what I did unto the Egyptians,
c8245	and <i>how</i> I bare you on eagles' wings,
c8246	and brought you unto myself.
c8247	Now
c8248	therefore, if ye will obey my voice indeed,
c8249	and keep my covenant,
c8250	then ye shall be a peculiar treasure unto me above all people:
c8251	for all the earth <i>is</i> mine:
c8252	And ye shall be unto me a kingdom of priests, and an holy nation.
c8253	These <i>are</i> the words
c8254	which thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel.
c8255	And Moses came
c8256	and called for the elders of the people,
c8257	and laid before their faces all these words
c8258	which the LORD commanded him.
c8259	And all the people answered together,
c8260	and said,
c8261	All
c8262	that the LORD hath spoken
c8263	we will do.
c8264	And Moses returned the words of the people unto the LORD.
c8265	And the LORD said unto Moses,
c8266	Lo, I come unto thee in a thick cloud,
c8267	that the people may hear
c8268	when I speak with
c8269	thee, and believe thee for ever.
c8270	And Moses told the words of the people unto the LORD.
c8271	And the LORD said unto Moses,
c8272	Go unto the people,
c8273	and sanctify them to day and to morrow,
c8274	and let them wash their clothes,
c8275	And be ready against the third day:
c8276	for the third day the LORD will come down in the sight of all the people upon mount Sinai.
c8277	And thou shalt set bounds unto the people round about,
c8278	saying,
c8279	Take heed
c8280	to yourselves, <i>that ye</i> go <i>not</i> up into the mount,
c8281	or touch the border
c8282	of it: whosoever
c8283	toucheth the mount
c8284	shall be surely put to death:
c8285	There shall not an hand touch
c8286	it, but he shall surely be stoned,
c8287	or shot through;
c8288	whether <i>it be</i> beast
c8289	or man,
c8290	it shall not live:
c8291	when the trumpet soundeth long,
c8292	they shall come up to the mount.
c8293	And Moses went down from the mount unto the people,
c8294	and sanctified the people;
c8295	and they washed their clothes.
c8296	And he said unto the people,
c8297	Be ready against the third day:
c8298	come not at <i>your</i> wives.
c8299	And it came to pass on the third day
c8300	in the morning, that there were
c8302	thunders and lightnings, and a thick cloud upon the mount,
c8303	and the voice of the trumpet exceeding loud;
c8304	so that all the people that <i>was</i> in the camp trembled.
c8306	And Moses brought forth the people
c8307	to meet with God;
c8308	out of the camp
c8309	and they stood at the nether part of the mount.
c8310	And mount Sinai was altogether on a smoke,
c8311	because the LORD descended upon it in fire:
c8312	and the smoke thereof ascended as the smoke of a furnace,
c8313	and the whole mount quaked greatly.
c8314	And when
c8315	the voice of the trumpet sounded long,
c8316	and waxed louder and louder,
c8317	Moses spake,
c8318	and God answered him by a voice.
c8319	And the LORD came down upon mount Sinai, on the top of the mount:
c8320	and the LORD called Moses <i>up</i> to the top of the mount;
c8321	and Moses went up.
c8322	And the LORD said unto Moses,
c8323	Go down,
c8324	charge the people,
c8325	lest they break through unto the LORD
c8326	to gaze,
c8327	and many of them perish.
c8328	And let the priests also,
c8329	which come near to the LORD,
c8330	sanctify themselves,
c8331	lest the LORD break forth upon them.
c8332	And Moses said unto the LORD,
c8333	The people cannot
c8334	come up to mount Sinai:
c8335	for thou chargedst
c8336	us, saying,
c8337	Set bounds about the mount,
c8338	and sanctify it.
c8339	And the LORD said unto
c8340	him, Away,
c8341	get thee down,
c8342	and thou shalt come up, thou, and Aaron with
c8343	thee: but let not the priests and the people break through
c8344	to come up unto the LORD,
c8345	lest he break forth upon them.
c8346	So Moses went down unto the people,
c8347	and spake unto them.
c8348	And God spake all these words,
c8349	saying,
c8350	I <i>am</i> the LORD thy God,
c8351	which have brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.
c8352	Thou shalt have no other gods before me.
c8353	Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness
c8354	<i>of any thing</i> that <i>is</i> in heaven above,
c8355	or that <i>is</i> in the earth beneath,
c8356	or that <i>is</i> in the water under the earth:
c8357	Thou shalt not bow down thyself
c8358	to them, nor serve
c8359	them: for I the LORD thy God <i>am</i> a jealous God,
c8360	visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children
c8361	unto the third and fourth <i>generation</i> of them that hate me;
c8362	And shewing mercy unto thousands of them that love me, and keep my commandments.
c8363	Thou shalt not take the name of the LORD thy God in vain;
c8364	for the LORD will not hold him guiltless
c8365	that taketh his name in vain.
c8366	Remember the sabbath day,
c8367	to keep it holy.
c8368	Six days shalt thou labour,
c8369	and do all thy work:
c8370	But the seventh day <i>is</i> the sabbath of the LORD thy God:
c8371	<i>in it</i> thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger
c8372	that <i>is</i> within thy gates:
c8373	For <i>in</i> six days the LORD made heaven and earth, the sea, and all
c8374	that
c8375	in them <i>is,</i> and rested the seventh day:
c8376	wherefore the LORD blessed the sabbath day,
c8377	and hallowed it.
c8378	Honour thy father and thy mother:
c8379	that thy days may be long upon the land
c8380	which the LORD thy God giveth thee.
c8381	Thou shalt not kill.
c8382	Thou shalt not commit adultery.
c8383	Thou shalt not steal.
c8384	Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour.
c8385	Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's house,
c8386	thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's wife, nor his manservant, nor his maidservant, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor any thing
c8387	that <i>is</i> thy neighbour's.
c8388	And all the people saw the thunderings, and the lightnings, and the noise of the trumpet, and the mountain
c8389	smoking:
c8390	and when the people saw
c8391	<i>it,</i> they removed,
c8392	and stood afar off.
c8393	And they said unto Moses,
c8394	Speak thou with
c8395	us, and we will hear:
c8396	but let not God speak with
c8397	us, lest we die.
c8398	And Moses said unto the people,
c8399	Fear not:
c8400	for
c8401	to prove
c8402	God is come
c8403	you, and that his fear may be before your faces,
c8404	that ye sin not.
c8405	And the people stood afar off,
c8406	and Moses drew near unto the thick darkness
c8407	where God <i>was.</i>
c8408	And the LORD said unto Moses,
c8409	Thus thou shalt say unto the children of Israel,
c8410	Ye have seen
c8411	that I have talked with you from heaven.
c8412	Ye shall not make with me gods of silver,
c8413	neither shall ye make unto you gods of gold.
c8414	An altar of earth thou shalt make
c8415	unto me, and shalt sacrifice thereon thy burnt offerings, and thy peace offerings, thy sheep, and thine oxen:
c8416	in all places
c8417	where I record my name
c8418	I will come unto
c8419	thee, and I will bless thee.
c8420	And if thou wilt make me an altar of stone,
c8421	thou shalt not build it of hewn stone:
c8422	for if thou lift up thy tool upon
c8423	it, thou hast polluted it.
c8424	Neither shalt thou go up by steps unto mine altar,
c8425	that thy nakedness be not discovered thereon.
c8426	Now these <i>are</i> the judgments
c8427	which thou shalt set before them.
c8428	If thou buy an Hebrew servant,
c8429	six years he shall serve:
c8430	and in the seventh he shall go out free for nothing.
c8431	If he came in by himself,
c8432	he shall go out by himself:
c8433	if he were married,
c8434	then his wife shall go out with him.
c8435	If his master have given him a wife,
c8436	and she have born him sons or daughters;
c8437	the wife and her children shall be her master's,
c8438	and he shall go out by himself.
c8439	And if the servant shall plainly say,
c8440	I love my master, my wife, and my children;
c8441	I will not go out free:
c8442	Then his master shall bring him unto the judges;
c8443	he shall also bring him to the door, or unto the door post;
c8444	and his master shall bore his ear through with an aul;
c8445	and he shall serve him for ever.
c8446	And if a man sell his daughter to be a maidservant,
c8447	she shall not go out
c8448	as the menservants do.
c8449	If she please not her master,
c8450	who hath betrothed
c8451	her to himself, then shall he let her be redeemed:
c8452	her unto a strange nation he shall have no power,
c8453	to sell
c8454	seeing he hath dealt deceitfully with her.
c8455	And if he have betrothed her unto his son,
c8456	he shall deal with her after the manner of daughters.
c8457	If he take him another
c8458	<i>wife;</i> her food, her raiment, and her duty of marriage, shall he not diminish.
c8459	And if he do not these three
c8460	unto her, then shall she go out free
c8461	without money.
c8462	He that smiteth a man,
c8463	so that he die,
c8464	shall be surely put to death.
c8465	And if a man lie not in wait,
c8466	but God deliver <i>him</i> into his hand;
c8467	then I will appoint thee a place
c8468	whither he shall flee.
c8469	But if a man come presumptuously upon his neighbour,
c8470	to slay him with guile;
c8471	thou shalt take him from mine altar,
c8472	that he may die.
c8473	And he that smiteth his father, or his mother,
c8474	shall be surely put to death.
c8475	And he that stealeth a man,
c8476	and selleth
c8477	him, or if he be found in his hand,
c8478	he shall surely be put to death.
c8479	And he that curseth his father, or his mother,
c8480	shall surely be put to death.
c8481	And if men strive together,
c8482	and one smite another with a stone, or with <i>his</i> fist,
c8483	and he die not,
c8484	but keepeth <i>his</i> bed:
c8485	If he rise again,
c8486	and walk abroad upon his staff,
c8487	<i>him</i> be quit:
c8488	then shall he that smote
c8489	only he shall pay <i>for</i> the loss of his time,
c8490	and shall cause <i>him</i> to be thoroughly healed.
c8491	And if a man smite his servant, or his maid, with a rod,
c8492	and he die under his hand;
c8493	he shall be surely punished.
c8494	Notwithstanding, if he continue a day or two,
c8495	he shall not be punished:
c8496	for he <i>is</i> his money.
c8497	If men strive,
c8498	and hurt a woman with child,
c8499	so that her fruit depart
c8500	<i>from her,</i> and yet no mischief follow:
c8501	he shall be surely punished,
c8502	according as the woman's husband will lay upon
c8503	him; and he shall pay as the judges <i>determine.</i>
c8504	And if <i>any</i> mischief follow,
c8505	then thou shalt give life for life,
c8506	Eye for eye,
c8507	tooth for tooth,
c8508	hand for hand,
c8509	foot for foot,
c8510	Burning for burning,
c8511	wound for wound,
c8512	stripe for stripe.
c8513	And if a man smite the eye of his servant, or the eye of his maid,
c8514	that it perish;
c8515	he shall let him go free for his eye's sake.
c8516	And if he smite out his manservant's tooth, or his maidservant's tooth;
c8517	he shall let him go free for his tooth's sake.
c8518	If an ox gore a man or a woman,
c8519	that they die:
c8520	then the ox shall be surely stoned,
c8521	and his flesh shall not be eaten;
c8522	but the owner of the ox <i>shall be</i> quit.
c8523	But if the ox were wont to push with his horn in time past,
c8524	and it hath been testified to his owner,
c8525	and he hath not kept him in,
c8526	but that he hath killed a man or a woman;
c8527	the ox shall be stoned,
c8528	and his owner also shall be put to death.
c8529	If there be laid on him a sum of money,
c8530	then he shall give for the ransom of his life whatsoever
c8531	is laid upon him.
c8532	Whether he have gored a son,
c8533	or have gored a daughter,
c8534	according to this judgment shall it be done unto him.
c8535	If the ox shall push a manservant or a maidservant;
c8536	he shall give unto their master thirty shekels of silver,
c8537	and the ox shall be stoned.
c8538	And if a man shall open a pit,
c8539	or if a man shall dig a pit,
c8540	and not cover
c8541	it, and an ox or an ass fall therein;
c8542	The owner of the pit shall make <i>it</i> good, <i>and</i> give money
c8543	unto the owner
c8544	of them; and the dead <i>beast</i> shall be his.
c8545	And if one man's ox hurt another's,
c8546	that he die;
c8547	then they shall sell the live ox,
c8548	and divide the money
c8549	of it; and the dead <i>ox</i> also they shall divide.
c8550	Or if it be known
c8551	that the ox hath used to push in time past,
c8552	and his owner hath not kept him in;
c8553	he shall surely pay ox for ox;
c8554	and the dead shall be his own.
c8555	If a man shall steal an ox, or a sheep,
c8556	and kill
c8557	it, or sell
c8558	it; he shall restore five oxen for an ox,
c8559	and four sheep for a sheep.
c8560	If a thief be found breaking up,
c8561	and be smitten
c8562	that he die,
c8563	<i>there shall</i> no blood <i>be shed</i> for him.
c8564	If the sun be risen upon
c8565	him, <i>there shall be</i> blood
c8566	<i>shed</i> for him; <i>for</i> he should make full restitution;
c8567	if he have nothing,
c8568	then he shall be sold for his theft.
c8569	If the theft be certainly found in his hand alive, whether it be ox, or ass, or sheep;
c8570	he shall restore double.
c8571	If a man shall cause a field or vineyard to be eaten,
c8572	and shall put in his beast,
c8573	and shall feed in another man's field;
c8574	of the best of his own field, and of the best of his own vineyard, shall he make restitution.
c8575	If fire break out,
c8576	and catch in thorns,
c8577	so that the stacks of corn, or the standing corn, or the field, be consumed
c8578	shall surely make restitution.
c8579	<i>therewith;</i> he that kindled the fire
c8580	If a man shall deliver unto his neighbour money or stuff
c8581	to keep,
c8582	and it be stolen out of the man's house;
c8583	if the thief be found,
c8584	let him pay double.
c8585	If the thief be not found,
c8586	then the master of the house shall be brought unto the judges,
c8587	<i>to see</i> whether he have put his hand unto his neighbour's goods.
c8588	For all manner of trespass, <i>whether it be</i> for ox, for ass, for sheep, for raiment, <i>or</i> for any manner of lost thing,
c8589	which <i>another</i> challengeth
c8590	to be his,
c8591	the cause of both parties shall come before the judges;
c8592	<i>and</i> whom the judges shall condemn,
c8593	he shall pay double unto his neighbour.
c8594	If a man deliver unto his neighbour an ass, or an ox, or a sheep, or any beast,
c8595	to keep;
c8596	and it die,
c8597	or be hurt,
c8598	or driven away,
c8599	no man seeing <i>it:</i>
c8600	<i>Then</i> shall an oath of the LORD be between them both,
c8601	that he hath not put his hand unto his neighbour's goods;
c8602	and the owner of it shall accept
c8603	<i>thereof,</i> and he shall not make <i>it</i> good.
c8604	And if it be stolen from
c8605	him, he shall make restitution unto the owner thereof.
c8606	If it be torn in pieces,
c8607	<i>then</i> let him bring it <i>for</i> witness,
c8608	<i>and</i> he shall not make good that which was torn.
c8609	And if a man borrow <i>ought</i> of his neighbour,
c8610	and it be hurt,
c8611	or die,
c8612	the owner thereof <i>being</i> not with
c8613	it, he shall surely make <i>it</i> good.
c8614	<i>But</i> if the owner thereof <i>be</i> with
c8615	it, he shall not make <i>it</i> good:
c8616	if it <i>be</i> an hired
c8617	<i>thing,</i> it came for his hire.
c8618	And if a man entice a maid
c8619	that is not betrothed,
c8620	and lie with
c8621	her, he shall surely endow her to be his wife.
c8622	If her father utterly refuse
c8623	to give
c8624	her unto him, he shall pay money according to the dowry of virgins.
c8625	Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live.
c8626	Whosoever
c8627	lieth with a beast
c8628	shall surely be put to death.
c8629	He that sacrificeth unto <i>any</i> god,
c8630	he shall be utterly destroyed.
c8631	save unto the LORD only,
c8632	Thou shalt neither vex a stranger,
c8633	nor oppress
c8634	him: for ye were strangers in the land of Egypt.
c8635	Ye shall not afflict any widow, or fatherless child.
c8636	If thou afflict them in any wise,
c8637	and they cry at all unto
c8638	me, I will surely hear their cry;
c8639	And my wrath shall wax hot,
c8640	and I will kill you with the sword;
c8641	and your wives shall be widows,
c8642	and your children fatherless.
c8643	If thou lend money to <i>any of</i> my people <i>that is</i> poor by
c8644	thee, thou shalt not be to him as an usurer,
c8645	neither shalt thou lay upon him usury.
c8646	If thou at all take thy neighbour's raiment to pledge,
c8647	it unto him by that the sun goeth down:
c8648	thou shalt deliver
c8649	For that <i>is</i> his covering only,
c8650	it <i>is</i> his raiment for his skin:
c8651	wherein shall he sleep?
c8652	and it shall come to pass,
c8653	when he crieth unto
c8654	me, that I will hear;
c8655	for I <i>am</i> gracious.
c8656	Thou shalt not revile the gods,
c8657	nor curse the ruler of thy people.
c8658	Thou shalt not delay <i>to offer</i> the first of thy ripe fruits, and of thy liquors:
c8659	the firstborn of thy sons shalt thou give unto me.
c8660	Likewise shalt thou do with thine oxen, <i>and</i> with thy sheep:
c8661	seven days it shall be with his dam;
c8662	on the eighth day thou shalt give it me.
c8663	And ye shall be holy men
c8664	<i>any</i> flesh
c8665	<i>that is</i> torn of beasts in the field;
c8666	unto me: neither shall ye eat
c8667	ye shall cast it to the dogs.
c8668	Thou shalt not raise a false report:
c8669	put not thine hand with the wicked
c8670	to be an unrighteous witness.
c8671	Thou shalt not follow a multitude to <i>do</i> evil;
c8672	neither shalt thou speak in a cause
c8673	to decline after many
c8674	to wrest <i>judgment:</i>
c8675	Neither shalt thou countenance a poor man in his cause.
c8676	If thou meet thine enemy's ox or his ass
c8677	going astray,
c8678	thou shalt surely bring it back to him again.
c8679	If thou see the ass of him that hateth
c8680	thee lying under his burden,
c8681	and wouldest forbear
c8682	to help
c8683	him, thou shalt surely help with him.
c8684	Thou shalt not wrest the judgment of thy poor in his cause.
c8685	Keep thee far from a false matter;
c8686	and the innocent and righteous slay thou not:
c8687	for I will not justify the wicked.
c8688	And thou shalt take no gift:
c8689	for the gift blindeth the wise,
c8690	and perverteth the words of the righteous.
c8691	Also thou shalt not oppress a stranger:
c8692	for ye know the heart of a stranger,
c8693	seeing ye were strangers in the land of Egypt.
c8694	And six years thou shalt sow thy land,
c8695	and shalt gather in the fruits thereof:
c8696	But the seventh <i>year</i> thou shalt let it rest
c8697	and lie still;
c8698	that the poor of thy people may eat:
c8699	and what they leave the beasts of the field shall eat.
c8700	In like manner thou shalt deal with thy vineyard, <i>and</i> with thy oliveyard.
c8701	Six days thou shalt do thy work,
c8702	and on the seventh day thou shalt rest:
c8703	that thine ox and thine ass may rest,
c8704	and the son of thy handmaid, and the stranger, may be refreshed.
c8705	And in all
c8706	<i>things</i> that I have said unto
c8707	you be circumspect:
c8708	and make no mention of the name of other gods,
c8709	neither let it be heard out of thy mouth.
c8710	Three times thou shalt keep a feast unto me in the year.
c8711	Thou shalt keep the feast of unleavened bread:
c8712	(thou shalt eat unleavened bread seven days,
c8713	as I commanded
c8714	thee, in the time appointed of the month Abib;
c8715	for in it thou camest out from Egypt:
c8716	and none shall appear before me empty:)
c8717	And the feast of harvest, the firstfruits of thy labours,
c8718	which thou hast sown in the field:
c8719	and the feast of ingathering,
c8720	<i>which is</i> in the end of the year,
c8721	when thou hast gathered in thy labours out of the field.
c8722	Three times in the year all thy males shall appear before the Lord GOD.
c8723	Thou shalt not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leavened bread;
c8724	neither shall the fat of my sacrifice remain until the morning.
c8725	The first of the firstfruits of thy land thou shalt bring into the house of the LORD thy God.
c8726	Thou shalt not seethe a kid in his mother's milk.
c8727	Behold, I send an Angel before
c8728	thee, to keep thee in the way,
c8729	and to bring thee into the place
c8730	which I have prepared.
c8731	Beware of
c8732	him, and obey his voice,
c8733	provoke him not;
c8734	for he will not pardon your transgressions:
c8735	for my name <i>is</i> in him.
c8736	But
c8737	if thou shalt indeed obey his voice,
c8738	and do all
c8739	that I speak;
c8740	then I will be an enemy unto thine enemies,
c8741	and an adversary unto thine adversaries.
c8742	For mine Angel shall go before
c8743	thee, and bring thee in unto the Amorites, and the Hittites, and the Perizzites, and the Canaanites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites:
c8744	and I will cut them off.
c8745	Thou shalt not bow down to their gods,
c8746	nor serve
c8747	them, nor do after their works:
c8748	but thou shalt utterly overthrow
c8749	them, and quite break down their images.
c8750	And ye shall serve the LORD your God,
c8751	and he shall bless thy bread, and thy water;
c8752	and I will take sickness away from the midst of thee.
c8753	There shall nothing cast their young, nor be barren, in thy land:
c8754	the number of thy days I will fulfil.
c8755	I will send my fear before
c8756	thee, and will destroy all the people
c8757	to whom thou shalt come,
c8758	and I will make all thine enemies turn their backs unto thee.
c8759	And I will send hornets before
c8760	thee, which shall drive out the Hivite, the Canaanite, and the Hittite, from before thee.
c8761	I will not drive them out from before thee in one year;
c8762	lest the land become desolate,
c8763	and the beast of the field multiply against thee.
c8764	By little and little I will drive them out from before
c8765	thee, until thou be increased,
c8766	and inherit the land.
c8767	And I will set thy bounds from the Red sea even unto the sea of the Philistines, and from the desert unto the river:
c8768	for I will deliver the inhabitants of the land into your hand;
c8769	and thou shalt drive them out before thee.
c8770	Thou shalt make no covenant with them, nor with their gods.
c8771	They shall not dwell in thy land,
c8772	lest they make thee sin
c8773	against me: for if thou serve their gods,
c8774	it will surely be a snare unto thee.
c8775	And he said unto Moses,
c8776	Come up unto the LORD, thou, and Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel;
c8777	and worship ye afar off.
c8778	And Moses alone shall come near the LORD:
c8779	but they shall not come nigh;
c8780	neither shall the people go up with him.
c8781	And Moses came
c8782	and told the people all the words of the LORD, and all the judgments:
c8783	and all the people answered with one voice,
c8784	and said,
c8785	All the words
c8786	which the LORD hath said
c8787	will we do.
c8788	And Moses wrote all the words of the LORD,
c8789	and rose up early in the morning,
c8790	and builded an altar under the hill,
c8791	and twelve pillars, according to the twelve tribes of Israel.
c8792	And he sent young men of the children of Israel,
c8793	which offered burnt offerings,
c8794	and sacrificed peace offerings of oxen unto the LORD.
c8795	And Moses took half of the blood,
c8796	and put <i>it</i> in basons;
c8797	and half of the blood he sprinkled on the altar.
c8798	And he took the book of the covenant,
c8799	and read in the audience of the people:
c8800	and they said,
c8801	All
c8802	that the LORD hath said
c8803	will we do,
c8804	and be obedient.
c8805	And Moses took the blood,
c8806	and sprinkled <i>it</i> on the people,
c8807	and said,
c8808	Behold the blood of the covenant,
c8809	which the LORD hath made with you concerning all these words.
c8810	Then went up Moses, and Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel:
c8811	And they saw the God of Israel:
c8812	and <i>there was</i> under his feet as it were a paved work of a sapphire stone,
c8813	and as it were the body of heaven in <i>his</i> clearness.
c8814	And upon the nobles of the children of Israel he laid not his hand:
c8815	also they saw God,
c8816	and did eat
c8817	and drink.
c8818	And the LORD said unto Moses,
c8819	Come up to me into the mount,
c8820	and be there:
c8821	and I will give thee tables of stone, and a law, and commandments
c8822	which I have written;
c8823	that thou mayest teach them.
c8824	And Moses rose up, and his minister Joshua:
c8825	and Moses went up into the mount of God.
c8826	And he said unto the elders,
c8827	Tarry ye here
c8828	for us, until we come again unto
c8829	you: and, behold,
c8830	Aaron and Hur <i>are</i> with
c8831	you: if any man have any matters
c8832	to do, let him come unto them.
c8833	And Moses went up into the mount,
c8834	and a cloud covered the mount.
c8835	And the glory of the LORD abode upon mount Sinai,
c8836	and the cloud covered it six days:
c8837	and the seventh day he called unto Moses out of the midst of the cloud.
c8838	And the sight of the glory of the LORD <i>was</i> like devouring fire on the top of the mount in the eyes of the children of Israel.
c8839	And Moses went into the midst of the cloud,
c8840	and gat him up into the mount:
c8841	and Moses was in the mount forty days and forty nights.
c8842	And the LORD spake unto Moses,
c8843	saying,
c8844	Speak unto the children of Israel,
c8845	that they bring me an offering:
c8846	of every man
c8847	that giveth it willingly with his heart
c8848	ye shall take my offering.
c8849	And this <i>is</i> the offering
c8850	which ye shall take of
c8851	them; gold, and silver, and brass,
c8852	And blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine linen, and goats' <i>hair,</i>
c8853	And rams' skins dyed red, and badgers' skins, and shittim wood,
c8854	Oil for the light, spices for anointing oil, and for sweet incense,
c8855	Onyx stones, and stones to be set in the ephod, and in the breastplate.
c8856	And let them make me a sanctuary;
c8857	that I may dwell among them.
c8858	According to all
c8859	that I shew thee, <i>after</i> the pattern of the tabernacle, and the pattern of all the instruments
c8860	thereof, even so shall ye make <i>it.</i>
c8861	And they shall make an ark <i>of</i> shittim wood:
c8862	two cubits and a half <i>shall be</i> the length
c8863	thereof, and a cubit and a half the breadth
c8864	thereof, and a cubit and a half the height thereof.
c8865	And thou shalt overlay it with pure gold,
c8866	within and without shalt thou overlay
c8867	it, and shalt make upon it a crown of gold round about.
c8868	And thou shalt cast four rings of gold
c8869	for it, and put <i>them</i> in the four corners
c8870	thereof; and two rings <i>shall be</i> in the one side
c8871	of it, and two rings in the other side of it.
c8872	And thou shalt make staves <i>of</i> shittim wood,
c8873	and overlay them with gold.
c8874	And thou shalt put the staves into the rings by the sides of the ark,
c8875	that the ark may be borne with them.
c8876	The staves shall be in the rings of the ark:
c8877	they shall not be taken from it.
c8878	And thou shalt put into the ark the testimony
c8879	which I shall give thee.
c8880	And thou shalt make a mercy seat <i>of</i> pure gold:
c8881	two cubits and a half <i>shall be</i> the length
c8882	thereof, and a cubit and a half the breadth thereof.
c8883	And thou shalt make two cherubims <i>of</i> gold,
c8884	<i>of</i> beaten work shalt thou make them, in the two ends of the mercy seat.
c8885	And make one cherub on the one end,
c8886	and the other cherub on the other end:
c8887	<i>even</i> of the mercy seat shall ye make the cherubims on the two ends thereof.
c8888	And the cherubims shall stretch forth <i>their</i> wings on high,
c8889	covering the mercy seat with their wings,
c8890	and their faces <i>shall look</i> one to another;
c8891	toward the mercy seat shall the faces of the cherubims be.
c8892	And thou shalt put the mercy seat above upon the ark;
c8893	and in the ark thou shalt put the testimony
c8894	that I shall give thee.
c8895	And there I will meet
c8896	with thee, and I will commune with thee from above the mercy seat, from between the two cherubims
c8897	which <i>are</i> upon the ark of the testimony,
c8898	of all
c8899	<i>things</i> which I will give thee in commandment unto the children of Israel.
c8900	Thou shalt also make a table <i>of</i> shittim wood:
c8901	two cubits <i>shall be</i> the length
c8902	thereof, and a cubit the breadth
c8903	thereof, and a cubit and a half the height thereof.
c8904	And thou shalt overlay it with pure gold,
c8905	and make thereto a crown of gold round about.
c8906	And thou shalt make unto it a border of an hand breadth round about,
c8907	and thou shalt make a golden crown to the border thereof round about.
c8908	And thou shalt make for it four rings of gold,
c8909	and put the rings in the four corners
c8910	that <i>are</i> on the four feet thereof.
c8911	Over against the border shall the rings be for places of the staves
c8912	to bear the table.
c8913	And thou shalt make the staves <i>of</i> shittim wood,
c8914	and overlay them with gold,
c8915	that the table may be borne with them.
c8916	And thou shalt make the dishes thereof, and spoons thereof, and covers thereof, and bowls
c8917	thereof, to cover withal:
c8918	<i>of</i> pure gold shalt thou make them.
c8919	And thou shalt set upon the table shewbread before me alway.
c8920	And thou shalt make a candlestick <i>of</i> pure gold:
c8921	<i>of</i> beaten work shall the candlestick be made: his shaft, and his branches,
c8922	his bowls, his knops, and his flowers, shall be of the same.
c8923	And six branches shall come out of the sides
c8924	of it; three branches of the candlestick out of the one side,
c8925	and three branches of the candlestick out of the other side:
c8926	Three bowls made like unto almonds, <i>with</i> a knop and a flower in one branch;
c8928	and three bowls made like almonds in the other branch,
c8929	<i>with</i> a knop and a flower:
c8930	so in the six branches
c8931	that come out of the candlestick.
c8932	And in the candlestick <i>shall be</i> four bowls made like unto almonds,
c8933	<i>with</i> their knops and their flowers.
c8934	And <i>there shall be</i> a knop under two branches of
c8935	the same, and a knop under two branches of
c8936	the same, and a knop under two branches of
c8937	the same, according to the six branches
c8938	that proceed out of the candlestick.
c8939	Their knops and their branches shall be of
c8940	the same: all it <i>shall be</i> one beaten work <i>of</i> pure gold.
c8941	And thou shalt make the seven lamps
c8942	thereof: and they shall light the lamps
c8943	thereof, that they may give light over against it.
c8944	And the tongs thereof, and the snuffdishes thereof, <i>shall be of</i> pure gold.
c8945	<i>Of</i> a talent of pure gold shall he make it, with all these vessels.
c8946	And look
c8947	that thou make <i>them</i> after their pattern,
c8948	which was shewed thee in the mount.
c8949	Moreover thou shalt make the tabernacle <i>with</i> ten curtains
c8950	<i>of</i> fine twined linen, and blue, and purple, and scarlet: <i>with</i> cherubims of cunning work shalt thou make them.
c8951	The length of one curtain <i>shall be</i> eight and twenty cubits,
c8952	and the breadth of one curtain four cubits:
c8953	and every one of the curtains shall have one measure.
c8954	The five curtains shall be coupled together
c8955	one to another;
c8956	and <i>other</i> five curtains <i>shall be</i> coupled
c8957	one to another.
c8958	And thou shalt make loops of blue upon the edge of the one curtain from the selvedge in the coupling;
c8959	and likewise shalt thou make in the uttermost edge of <i>another</i> curtain, in the coupling of the second.
c8960	Fifty loops shalt thou make in the one curtain,
c8961	and fifty loops shalt thou make in the edge of the curtain
c8962	that <i>is</i> in the coupling of the second;
c8963	that the loops may take hold
c8964	one of another.
c8965	And thou shalt make fifty taches of gold,
c8966	and couple the curtains
c8967	together
c8968	with the taches:
c8969	and it shall be one tabernacle.
c8970	And thou shalt make curtains <i>of</i> goats' <i>hair</i> to be a covering upon the tabernacle:
c8971	eleven curtains shalt thou make.
c8972	The length of one curtain <i>shall be</i> thirty cubits,
c8973	and the breadth of one curtain four cubits:
c8974	and the eleven curtains <i>shall be all</i> of one measure.
c8975	And thou shalt couple five curtains by themselves, and six curtains by themselves,
c8976	and shalt double the sixth curtain in the forefront of the tabernacle.
c8977	And thou shalt make fifty loops on the edge of the one curtain <i>that is</i> outmost in the coupling,
c8978	and fifty loops in the edge of the curtain which coupleth the second.
c8979	And thou shalt make fifty taches of brass,
c8980	and put the taches into the loops,
c8981	and couple the tent together,
c8982	that it may be one.
c8983	And the remnant
c8984	that remaineth of the curtains of the tent,
c8985	the half curtain
c8986	that remaineth,
c8987	shall hang over the backside of the tabernacle.
c8988	And a cubit on the one side, and a cubit on the other side
c8989	of that which remaineth in the length of the curtains of the tent,
c8990	it shall hang over the sides of the tabernacle on this side and on that side,
c8991	to cover it.
c8992	And thou shalt make a covering for the tent <i>of</i> rams' skins dyed red,
c8993	and a covering above <i>of</i> badgers' skins.
c8994	And thou shalt make boards for the tabernacle <i>of</i> shittim wood standing up.
c8995	Ten cubits <i>shall be</i> the length of a board,
c8996	and a cubit and a half <i>shall be</i> the breadth of one board.
c8997	Two tenons <i>shall there be</i> in one board,
c8998	set in order
c8999	one against another:
c9000	thus shalt thou make for all the boards of the tabernacle.
c9001	And thou shalt make the boards for the tabernacle,
c9002	twenty boards on the south side southward.
c9003	And thou shalt make forty sockets of silver under the twenty boards;
c9004	two sockets under one board for his two tenons,
c9005	and two sockets under another board for his two tenons.
c9006	And for the second side of the tabernacle on the north side <i>there shall be</i> twenty boards:
c9007	And their forty sockets <i>of</i> silver;
c9008	two sockets under one board,
c9009	and two sockets under another board.
c9010	And for the sides of the tabernacle westward thou shalt make six boards.
c9011	And two boards shalt thou make for the corners of the tabernacle in the two sides.
c9012	And they shall be coupled together beneath,
c9013	and they shall be coupled together above the head of it unto one ring:
c9014	thus shall it be for them both;
c9015	they shall be for the two corners.
c9016	And they shall be eight boards, and their sockets <i>of</i> silver, sixteen sockets;
c9017	two sockets under one board,
c9018	and two sockets under another board.
c9019	And thou shalt make bars <i>of</i> shittim wood; five for the boards of the one side of the tabernacle,
c9020	And five bars for the boards of the other side of the tabernacle,
c9021	and five bars for the boards of the side of the tabernacle, for the two sides westward.
c9022	And the middle bar in the midst of the boards

c9024	And thou shalt overlay the boards with gold,
c9025	and make their rings <i>of</i> gold
c9026	<i>for</i> places for the bars:
c9027	and thou shalt overlay the bars with gold.
c9028	And thou shalt rear up the tabernacle according to the fashion
c9029	thereof which was shewed thee in the mount.
c9030	And thou shalt make a vail <i>of</i> blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen
c9031	of cunning work: with cherubims shall it be made:
c9033	And thou shalt hang it upon four pillars of shittim
c9034	<i>wood</i> overlaid with gold:
c9035	their hooks <i>shall be of</i> gold,
c9036	upon the four sockets of silver.
c9037	And thou shalt hang up the vail under the taches,
c9038	that thou mayest bring in thither within the vail the ark of the testimony:
c9039	and the vail shall divide unto you between the holy <i>place</i> and the most holy.
c9040	And thou shalt put the mercy seat upon the ark of the testimony in the most holy <i>place.</i>
c9041	And thou shalt set the table without the vail,
c9042	and the candlestick over against the table on the side of the tabernacle toward the south:
c9043	and thou shalt put the table on the north side.
c9044	And thou shalt make an hanging for the door of the tent, <i>of</i> blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen,

c9098	All the pillars round about the court <i>shall be</i> filleted with silver;

c9106	thereof, and all the pins thereof, and all the pins of the court, <i>shall be of</i> brass.
c9107	And thou shalt command the children of Israel,
c9108	that they bring thee pure oil olive beaten for the light,
c9109	to cause the lamp to burn always.
c9110	In the tabernacle of the congregation without the vail,
c9111	which <i>is</i> before the testimony,
c9112	Aaron and his sons shall order it from evening to morning before the LORD:
c9113	<i>it shall be</i> a statute for ever unto their generations on the behalf of the children of Israel.
c9114	And take thou unto thee Aaron thy brother,
c9115	and his sons with
c9116	him, from among the children of Israel,
c9117	that he may minister unto me in the priest's office, <i>even</i> Aaron, Nadab and Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar, Aaron's sons.
c9118	And thou shalt make holy garments for Aaron thy brother for glory and for beauty.
c9119	And thou shalt speak unto all <i>that are</i> wise hearted,
c9120	whom I have filled with the spirit of wisdom,
c9121	that they may make Aaron's garments
c9122	to consecrate
c9123	him, that he may minister unto me in the priest's office.
c9124	And these <i>are</i> the garments
c9125	which they shall make;
c9126	a breastplate, and an ephod, and a robe, and a broidered coat, a mitre, and a girdle:
c9127	and they shall make holy garments for Aaron thy brother, and his sons,
c9128	that he may minister unto me in the priest's office.
c9129	And they shall take gold, and blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine linen.
c9130	And they shall make the ephod <i>of</i> gold, <i>of</i> blue, and <i>of</i> purple, <i>of</i> scarlet, and fine twined linen,
c9131	with cunning work.
c9132	It shall have the two shoulderpieces thereof joined at the two edges
c9133	thereof; and <i>so</i> it shall be joined together.
c9134	And the curious girdle of the ephod,
c9135	which <i>is</i> upon
c9136	the same, according to the work
c9137	it, shall be of
c9138	thereof; <i>even of</i> gold, <i>of</i> blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen.
c9139	And thou shalt take two onyx stones,
c9140	and grave on them the names of the children of Israel:
c9141	Six of their names on one stone,
c9142	and <i>the other</i> six names of the rest on the other stone,
c9143	according to their birth.
c9144	With the work of an engraver in stone, <i>like</i> the engravings of a signet, shalt thou engrave the two stones with the names of the children of Israel:
c9145	thou shalt make them to be set in ouches of gold.
c9146	And thou shalt put the two stones upon the shoulders of the ephod <i>for</i> stones of memorial unto the children of Israel:
c9147	and Aaron shall bear their names before the LORD upon his two shoulders for a memorial.
c9148	And thou shalt make ouches <i>of</i> gold;
c9149	And two chains <i>of</i> pure gold
c9150	at the ends; <i>of</i> wreathen work shalt thou make
c9151	them, and fasten the wreathen chains to the ouches.
c9152	And thou shalt make the breastplate of judgment with cunning work;
c9153	after the work of the ephod thou shalt make
c9154	it; <i>of</i> gold, <i>of</i> blue, and <i>of</i> purple, and <i>of</i> scarlet, and <i>of</i> fine twined linen, shalt thou make it.
c9155	Foursquare it shall be
c9156	<i>being</i> doubled;
c9157	a span <i>shall be</i> the length
c9158	thereof, and a span <i>shall be</i> the breadth thereof.
c9159	And thou shalt set in it settings of stones, <i>even</i> four rows of stones:
c9160	<i>the first</i> row <i>shall be</i> a sardius, a topaz, and a carbuncle: <i>this shall be</i> the first row.
c9161	And the second row <i>shall be</i> an emerald, a sapphire, and a diamond.
c9162	And the third row a ligure, an agate, and an amethyst.
c9163	And the fourth row a beryl, and an onyx, and a jasper:
c9165	they shall be set in gold in their inclosings.
c9166	And the stones shall be with the names of the children of Israel, twelve, according to their names,
c9167	<i>like</i> the engravings of a signet;
c9168	every one with his name
c9169	shall they be according to the twelve tribes.
c9170	And thou shalt make upon the breastplate chains at the ends <i>of</i> wreathen work <i>of</i> pure gold.
c9171	And thou shalt make upon the breastplate two rings of gold,
c9172	and shalt put the two rings on the two ends of the breastplate.
c9173	And thou shalt put the two wreathen <i>chains</i> of gold in the two rings <i>which are</i> on the ends of the breastplate.
c9174	And <i>the other</i> two ends of the two wreathen <i>chains</i> thou shalt fasten in the two ouches,
c9175	and put <i>them</i> on the shoulderpieces of the ephod before it.
c9176	And thou shalt make two rings of gold,
c9177	and thou shalt put them upon the two ends of the breastplate in the border
c9178	thereof, which <i>is</i> in the side of the ephod
c9179	inward.
c9180	And two <i>other</i> rings of gold thou shalt make,
c9181	and shalt put them on the two sides of the ephod underneath, toward the forepart thereof, over against the <i>other</i> coupling thereof, above the curious girdle of the ephod.
c9182	And they shall bind the breastplate by the rings thereof unto the rings of the ephod with a lace of blue,
c9183	that <i>it</i> may be above the curious girdle of the ephod,
c9184	and that the breastplate be not loosed from the ephod.
c9185	And Aaron shall bear the names of the children of Israel in the breastplate of judgment upon his heart,
c9186	when he goeth in unto the holy
c9187	<i>place,</i> for a memorial before the LORD continually.
c9188	And thou shalt put in the breastplate of judgment the Urim and the Thummim;
c9189	and they shall be upon Aaron's heart,
c9190	when he goeth in before the LORD:
c9191	and Aaron shall bear the judgment of the children of Israel upon his heart before the LORD continually.
c9192	And thou shalt make the robe of the ephod all <i>of</i> blue.
c9193	And there shall be an hole in the top of it, in the midst
c9194	thereof: it shall have a binding of woven work round about the hole
c9195	of it, as it were the hole of an habergeon, that it be
c9196	not rent.
c9197	And <i>beneath</i> upon the hem of it thou shalt make pomegranates <i>of</i> blue, and <i>of</i> purple, and <i>of</i> scarlet,
c9198	round about the hem
c9199	thereof; and bells of gold between them round about:
c9200	A golden bell and a pomegranate, a golden bell and a pomegranate, upon the hem of the robe round about.
c9201	And it shall be upon Aaron
c9202	to minister:
c9203	and his sound shall be heard
c9204	when he goeth in unto the holy <i>place</i> before the LORD,
c9205	and when he cometh out,
c9206	that he die not.
c9207	And thou shalt make a plate <i>of</i> pure gold,
c9208	and grave upon it, <i>like</i> the engravings of a signet,
c9209	HOLINESS TO THE LORD.
c9210	And thou shalt put it on a blue lace,
c9211	that it may be upon the mitre;
c9212	upon the forefront of the mitre it shall be.
c9213	And it shall be upon Aaron's forehead,
c9214	that Aaron may bear the iniquity of the holy things,
c9215	which the children of Israel shall hallow in all their holy gifts;
c9216	and it shall be always upon his forehead, that they may be accepted before the LORD.
c9217	And thou shalt embroider the coat of fine linen,
c9218	and thou shalt make the mitre <i>of</i> fine linen,
c9219	and thou shalt make the girdle <i>of</i> needlework.
c9220	And for Aaron's sons thou shalt make coats,
c9221	and thou shalt make for them girdles,
c9222	and bonnets shalt thou make for them, for glory and for beauty.
c9223	And thou shalt put them upon Aaron thy brother, and his sons with
c9224	him; and shalt anoint
c9225	them, and consecrate
c9226	them, and sanctify
c9227	them, that they may minister unto me in the priest's office.
c9228	And thou shalt make them linen breeches
c9229	to cover their nakedness;
c9230	from the loins even unto the thighs they shall reach:
c9231	And they shall be upon Aaron, and upon his sons,
c9232	when they come in unto the tabernacle of the congregation,
c9233	or when they come near unto the altar
c9234	to minister in the holy
c9235	<i>place;</i> that they bear not iniquity,
c9236	and die:
c9237	<i>it shall be</i> a statute for ever unto him and his seed after him.
c9238	And this <i>is</i> the thing
c9239	that thou shalt do
c9240	unto them to hallow
c9241	them, to minister unto me in the priest's office:
c9242	Take one young bullock, and two rams without blemish,
c9243	And unleavened bread, and cakes unleavened
c9244	tempered with oil,
c9245	and wafers unleavened
c9246	anointed with oil:
c9247	<i>of</i> wheaten flour shalt thou make them.
c9248	And thou shalt put them into one basket,
c9249	and bring them in the basket,
c9250	with the bullock and the two rams.
c9251	And Aaron and his sons thou shalt bring unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation,
c9252	and shalt wash them with water.
c9253	And thou shalt take the garments,
c9254	and put upon Aaron the coat, and the robe of the ephod, and the ephod, and the breastplate,
c9255	and gird him with the curious girdle of the ephod:
c9256	And thou shalt put the mitre upon his head,
c9257	and put the holy crown upon the mitre.
c9258	Then shalt thou take the anointing oil,
c9259	and pour <i>it</i> upon his head,
c9260	and anoint him.
c9261	And thou shalt bring his sons,
c9262	and put coats upon them.
c9263	And thou shalt gird them with girdles, Aaron and his sons,
c9264	and put the bonnets
c9265	on them: and the priest's office shall be theirs for a perpetual statute:
c9266	and thou shalt consecrate Aaron and his sons.
c9267	And thou shalt cause a bullock to be brought before the tabernacle of the congregation:
c9268	and Aaron and his sons shall put their hands upon the head of the bullock.
c9269	And thou shalt kill the bullock before the LORD, <i>by</i> the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.
c9270	And thou shalt take of the blood of the bullock,
c9271	and put <i>it</i> upon the horns of the altar with thy finger,
c9272	and pour all the blood beside the bottom of the altar.
c9273	And thou shalt take all the fat
c9274	that covereth the inwards,
c9275	and the caul <i>that is</i> above the liver, and the two kidneys, and the fat
c9276	that <i>is</i> upon
c9277	them, and burn <i>them</i> upon the altar.
c9278	But the flesh of the bullock, and his skin, and his dung, shalt thou burn with fire without the camp:
c9279	it <i>is</i> a sin offering.
c9280	Thou shalt also take one ram;
c9281	and Aaron and his sons shall put their hands upon the head of the ram.
c9282	And thou shalt slay the ram,
c9283	and thou shalt take his blood,
c9284	and sprinkle <i>it</i> round about upon the altar.
c9285	And thou shalt cut the ram in pieces,
c9286	and wash the inwards of him, and his legs,
c9287	and put <i>them</i> unto his pieces, and unto his head.
c9288	And thou shalt burn the whole ram upon the altar:
c9289	it <i>is</i> a burnt offering unto the LORD: it <i>is</i> a sweet savour,
c9290	an offering made by fire unto the LORD.
c9291	And thou shalt take the other ram;
c9292	and Aaron and his sons shall put their hands upon the head of the ram.
c9293	Then shalt thou kill the ram,
c9294	and take of his blood,
c9295	and put <i>it</i> upon the tip of the right ear of Aaron, and upon the tip of the right ear of his sons, and upon the thumb of their right hand, and upon the great toe of their right foot,
c9296	and sprinkle the blood upon the altar round about.
c9297	And thou shalt take of the blood
c9298	that <i>is</i> upon the altar,
c9299	and of the anointing oil,
c9300	and sprinkle <i>it</i> upon Aaron, and upon his garments, and upon his sons, and upon the garments of his sons with
c9301	him: and he shall be hallowed, and his garments, and his sons, and his sons' garments with him.
c9302	Also thou shalt take of the ram the fat and the rump, and the fat
c9303	that covereth the inwards,
c9304	and the caul <i>above</i> the liver, and the two kidneys, and the fat
c9305	that <i>is</i> upon
c9306	them, and the right shoulder;
c9307	for it <i>is</i> a ram of consecration:
c9308	And one loaf of bread, and one cake of oiled bread, and one wafer out of the basket of the unleavened bread
c9309	that <i>is</i> before the LORD:
c9310	And thou shalt put all in the hands of Aaron, and in the hands of his sons;
c9311	and shalt wave them <i>for</i> a wave offering before the LORD.
c9312	And thou shalt receive them of their hands,
c9313	and burn <i>them</i> upon the altar for a burnt offering, for a sweet savour before the LORD:
c9314	it <i>is</i> an offering made by fire unto the LORD.
c9315	And thou shalt take the breast of the ram of Aaron's consecration,
c9317	and wave it <i>for</i> a wave offering before the LORD:
c9318	and it shall be thy part.
c9319	And thou shalt sanctify the breast of the wave offering, and the shoulder of the heave offering,
c9320	which is waved,
c9321	and which is heaved up, of the ram of the consecration,
c9322	<i>even</i> of <i>that</i> which <i>is</i> for Aaron,
c9323	and of <i>that</i> which is for his sons:
c9324	And it shall be Aaron's and his sons' by a statute for ever from the children of Israel:
c9325	for it <i>is</i> an heave offering:
c9326	and it shall be an heave offering from the children of Israel of the sacrifice of their peace offerings,
c9327	<i>even</i> their heave offering unto the LORD.
c9328	And the holy garments
c9329	of Aaron
c9330	shall be his sons' after him, to be anointed
c9331	therein, and to be consecrated in them.
c9332	<i>And</i> that son that is priest in his stead shall put them on seven days,
c9333	when he cometh into the tabernacle of the congregation
c9334	to minister in the holy <i>place.</i>
c9335	And thou shalt take the ram of the consecration,
c9336	and seethe his flesh in the holy place.
c9337	And Aaron and his sons shall eat the flesh of the ram, and the bread
c9338	that <i>is</i> in the basket,
c9339	<i>by</i> the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.
c9340	And they shall eat
c9341	those things wherewith the atonement was made,
c9342	to consecrate
c9343	<i>and</i> to sanctify
c9344	them: but a stranger shall not eat
c9345	<i>thereof,</i> because they <i>are</i> holy.
c9346	And if ought of the flesh of the consecrations, or of the bread, remain unto the morning,
c9347	then thou shalt burn the remainder with fire:
c9348	it shall not be eaten,
c9349	because it <i>is</i> holy.
c9350	And thus shalt thou do unto Aaron, and to his sons,
c9351	according to all
c9352	<i>things</i> which I have commanded
c9353	thee: seven days shalt thou consecrate them.
c9354	And thou shalt offer every day a bullock <i>for</i> a sin offering for atonement:
c9355	and thou shalt cleanse the altar, when thou hast made an atonement
c9356	for
c9357	it, and thou shalt anoint
c9358	it, to sanctify it.
c9359	Seven days thou shalt make an atonement for the altar,
c9360	and sanctify
c9361	it; and it shall be an altar most holy:
c9362	whatsoever
c9363	toucheth the altar
c9364	shall be holy.
c9365	Now this
c9366	<i>is that</i> which thou shalt offer upon the altar;
c9367	two lambs of the first year day by day continually.
c9368	The one lamb thou shalt offer in the morning;
c9369	and the other lamb thou shalt offer at even:
c9371	mingled with the fourth part of an hin of beaten oil; and the fourth part of an hin of wine <i>for</i> a drink offering.
c9372	And with the one lamb a tenth deal of flour
c9373	And the other lamb thou shalt offer at even,
c9374	and shalt do thereto according to the meat offering of the morning, and according to the drink offering thereof, for a sweet savour, an offering made by fire unto the LORD.
c9375	<i>This shall be</i> a continual burnt offering throughout your generations <i>at</i> the door of the tabernacle of the congregation before the LORD:
c9376	where I will meet
c9377	you, to speak there unto thee.
c9378	And there I will meet with the children of Israel,
c9379	and <i>the tabernacle</i> shall be sanctified by my glory.
c9380	And I will sanctify the tabernacle of the congregation, and the altar:
c9381	I will sanctify also both Aaron and his sons,
c9382	to minister to me in the priest's office.
c9383	And I will dwell among the children of Israel,
c9384	and will be their God.
c9385	And they shall know
c9386	that I <i>am</i> the LORD their God,
c9387	that brought them forth out of the land of Egypt,
c9388	that I may dwell among
c9389	them: I <i>am</i> the LORD their God.
c9390	And thou shalt make an altar to burn incense
c9391	upon: <i>of</i> shittim wood shalt thou make it.
c9392	A cubit <i>shall be</i> the length
c9393	thereof, and a cubit the breadth
c9394	thereof; foursquare shall it be:
c9395	and two cubits <i>shall be</i> the height
c9396	thereof: the horns thereof <i>shall be</i> of the same.
c9397	And thou shalt overlay it with pure gold, the top thereof, and the sides thereof round about, and the horns
c9398	thereof; and thou shalt make unto it a crown of gold round about.
c9399	And two golden rings shalt thou make to it under the crown
c9400	of it, by the two corners thereof, upon the two sides of it shalt thou make
c9401	<i>it;</i> and they shall be for places for the staves
c9402	to bear it withal.
c9403	And thou shalt make the staves <i>of</i> shittim wood,
c9404	and overlay them with gold.
c9405	And thou shalt put it before the vail
c9406	that <i>is</i> by the ark of the testimony,
c9407	before the mercy seat
c9408	that <i>is</i> over the testimony,
c9409	where I will meet with thee.
c9410	And Aaron shall burn thereon sweet incense
c9411	every morning:
c9412	when he dresseth the lamps,
c9413	he shall burn incense upon it.
c9415	And when Aaron lighteth the lamps at even,
c9416	he shall burn incense
c9417	upon it, a perpetual incense before the LORD throughout your generations.
c9418	Ye shall offer no strange incense thereon, nor burnt sacrifice, nor meat offering;
c9419	neither shall ye pour drink offering thereon.
c9420	And Aaron shall make an atonement upon the horns of it once in a year with the blood of the sin offering of atonements:
c9421	once in the year shall he make atonement upon it throughout your generations:
c9422	it <i>is</i> most holy unto the LORD.
c9423	And the LORD spake unto Moses,
c9424	saying,
c9425	When thou takest the sum of the children of Israel after their number,
c9426	then shall they give
c9427	every man a ransom for his soul
c9428	unto the LORD,
c9429	when thou numberest
c9430	them; that there be no plague
c9431	among them, when <i>thou</i> numberest them.
c9432	This they shall give, every one
c9433	that passeth among them that are numbered,
c9434	half a shekel after the shekel of the sanctuary:
c9435	(a shekel <i>is</i> twenty gerahs:)
c9436	an half shekel <i>shall be</i> the offering of the LORD.
c9437	Every one
c9438	that passeth among them that are numbered,
c9439	from twenty years old and above, shall give an offering unto the LORD.
c9440	The rich shall not give more,
c9441	and the poor shall not give less than half a shekel,
c9442	when <i>they</i> give an offering unto the LORD,
c9443	to make an atonement for your souls.
c9444	And thou shalt take the atonement money of the children of Israel, and shalt appoint it for the service of the tabernacle of the congregation;
c9446	that it may be a memorial unto the children of Israel before the LORD, to make an atonement
c9447	for your souls.
c9448	And the LORD spake unto Moses,
c9449	saying,
c9450	Thou shalt also make a laver <i>of</i> brass,
c9451	and his foot <i>also of</i> brass,
c9452	to wash
c9453	<i>withal:</i> and thou shalt put it between the tabernacle of the congregation and the altar,
c9454	and thou shalt put water therein.
c9455	For Aaron and his sons shall wash their hands and their feet thereat:
c9456	When they go into the tabernacle of the congregation,
c9457	they shall wash with water,
c9458	that they die not;
c9459	or when they come near to the altar
c9460	to minister,
c9461	to burn offering made by fire unto the LORD:
c9462	So they shall wash their hands and their feet,
c9463	that they die not:
c9464	and it shall be a statute for ever to them, <i>even</i> to him and to his seed throughout their generations.
c9465	Moreover the LORD spake unto Moses,
c9466	saying,
c9467	Take thou also unto thee principal spices, of pure myrrh five hundred <i>shekels,</i> and of sweet cinnamon half so much, <i>even</i> two hundred and fifty <i>shekels,</i> and of sweet calamus two hundred and fifty <i>shekels,</i>
c9468	And of cassia five hundred <i>shekels,</i> after the shekel of the sanctuary, and of oil olive an hin:
c9469	And thou shalt make it an oil of holy ointment, an ointment compound after the art of the apothecary:
c9470	it shall be an holy anointing oil.
c9471	And thou shalt anoint the tabernacle of the congregation therewith, and the ark of the testimony,
c9472	And the table and all his vessels, and the candlestick and his vessels, and the altar of incense,
c9473	And the altar of burnt offering with all his vessels, and the laver and his foot.
c9474	And thou shalt sanctify
c9475	them, that they may be most holy:
c9476	whatsoever
c9477	toucheth
c9478	them shall be holy.
c9479	And thou shalt anoint Aaron and his sons,
c9480	and consecrate
c9481	them, that <i>they</i> may minister unto me in the priest's office.
c9482	And thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel,
c9483	saying,
c9484	This shall be an holy anointing oil unto me throughout your generations.
c9485	Upon man's flesh shall it not be poured,
c9486	neither shall ye make <i>any other</i> like it, after the composition
c9487	of it: it <i>is</i> holy,
c9488	<i>and</i> it shall be holy unto you.
c9489	Whosoever
c9490	compoundeth <i>any</i> like it,
c9491	or whosoever putteth <i>any</i> of it upon a stranger,
c9492	shall even be cut off from his people.
c9493	And the LORD said unto Moses,
c9494	Take unto thee sweet spices, stacte, and onycha, and galbanum; <i>these</i> sweet spices with pure frankincense:
c9495	of each shall there be a like <i>weight:</i>
c9496	And thou shalt make it a perfume, a confection after the art of the apothecary, tempered together, pure <i>and</i> holy:
c9497	And thou shalt beat <i>some</i> of it very small,
c9498	and put of it before the testimony in the tabernacle of the congregation,
c9499	where I will meet
c9500	with thee: it shall be unto you most holy.
c9501	And <i>as for</i> the perfume
c9502	which thou shalt make,
c9503	ye shall not make to yourselves according to the composition
c9504	thereof: it shall be unto thee holy for the LORD.
c9505	Whosoever
c9506	shall make like unto that,
c9507	to smell
c9508	thereto, shall even be cut off from his people.
c9509	And the LORD spake unto Moses,
c9510	saying,
c9511	See,
c9512	I have called by name Bezaleel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah:
c9513	And I have filled him with the spirit of God, in wisdom, and in understanding, and in knowledge, and in all manner of workmanship,
c9514	To devise cunning works,
c9515	to work in gold, and in silver, and in brass,
c9516	And in cutting of stones,
c9517	to set
c9518	<i>them,</i> and in carving of timber,
c9519	to work in all manner of workmanship.
c9520	And I,
c9521	behold, I have given with him Aholiab, the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan:
c9522	and in the hearts of all that are wise hearted I have put wisdom,
c9523	that they may make all
c9524	that I have commanded thee;
c9525	The tabernacle of the congregation, and the ark of the testimony, and the mercy seat
c9526	that <i>is</i> thereupon,
c9527	and all the furniture of the tabernacle,
c9528	And the table and his furniture, and the pure candlestick with all his furniture, and the altar of incense,
c9529	And the altar of burnt offering with all his furniture, and the laver and his foot,
c9530	And the cloths of service, and the holy garments for Aaron the priest, and the garments of his sons,
c9531	to minister in the priest's office,
c9532	And the anointing oil, and sweet incense for the holy
c9533	<i>place:</i> according to all
c9534	that I have commanded
c9535	thee shall they do.
c9536	And the LORD spake unto Moses,
c9537	saying,
c9538	Speak thou also unto the children of Israel,
c9539	saying,
c9540	Verily my sabbaths ye shall keep:
c9541	for it <i>is</i> a sign between me and you throughout your generations;
c9542	that <i>ye</i> may know
c9543	that I <i>am</i> the LORD that doth sanctify you.
c9544	Ye shall keep the sabbath
c9545	therefore; for it <i>is</i> holy
c9546	unto you: every one that defileth
c9547	it shall surely be put to death:
c9548	for whosoever
c9549	doeth <i>any</i> work
c9550	therein, that soul shall be cut off from among his people.
c9551	Six days may work be done;
c9552	but in the seventh <i>is</i> the sabbath of rest, holy to the LORD:
c9554	whosoever
c9555	doeth <i>any</i> work in the sabbath day,
c9556	he shall surely be put to death.
c9557	Wherefore the children of Israel shall keep the sabbath,
c9558	to observe the sabbath throughout their generations, <i>for</i> a perpetual covenant.
c9559	It <i>is</i> a sign between me and the children of Israel for ever:
c9560	for <i>in</i> six days the LORD made heaven and earth,
c9561	and on the seventh day he rested,
c9562	and was refreshed.
c9563	And he gave unto Moses,
c9564	when he had made an end
c9565	of communing with him upon mount Sinai,
c9566	two tables of testimony, tables of stone,
c9567	written with the finger of God.
c9568	And when the people saw
c9569	that Moses delayed
c9570	to come down out of the mount,
c9571	the people gathered themselves together unto Aaron,
c9572	and said unto
c9573	him, Up,
c9574	make us gods,
c9575	which shall go before
c9576	us; for <i>as for</i> this Moses, the man
c9577	that brought us up out of the land of Egypt,
c9578	we wot not
c9579	what is become of him.
c9580	And Aaron said unto
c9581	them, Break off the golden earrings,
c9582	which <i>are</i> in the ears of your wives, of your sons, and of your daughters,
c9583	and bring <i>them</i> unto me.
c9584	And all the people brake off the golden earrings
c9585	which <i>were</i> in their ears,
c9586	and brought <i>them</i> unto Aaron.
c9587	And he received <i>them</i> at their hand,
c9588	and fashioned it with a graving tool,
c9589	after he had made it a molten calf:
c9590	and they said,
c9591	These <i>be</i> thy gods,
c9592	O Israel,
c9593	which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt.
c9594	And when Aaron saw
c9595	<i>it,</i> he built an altar before
c9596	it; and Aaron made proclamation,
c9597	and said,
c9598	To morrow <i>is</i> a feast to the LORD.
c9599	And they rose up early on the morrow,
c9600	and offered burnt offerings,
c9601	and brought peace offerings;
c9602	and the people sat down
c9603	to eat
c9604	and to drink,
c9605	and rose up
c9606	to play.
c9607	And the LORD said unto Moses,
c9608	Go,
c9609	get thee down;
c9610	for thy people, which thou broughtest out of the land of Egypt, have corrupted <i>themselves:</i>
c9612	They have turned aside quickly out of the way
c9613	which I commanded
c9614	them: they have made them a molten calf,
c9615	and have worshipped
c9616	it, and have sacrificed
c9617	thereunto, and said,
c9618	These <i>be</i> thy gods,
c9619	O Israel,
c9620	which have brought thee up out of the land of Egypt.
c9621	And the LORD said unto Moses,
c9622	I have seen this people,
c9623	and, behold,
c9624	it <i>is</i> a stiffnecked people:
c9625	Now
c9626	therefore let me alone,
c9627	that my wrath may wax hot
c9628	against them, and that I may consume
c9629	them: and I will make of thee a great nation.
c9630	And Moses besought the LORD his God,
c9631	and said,
c9632	why
c9633	LORD,
c9634	doth thy wrath wax hot against thy people,
c9635	which thou hast brought forth out of the land of Egypt with great power, and with a mighty hand?
c9636	Wherefore should the Egyptians speak,
c9637	and say,
c9638	For mischief did he bring them out,
c9639	to slay them in the mountains,
c9640	and to consume them from the face of the earth?
c9641	Turn from thy fierce wrath,
c9642	and repent of this evil against thy people.
c9643	Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, thy servants,
c9644	to whom thou swarest
c9645	by thine own self, and saidst unto
c9646	them, I will multiply your seed as the stars of heaven,
c9647	and all this land
c9648	that I have spoken
c9649	of will I give unto your seed,
c9650	and they shall inherit <i>it</i> for ever.
c9651	And the LORD repented of the evil
c9652	which he thought
c9653	to do unto his people.
c9655	And Moses turned, and went down from the mount,
c9656	and the two tables of the testimony <i>were</i> in his hand: the tables
c9657	<i>were</i> written on both their sides;
c9658	on the one side and on the other <i>were</i> they written.
c9659	And the tables
c9660	<i>were</i> the work of God,
c9661	and the writing
c9662	<i>was</i> the writing of God,
c9663	graven upon the tables.
c9664	And when Joshua heard the noise of the people as they shouted,
c9665	he said unto Moses,
c9666	<i>There is</i> a noise of war in the camp.
c9667	And he said,
c9668	<i>It is</i> not the voice of <i>them that</i> shout for mastery,
c9669	neither <i>is it</i> the voice of <i>them that</i> cry for being overcome:
c9670	<i>but</i> the noise of <i>them that</i> sing do I hear.
c9671	And it came to pass,
c9672	as soon as he came nigh unto the camp,
c9673	that he saw the calf, and the dancing:
c9674	and Moses' anger waxed hot,
c9675	and he cast the tables out of his hands,
c9676	and brake them beneath the mount.
c9677	And he took the calf
c9678	which they had made,
c9679	and burnt <i>it</i> in the fire,
c9680	and ground
c9681	<i>it</i> to powder,
c9682	and strawed <i>it</i> upon the water,
c9683	and made the children of Israel drink <i>of it.</i>
c9684	And Moses said unto Aaron,
c9685	What did this people
c9686	unto thee, that thou hast brought so great a sin upon them?
c9687	And Aaron said,
c9688	Let not the anger of my lord wax hot:
c9689	thou knowest the people,
c9690	that they <i>are set</i> on mischief.
c9691	For they said
c9692	unto me, Make us gods,
c9693	which shall go before
c9694	us: for <i>as for</i> this Moses, the man
c9695	that brought us up out of the land of Egypt,
c9696	we wot not
c9697	what is become of him.
c9698	And I said
c9699	unto them, Whosoever hath any gold,
c9700	let them break <i>it</i> off.
c9701	So they gave
c9702	<i>it</i> me: then I cast it into the fire,
c9703	and there came out this calf.
c9704	And when Moses saw that the people
c9705	<i>were</i> naked;
c9706	(for Aaron had made them naked unto <i>their</i> shame among their enemies:)
c9707	Then Moses stood in the gate of the camp,
c9708	and said,
c9709	Who <i>is</i> on the LORD'S
c9710	side? <i>let him come</i> unto
c9711	me. And all the sons of Levi gathered themselves together unto him.
c9712	And he said
c9713	unto them, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel,
c9714	Put
c9715	every man his sword by his side,
c9716	<i>and</i> go in
c9717	and out from gate to gate throughout the camp,
c9718	and slay
c9719	every man his brother,
c9720	and every man his companion,
c9721	and every man his neighbour.
c9722	And the children of Levi did according to the word of Moses:
c9723	and there fell of the people that day about three thousand men.
c9724	For Moses had said,
c9725	Consecrate yourselves to day to the LORD,
c9726	even every man upon his son, and upon his brother;
c9727	that he may bestow upon you a blessing this day.
c9728	And it came to pass on the morrow,
c9729	that Moses said unto the people,
c9730	Ye have sinned a great sin:
c9731	and now
c9732	I will go up unto the LORD;
c9733	peradventure I shall make an atonement for your sin.
c9734	And Moses returned unto the LORD,
c9735	and said,
c9736	Oh, this people have sinned a great sin,
c9737	and have made them gods of gold.
c9738	Yet now,
c9739	if thou wilt forgive their sin--;
c9740	and if not,
c9741	blot me, I pray thee, out of thy book
c9742	which thou hast written.
c9743	And the LORD said unto Moses,
c9744	Whosoever
c9745	hath sinned
c9746	against me, him will I blot out of my book.
c9747	Therefore now
c9748	go,
c9749	lead the people
c9750	unto <i>the place</i> of which I have spoken
c9751	unto thee: behold,
c9752	mine Angel shall go before
c9753	thee: nevertheless in the day when I visit
c9754	I will visit their sin upon them.
c9755	And the LORD plagued the people,
c9756	because they made the calf,
c9757	which Aaron made.
c9758	And the LORD said unto Moses,
c9759	Depart,
c9760	<i>and</i> go up hence, thou and the people
c9761	which thou hast brought up out of the land of Egypt,
c9762	unto the land
c9763	which I sware unto Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob,
c9764	saying,
c9765	Unto thy seed will I give it:
c9766	And I will send an angel before
c9767	thee; and I will drive out the Canaanite, the Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite:
c9768	Unto a land flowing with milk and honey:
c9769	for I will not go up in the midst
c9770	of thee; for thou <i>art</i> a stiffnecked people:
c9771	lest I consume thee in the way.
c9772	And when the people heard these evil tidings,
c9773	they mourned:
c9774	and no man did put
c9775	on him his ornaments.
c9776	For the LORD had said unto Moses,
c9777	Say unto the children of Israel,
c9778	Ye <i>are</i> a stiffnecked people:
c9779	I will come up into the midst of thee in a moment,
c9780	and consume
c9781	thee: therefore now
c9782	put off thy ornaments from
c9783	thee, that I may know
c9784	what to do unto thee.
c9785	And the children of Israel stripped themselves of their ornaments by the mount Horeb.
c9786	And Moses took the tabernacle,
c9787	and pitched it without the camp,
c9788	afar off from the camp,
c9789	and called it the Tabernacle of the congregation.
c9790	And it came to pass,
c9791	<i>that</i> every one
c9792	which sought the LORD
c9793	went out unto the tabernacle of the congregation,
c9794	which <i>was</i> without the camp.
c9795	And it came to pass,
c9796	when Moses went out unto the tabernacle,
c9797	<i>that</i> all the people rose up,
c9798	and stood
c9799	every man <i>at</i> his tent door,
c9800	and looked after Moses,
c9801	until he was gone into the tabernacle.
c9802	And it came to pass,
c9803	as Moses entered into the tabernacle,
c9804	the cloudy pillar descended,
c9805	and stood <i>at</i> the door of the tabernacle,
c9806	and <i>the LORD</i> talked with Moses.
c9807	And all the people saw the cloudy pillar
c9808	stand <i>at</i> the tabernacle door:
c9809	and all the people rose up
c9810	and worshipped,
c9811	every man <i>in</i> his tent door.
c9812	And the LORD spake unto Moses face to face,
c9813	as a man speaketh unto his friend.
c9814	And he turned again into the camp:
c9815	but his servant Joshua, the son of Nun, a young man, departed not out of the tabernacle.
c9816	And Moses said unto the LORD,
c9817	See,
c9818	thou sayest unto
c9819	me, Bring up this people:
c9820	and thou hast not let me know
c9821	whom thou wilt send with
c9822	me. Yet thou hast said,
c9823	I know thee by name,
c9824	and thou hast also found grace in my sight.
c9825	Now
c9826	therefore, I pray thee, if I have found grace in thy sight,
c9827	shew me now thy way,
c9829	that I may know thee, that I may find grace in thy sight:
c9830	and consider
c9831	that this nation <i>is</i> thy people.
c9832	And he said,
c9833	My presence shall go
c9834	<i>with thee,</i> and I will give thee rest.
c9835	And he said unto
c9836	him, If thy presence go not
c9837	<i>with me,</i> carry us not up hence.
c9838	For wherein shall it be known here
c9839	that I and thy people have found grace in thy sight?
c9840	<i>is it</i> not
c9841	in that thou goest with
c9842	us? so shall we be separated, I and thy people, from all the people
c9843	that <i>are</i> upon the face of the earth.
c9844	And the LORD said unto Moses,
c9845	this thing also
c9846	that thou hast spoken:
c9847	I will do
c9848	for thou hast found grace in my sight,
c9849	and I know thee by name.
c9850	And he said,
c9851	I beseech thee, shew me thy glory.
c9852	And he said,
c9853	I will make all my goodness pass before
c9854	thee, and I will proclaim the name of the LORD before
c9855	thee; and will be gracious
c9856	to whom I will be gracious,
c9857	and will shew mercy
c9858	on whom I will shew mercy.
c9859	And he said,
c9860	Thou canst not
c9861	see my face:
c9862	for there shall no man see
c9863	me, and live.
c9864	And the LORD said,
c9865	Behold, <i>there is</i> a place by
c9866	me, and thou shalt stand upon a rock:
c9867	And it shall come to pass,
c9868	while my glory passeth by,
c9869	that I will put thee in a clift of the rock,
c9870	and will cover thee with my hand
c9871	while I pass by:
c9872	And I will take away mine hand,
c9873	and thou shalt see my back parts:
c9874	but my face shall not be seen.
c9875	And the LORD said unto Moses,
c9876	Hew thee two tables of stone like unto the first:
c9877	and I will write upon <i>these</i> tables the words
c9878	that were in the first tables,
c9879	which thou brakest.
c9880	And be ready in the morning,
c9881	and come up in the morning unto mount Sinai,
c9882	and present thyself there to me in the top of the mount.
c9883	And no man shall come up with
c9884	thee, neither let any man be seen throughout all the mount;
c9885	neither let the flocks nor herds feed before that mount.
c9886	And he hewed two tables of stone like unto the first;
c9887	and Moses rose up early in the morning,
c9888	and went up unto mount Sinai,
c9889	as the LORD had commanded
c9890	him, and took in his hand the two tables of stone.
c9891	And the LORD descended in the cloud,
c9892	and stood with him there,
c9893	and proclaimed the name of the LORD.
c9894	And the LORD passed by before
c9895	him, and proclaimed,
c9896	The LORD, The LORD
c9897	God, merciful and gracious,
c9898	longsuffering, and abundant in goodness and truth,
c9899	Keeping mercy for thousands,
c9900	forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin,
c9901	and that will by no means clear
c9902	<i>the guilty;</i> visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children, and upon the children's children, unto the third and to the fourth <i>generation.</i>
c9903	And Moses made haste,
c9904	and bowed his head toward the earth,
c9905	and worshipped.
c9906	And he said,
c9907	If now I have found grace in thy sight,
c9908	O Lord,
c9909	let my Lord, I pray thee, go among
c9910	us; for it <i>is</i> a stiffnecked people;
c9911	and pardon our iniquity and our sin,
c9912	and take us for thine inheritance.
c9913	And he said,
c9914	Behold, I make a covenant:
c9915	before all thy people I will do marvels,
c9916	such as have not been done in all the earth, nor in any nation:
c9917	and all the people among which thou <i>art</i> shall see
c9919	the work of the LORD:
c9920	for it <i>is</i> a terrible thing
c9921	that I will do with thee.
c9922	Observe
c9923	thou that which I command thee this day:
c9924	behold, I drive out before thee the Amorite, and the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite.
c9925	Take heed
c9926	to thyself, lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land
c9927	whither thou goest,
c9928	lest it be for a snare in the midst of thee:
c9929	But ye shall destroy their altars,
c9930	break their images,
c9931	and cut down their groves:
c9932	For thou shalt worship no other god:
c9933	for the LORD,
c9934	whose name <i>is</i> Jealous,
c9935	<i>is</i> a jealous God:
c9936	Lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land,
c9937	and they go a whoring after their gods,
c9938	and do sacrifice unto their gods,
c9939	and <i>one</i> call
c9940	thee, and thou eat of his sacrifice;
c9941	And thou take of their daughters unto thy sons,
c9942	and their daughters go a whoring after their gods,
c9943	and make thy sons go a whoring after their gods.
c9944	Thou shalt make thee no molten gods.
c9945	The feast of unleavened bread shalt thou keep.
c9946	Seven days thou shalt eat unleavened bread,
c9947	as I commanded thee, in the time of the month Abib:
c9948	for in the month Abib thou camest out from Egypt.
c9949	All that openeth the matrix
c9950	<i>is</i> mine; and every firstling among thy cattle,
c9951	<i>whether</i> ox or sheep, <i>that is male.</i>
c9952	But the firstling of an ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb:
c9953	and if thou redeem <i>him</i> not,
c9954	then shalt thou break his neck.
c9955	All the firstborn of thy sons thou shalt redeem.
c9956	And none shall appear before me empty.
c9957	Six days thou shalt work,
c9958	but on the seventh day thou shalt rest:
c9959	in earing time and in harvest thou shalt rest.
c9960	And thou shalt observe the feast of weeks, of the firstfruits of wheat harvest,
c9961	and the feast of ingathering at the year's end.
c9962	Thrice in the year shall all your men children appear before the Lord GOD, the God of Israel.
c9963	For I will cast out the nations before
c9964	thee, and enlarge thy borders:
c9965	neither shall any man desire thy land,
c9966	when thou shalt go up
c9967	to appear before the LORD thy God
c9968	thrice in the year.
c9969	Thou shalt not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leaven;
c9970	neither shall the sacrifice of the feast of the passover be left unto the morning.
c9971	The first of the firstfruits of thy land thou shalt bring unto the house of the LORD thy God.
c9972	Thou shalt not seethe a kid in his mother's milk.
c9973	And the LORD said unto Moses,
c9974	Write thou these words:
c9975	for after the tenor of these words I have made a covenant with thee and with Israel.
c9976	And he was there with the LORD forty days and forty nights;
c9977	he did neither eat bread,
c9978	nor drink water.
c9979	And he wrote upon the tables the words of the covenant, the ten commandments.
c9980	And it came to pass,
c9981	when Moses came down from mount Sinai
c9982	with the two tables of testimony in Moses' hand,
c9983	when he came down from the mount,
c9984	that Moses wist not
c9985	that the skin of his face shone
c9986	while he talked with him.
c9987	And when Aaron and all the children of Israel saw Moses,
c9988	behold, the skin of his face shone;
c9989	and they were afraid
c9990	to come nigh him.
c9991	And Moses called unto
c9992	them; and Aaron and all the rulers of the congregation returned unto
c9993	him: and Moses talked with them.
c9994	And afterward all the children of Israel came nigh:
c9995	and he gave them in commandment all
c9996	that the LORD had spoken with him in mount Sinai.
c9997	And <i>till</i> Moses had done
c9998	speaking with
c9999	them, he put a vail on his face.
c10001	But when Moses went in before the LORD
c10002	to speak with
c10003	him, he took the vail off,
c10004	until he came out.
c10005	And he came out,
c10006	and spake unto the children of Israel
c10007	<i>that</i> which he was commanded.
c10008	And the children of Israel saw the face of Moses,
c10009	that the skin of Moses' face shone:
c10010	and Moses put the vail upon his face
c10011	again, until he went in
c10012	to speak with him.
c10013	And Moses gathered all the congregation of the children of Israel
c10014	together, and said unto
c10015	them, These <i>are</i> the words
c10016	which the LORD hath commanded,
c10017	that <i>ye</i> should do them.
c10018	Six days shall work be done,
c10019	but on the seventh day there shall be to you an holy
c10020	day, a sabbath of rest to the LORD:
c10021	whosoever
c10022	doeth work
c10023	therein shall be put to death.
c10024	Ye shall kindle no fire throughout your habitations upon the sabbath day.
c10025	And Moses spake unto all the congregation of the children of Israel,
c10026	saying,
c10027	This <i>is</i> the thing
c10028	which the LORD commanded,
c10029	saying,
c10030	Take ye from among you an offering unto the LORD: whosoever <i>is</i> of a willing heart, let him bring it,
c10031	an offering of the LORD; gold, and silver, and brass,
c10032	And blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine linen, and goats' <i>hair,</i>
c10033	And rams' skins dyed red, and badgers' skins, and shittim wood,
c10034	And oil for the light, and spices for anointing oil, and for the sweet incense,
c10035	And onyx stones, and stones to be set for the ephod, and for the breastplate.
c10036	And every wise hearted among you shall come,
c10037	and make all
c10038	that the LORD hath commanded;
c10039	The tabernacle, his tent, and his covering, his taches, and his boards, his bars, his pillars, and his sockets,
c10040	The ark, and the staves thereof, <i>with</i> the mercy seat, and the vail of the covering,
c10041	The table, and his staves, and all his vessels, and the shewbread,
c10042	The candlestick also for the light, and his furniture, and his lamps, with the oil for the light,
c10043	And the incense altar, and his staves, and the anointing oil, and the sweet incense, and the hanging for the door at the entering in of the tabernacle,
c10044	The altar of burnt offering, with his brasen grate,
c10046	his staves, and all his vessels, the laver and his foot,
c10047	The hangings of the court, his pillars, and their sockets, and the hanging for the door of the court,
c10048	The pins of the tabernacle, and the pins of the court, and their cords,
c10049	The cloths of service,
c10050	to do service in the holy
c10051	<i>place,</i> the holy garments for Aaron the priest, and the garments of his sons,
c10052	to minister in the priest's office.
c10053	And all the congregation of the children of Israel departed from the presence of Moses.
c10054	And they came, every one
c10055	whose heart stirred him up,
c10056	and every one
c10057	whom his spirit made willing,
c10058	<i>and</i> they brought the LORD'S offering to the work of the tabernacle of the congregation, and for all his service, and for the holy garments.
c10059	And they came, both men and women, as many as were willing hearted, <i>and</i> brought bracelets, and earrings, and rings, and tablets, all jewels of gold:
c10061	and every man
c10062	that offered <i>offered</i> an offering of gold unto the LORD.
c10063	And every man,
c10064	with whom was found blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine linen, and goats' <i>hair,</i> and red skins of rams, and badgers' skins,
c10065	brought <i>them.</i>
c10066	Every one
c10067	that did offer an offering of silver and brass
c10068	brought the LORD'S offering:
c10069	and every man,
c10070	with whom was found shittim wood for any work of the service,
c10071	brought <i>it.</i>
c10072	And all the women that were wise hearted
c10073	did spin with their hands,
c10074	and brought that which they had spun, <i>both</i> of blue, and of purple, <i>and</i> of scarlet, and of fine linen.
c10075	And all the women
c10076	whose heart stirred them up in wisdom
c10077	spun goats' <i>hair.</i>
c10078	And the rulers brought onyx stones, and stones to be set, for the ephod, and for the breastplate;
c10079	And spice, and oil for the light, and for the anointing oil, and for the sweet incense.
c10081	whose heart made them willing to bring
c10082	for all manner of work,
c10083	which the LORD had commanded
c10084	to be made by the hand of Moses.
c10085	The children of Israel brought a willing offering unto the LORD, every man and woman,
c10086	And Moses said unto the children of Israel,
c10087	See,
c10088	the LORD hath called by name Bezaleel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah;
c10089	And he hath filled him with the spirit of God, in wisdom, in understanding, and in knowledge, and in all manner of workmanship;
c10090	And to devise curious works,
c10091	to work in gold, and in silver, and in brass,
c10092	And in the cutting of stones,
c10093	to set
c10094	<i>them,</i> and in carving of wood,
c10095	to make any manner of cunning work.
c10098	And he hath put in his heart that he may teach, <i>both</i> he, and Aholiab, the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan.
c10099	Them hath he filled with wisdom of heart,
c10100	to work all manner of work, of the engraver, and of the cunning workman, and of the embroiderer, in blue, and in purple, in scarlet, and in fine linen, and of the weaver,
c10101	<i>even</i> of them that do any work, and of those that devise cunning work.
c10102	Then wrought Bezaleel and Aholiab, and every wise hearted man,
c10103	in whom the LORD put wisdom and understanding
c10104	to know
c10105	how to work all manner of work for the service of the sanctuary, according to all
c10106	that the LORD had commanded.
c10107	And Moses called Bezaleel and Aholiab, and every wise hearted man, in whose heart the LORD had put wisdom,
c10109	<i>even</i> every one
c10110	whose heart stirred him up
c10111	to come unto the work
c10112	to do it:
c10113	And they received of Moses all the offering,
c10114	which the children of Israel had brought for the work of the service of the sanctuary,
c10115	to make
c10116	it <i>withal.</i> And they brought yet unto him free offerings every morning.
c10117	And all the wise men, that wrought all the work of the sanctuary, came
c10119	every man from his work
c10120	which they made;
c10121	And they spake unto Moses,
c10122	saying,
c10123	The people bring much more
c10124	than enough for the service of the work,
c10125	which the LORD commanded
c10126	to make.
c10127	And Moses gave commandment,
c10128	and they caused it to be proclaimed throughout the camp,
c10129	saying,
c10130	Let neither man nor woman make any more work for the offering of the sanctuary.
c10131	So the people were restrained
c10132	from bringing.
c10133	For the stuff they had was sufficient for all the work
c10134	to make
c10135	it, and too much.
c10136	And every wise hearted man among them that wrought the work of the tabernacle made ten curtains <i>of</i> fine twined linen, and blue, and purple, and scarlet:
c10137	<i>with</i> cherubims of cunning work made he them.
c10138	The length of one curtain <i>was</i> twenty and eight cubits,
c10139	and the breadth of one curtain four cubits:
c10140	the curtains <i>were</i> all of one size.
c10141	And he coupled the five curtains
c10142	one unto another:
c10143	and <i>the other</i> five curtains he coupled one
c10144	unto another.
c10145	And he made loops of blue on the edge of one curtain from the selvedge in the coupling:
c10146	likewise he made in the uttermost side of <i>another</i> curtain, in the coupling of the second.
c10147	Fifty loops made he in one curtain,
c10148	and fifty loops made he in the edge of the curtain
c10149	which <i>was</i> in the coupling of the second:
c10150	the loops held one <i>curtain</i> to another.
c10151	And he made fifty taches of gold,
c10152	and coupled the curtains
c10153	one unto another
c10154	with the taches:
c10155	so it became one tabernacle.
c10156	And he made curtains <i>of</i> goats' <i>hair</i> for the tent over the tabernacle:
c10157	eleven curtains he made them.
c10158	The length of one curtain <i>was</i> thirty cubits,
c10159	and four cubits <i>was</i> the breadth of one curtain:
c10160	the eleven curtains <i>were</i> of one size.
c10161	And he coupled five curtains by themselves,
c10162	and six curtains by themselves.
c10163	And he made fifty loops upon the uttermost edge of the curtain in the coupling,
c10164	and fifty loops made he upon the edge of the curtain which coupleth the second.
c10165	And he made fifty taches <i>of</i> brass
c10166	to couple the tent together,
c10167	that it might be one.
c10168	And he made a covering for the tent <i>of</i> rams' skins dyed red,
c10169	and a covering <i>of</i> badgers' skins above <i>that.</i>
c10170	And he made boards for the tabernacle <i>of</i> shittim wood,
c10171	standing up.
c10172	The length of a board <i>was</i> ten cubits,
c10173	and the breadth of a board one cubit and a half.
c10174	One board had two tenons,
c10175	equally distant one from another:
c10176	thus did he make for all the boards of the tabernacle.
c10177	And he made boards for the tabernacle;
c10178	twenty boards for the south side southward:
c10179	And forty sockets of silver he made under the twenty boards;
c10180	two sockets under one board for his two tenons,
c10181	and two sockets under another board for his two tenons.
c10182	And for the other side of the tabernacle, <i>which is</i> toward the north corner, he made twenty boards,
c10183	And their forty sockets of silver;
c10184	two sockets under one board,
c10185	and two sockets under another board.
c10186	And for the sides of the tabernacle westward he made six boards.
c10187	And two boards made he for the corners of the tabernacle in the two sides.
c10188	And they were coupled beneath,
c10189	and coupled together at the head thereof, to one ring:
c10190	thus he did to both of them in both the corners.
c10191	And there were eight boards; and their sockets <i>were</i> sixteen sockets of silver,
c10192	under every board two sockets.
c10193	And he made bars of shittim wood; five for the boards of the one side of the tabernacle,
c10194	And five bars for the boards of the other side of the tabernacle,
c10195	and five bars for the boards of the tabernacle for the sides westward.
c10196	And he made the middle bar
c10197	to shoot through the boards from the one end to the other.
c10198	And he overlaid the boards with gold,
c10199	and made their rings <i>of</i> gold
c10200	<i>to be</i> places for the bars,
c10201	and overlaid the bars with gold.
c10202	And he made a vail <i>of</i> blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen:
c10203	<i>with</i> cherubims made he it of cunning work.
c10204	And he made thereunto four pillars <i>of</i> shittim
c10205	<i>wood,</i> and overlaid them with gold:
c10206	their hooks <i>were of</i> gold;
c10207	and he cast for them four sockets of silver.
c10208	And he made an hanging for the tabernacle door <i>of</i> blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen,
c10209	of needlework;
c10210	And the five pillars of it with their hooks:
c10211	and he overlaid their chapiters and their fillets with gold:
c10212	but their five sockets <i>were of</i> brass.
c10213	And Bezaleel made the ark <i>of</i> shittim wood:
c10214	two cubits and a half <i>was</i> the length
c10215	of it, and a cubit and a half the breadth
c10216	of it, and a cubit and a half the height of it:
c10217	And he overlaid it with pure gold within and without,
c10218	and made a crown of gold to it round about.
c10219	And he cast for it four rings of gold, <i>to be set</i> by the four corners
c10220	of it; even two rings upon the one side
c10221	of it, and two rings upon the other side of it.
c10222	And he made staves <i>of</i> shittim wood,
c10223	and overlaid them with gold.
c10224	And he put the staves into the rings by the sides of the ark,
c10225	to bear the ark.
c10226	And he made the mercy seat <i>of</i> pure gold:
c10227	two cubits and a half <i>was</i> the length
c10228	thereof, and one cubit and a half the breadth thereof.
c10229	And he made two cherubims <i>of</i> gold,
c10230	beaten out of one piece made he them, on the two ends of the mercy seat;
c10231	One cherub on the end on this side,
c10232	and another cherub on the <i>other</i> end on that side:
c10233	out of the mercy seat made he the cherubims on the two ends thereof.
c10234	And the cherubims spread out <i>their</i> wings on high, <i>and</i> covered with their wings over the mercy seat,
c10236	with their faces one to another;
c10237	<i>even</i> to the mercy seatward were the faces of the cherubims.
c10238	And he made the table <i>of</i> shittim wood:
c10239	two cubits <i>was</i> the length
c10240	thereof, and a cubit the breadth
c10241	thereof, and a cubit and a half the height thereof:
c10242	And he overlaid it with pure gold,
c10243	and made thereunto a crown of gold round about.
c10244	Also he made thereunto a border of an handbreadth round about;
c10245	and made a crown of gold for the border thereof round about.
c10246	And he cast for it four rings of gold,
c10247	and put the rings upon the four corners
c10248	that <i>were</i> in the four feet thereof.
c10249	Over against the border were the rings, the places for the staves
c10250	to bear the table.
c10251	And he made the staves <i>of</i> shittim wood,
c10252	and overlaid them with gold,
c10253	to bear the table.
c10254	And he made the vessels
c10255	which <i>were</i> upon the table,
c10256	his dishes, and his spoons, and his bowls, and his covers
c10257	to cover withal,
c10258	<i>of</i> pure gold.
c10259	And he made the candlestick <i>of</i> pure gold:
c10260	<i>of</i> beaten work made he the candlestick;
c10261	his shaft, and his branch, his bowls, his knops, and his flowers, were of the same:
c10262	And six branches going out of the sides
c10263	thereof; three branches of the candlestick out of the one side
c10264	thereof, and three branches of the candlestick out of the other side thereof:
c10265	Three bowls made after the fashion of almonds in one branch,
c10266	a knop and a flower;
c10267	and three bowls made like almonds in another branch,
c10268	a knop and a flower:
c10269	so throughout the six branches
c10270	going out of the candlestick.
c10271	And in the candlestick <i>were</i> four bowls made like almonds,
c10272	his knops, and his flowers:
c10273	And a knop under two branches of
c10274	the same, and a knop under two branches of
c10275	the same, and a knop under two branches of
c10276	the same, according to the six branches
c10277	going out of it.
c10278	Their knops and their branches were of
c10279	the same: all of it <i>was</i> one beaten work <i>of</i> pure gold.
c10280	And he made his seven lamps,
c10281	and his snuffers, and his snuffdishes, <i>of</i> pure gold.
c10282	<i>Of</i> a talent of pure gold made he it, and all the vessels thereof.
c10283	And he made the incense altar <i>of</i> shittim wood:
c10284	the length of it <i>was</i> a cubit,
c10285	and the breadth of it a cubit;
c10286	<i>it was</i> foursquare;
c10287	and two cubits <i>was</i> the height
c10288	of it; the horns thereof were of the same.
c10289	And he overlaid it with pure gold, <i>both</i> the top of it, and the sides thereof round about, and the horns
c10290	of it: also he made unto it a crown of gold round about.
c10291	And he made two rings of gold for it under the crown thereof, by the two corners of it, upon the two sides
c10292	thereof, to be places for the staves
c10293	to bear it withal.
c10294	And he made the staves <i>of</i> shittim wood,
c10295	and overlaid them with gold.
c10296	And he made the holy anointing oil,
c10297	and the pure incense of sweet spices, according to the work of the apothecary.
c10298	And he made the altar of burnt offering <i>of</i> shittim wood:
c10299	five cubits <i>was</i> the length
c10300	thereof, and five cubits the breadth
c10301	thereof; <i>it was</i> foursquare;
c10302	and three cubits the height thereof.
c10303	And he made the horns thereof on the four corners
c10304	of it; the horns thereof were of
c10305	the same: and he overlaid it with brass.
c10306	And he made all the vessels of the altar, the pots, and the shovels, and the basons, <i>and</i> the fleshhooks, and the firepans:
c10307	all the vessels thereof made he <i>of</i> brass.
c10308	And he made for the altar a brasen grate of network under the compass thereof beneath unto the midst of it.
c10309	And he cast four rings for the four ends of the grate of brass,
c10310	<i>to be</i> places for the staves.
c10311	And he made the staves <i>of</i> shittim wood,
c10312	and overlaid them with brass.
c10313	And he put the staves into the rings on the sides of the altar,
c10314	to bear
c10315	it withal; he made the altar hollow with boards.
c10316	And he made the laver <i>of</i> brass,
c10317	and the foot of it <i>of</i> brass,
c10318	of the lookingglasses of <i>the women</i> assembling,
c10319	which assembled <i>at</i> the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.
c10320	And he made the court:
c10321	on the south side southward the hangings of the court <i>were of</i> fine twined linen,
c10322	an hundred cubits:
c10323	Their pillars <i>were</i> twenty, and their brasen sockets twenty;
c10324	the hooks of the pillars and their fillets <i>were of</i> silver.
c10325	And for the north side
c10326	<i>the hangings were</i> an hundred cubits,
c10327	their pillars <i>were</i> twenty, and their sockets of brass twenty;
c10328	the hooks of the pillars and their fillets <i>of</i> silver.
c10329	And for the west side
c10330	<i>were</i> hangings
c10331	of fifty cubits,
c10332	their pillars ten,
c10333	and their sockets ten;
c10334	the hooks of the pillars and their fillets <i>of</i> silver.
c10335	And for the east side eastward
c10336	fifty cubits.
c10337	The hangings of the one side <i>of the gate were</i> fifteen cubits;
c10338	their pillars three,
c10339	and their sockets three.
c10340	And for the other side of the court gate, on this hand and that hand, <i>were</i> hangings
c10341	of fifteen cubits;
c10342	their pillars three,
c10343	and their sockets three.
c10344	All the hangings of the court round about <i>were</i> of fine twined linen.
c10345	And the sockets for the pillars <i>were of</i> brass;
c10346	the hooks of the pillars and their fillets <i>of</i> silver;
c10347	and the overlaying of their chapiters <i>of</i> silver;
c10348	and all the pillars of the court <i>were</i> filleted with silver.
c10349	And the hanging for the gate of the court <i>was</i> needlework, <i>of</i> blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen:
c10350	and twenty cubits <i>was</i> the length,
c10351	and the height in the breadth <i>was</i> five cubits, answerable to the hangings of the court.
c10352	And their pillars <i>were</i> four, and their sockets <i>of</i> brass four;
c10353	their hooks <i>of</i> silver,
c10354	and the overlaying of their chapiters and their fillets <i>of</i> silver.
c10355	And all the pins of the tabernacle, and of the court round about, <i>were of</i> brass.
c10356	This is the sum of the tabernacle, <i>even</i> of the tabernacle of testimony,
c10357	as it was counted, according to the commandment of Moses, <i>for</i> the service of the Levites, by the hand of Ithamar, son to Aaron the priest.
c10358	And Bezaleel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah, made all
c10359	that the LORD commanded Moses.
c10360	And with him <i>was</i> Aholiab, son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan, an engraver, and a cunning workman, and an embroiderer in blue, and in purple, and in scarlet, and fine linen.
c10361	All the gold
c10362	that was occupied for the work in all the work of the holy
c10363	<i>place,</i> even the gold of the offering, was twenty and nine talents, and seven hundred and thirty shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary.
c10364	And the silver of them that were numbered of the congregation <i>was</i> an hundred talents, and a thousand seven hundred and threescore and fifteen shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary:
c10365	A bekah for every man,
c10366	<i>that is,</i> half a shekel, after the shekel of the sanctuary,
c10367	for every one
c10368	that went to be numbered, from twenty years old and upward,
c10369	for six hundred thousand and three thousand and five hundred and fifty <i>men.</i>
c10370	And of the hundred talents of silver were
c10371	cast the sockets of the sanctuary, and the sockets of the vail;
c10372	an hundred sockets of the hundred talents,
c10373	a talent for a socket.
c10374	And of the thousand seven hundred seventy and five shekels he made hooks for the pillars,
c10375	and overlaid their chapiters,
c10376	and filleted them.
c10377	And the brass of the offering <i>was</i> seventy talents, and two thousand and four hundred shekels.
c10378	And therewith he made the sockets to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and the brasen altar, and the brasen grate
c10380	for it, and all the vessels of the altar,
c10381	And the sockets of the court round about, and the sockets of the court gate, and all the pins of the tabernacle, and all the pins of the court round about.
c10382	And of the blue, and purple, and scarlet, they made cloths of service,
c10383	to do service in the holy
c10384	<i>place,</i> and made the holy garments
c10385	for Aaron; as
c10386	the LORD commanded Moses.
c10387	And he made the ephod <i>of</i> gold, blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen.
c10388	And they did beat the gold into thin plates,
c10389	and cut <i>it into</i> wires,
c10390	to work <i>it</i> in the blue, and in the purple, and in the scarlet, and in the fine linen,
c10391	<i>with</i> cunning work.
c10392	They made shoulderpieces
c10393	for it, to couple <i>it</i> together:
c10394	by the two edges was it coupled together.
c10395	And the curious girdle of his ephod,
c10396	that <i>was</i> upon
c10397	it, <i>was</i> of the same,
c10398	according to the work
c10399	thereof; <i>of</i> gold, blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen;
c10400	as the LORD commanded Moses.
c10401	And they wrought onyx stones
c10402	inclosed in ouches of gold,
c10403	graven, as signets are graven, with the names of the children of Israel.
c10404	And he put them on the shoulders of the ephod,
c10405	<i>that they should be</i> stones for a memorial to the children of Israel;
c10406	as the LORD commanded Moses.
c10407	And he made the breastplate <i>of</i> cunning work,
c10408	like the work of the ephod; <i>of</i> gold, blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen.
c10409	It was foursquare;
c10410	they made the breastplate double:
c10411	a span <i>was</i> the length
c10412	thereof, and a span the breadth
c10413	thereof, <i>being</i> doubled.
c10414	And they set in it four rows of stones:
c10415	<i>the first</i> row <i>was</i> a sardius, a topaz, and a carbuncle:
c10416	this <i>was</i> the first row.
c10417	And the second row, an emerald, a sapphire, and a diamond.
c10418	And the third row, a ligure, an agate, and an amethyst.
c10419	And the fourth row, a beryl, an onyx, and a jasper:
c10420	<i>they were</i> inclosed in ouches of gold in their inclosings.
c10421	And the stones
c10422	<i>were</i> according to the names of the children of Israel,
c10423	twelve, according to their names,
c10424	<i>like</i> the engravings of a signet, every one with his name, according to the twelve tribes.
c10425	And they made upon the breastplate chains at the ends, <i>of</i> wreathen work <i>of</i> pure gold.
c10426	And they made two ouches <i>of</i> gold, and two gold rings;
c10427	and put the two rings in the two ends of the breastplate.
c10428	And they put the two wreathen chains of gold in the two rings on the ends of the breastplate.
c10429	And the two ends of the two wreathen chains they fastened in the two ouches,
c10430	and put them on the shoulderpieces of the ephod, before it.
c10431	And they made two rings of gold,
c10432	and put <i>them</i> on the two ends of the breastplate, upon the border
c10433	of it, which <i>was</i> on the side of the ephod inward.
c10434	And they made two <i>other</i> golden rings,
c10435	and put them on the two sides of the ephod underneath, toward the forepart of it, over against the <i>other</i> coupling thereof, above the curious girdle of the ephod.
c10436	And they did bind the breastplate by his rings unto the rings of the ephod with a lace of blue,
c10437	that it might be above the curious girdle of the ephod,
c10438	and that the breastplate might not be loosed from the ephod;
c10439	as the LORD commanded Moses.
c10440	And he made the robe of the ephod <i>of</i> woven work, all <i>of</i> blue.
c10441	And <i>there was</i> an hole in the midst of the robe, as the hole of an habergeon,
c10442	<i>with</i> a band round about the hole,
c10443	that it should not rend.
c10444	And they made upon the hems of the robe pomegranates <i>of</i> blue, and purple, and scarlet,
c10445	<i>and</i> twined <i>linen.</i>
c10446	And they made bells <i>of</i> pure gold,
c10447	and put the bells between the pomegranates upon the hem of the robe, round about between the pomegranates;
c10448	A bell and a pomegranate, a bell and a pomegranate, round about the hem of the robe
c10449	to minister
c10450	<i>in;</i> as the LORD commanded Moses.
c10451	And they made coats <i>of</i> fine linen <i>of</i> woven work for Aaron, and for his sons,
c10452	And a mitre <i>of</i> fine linen,
c10453	and goodly bonnets <i>of</i> fine linen,
c10454	and linen breeches <i>of</i> fine twined linen,
c10455	And a girdle <i>of</i> fine twined linen, and blue, and purple, and scarlet, <i>of</i> needlework;
c10456	as the LORD commanded Moses.
c10457	And they made the plate of the holy crown <i>of</i> pure gold,
c10458	and wrote upon it a writing, <i>like to</i> the engravings of a signet,
c10459	HOLINESS TO THE LORD.
c10460	And they tied unto it a lace of blue,
c10461	to fasten <i>it</i> on high upon the mitre;
c10462	as the LORD commanded Moses.
c10463	Thus was all the work of the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation finished:
c10464	and the children of Israel did according to all
c10465	that the LORD commanded Moses,
c10466	so did they.
c10467	And they brought the tabernacle unto Moses, the tent, and all his furniture, his taches, his boards, his bars, and his pillars, and his sockets,
c10468	And the covering of rams' skins dyed red, and the covering of badgers' skins, and the vail of the covering,
c10469	The ark of the testimony, and the staves thereof, and the mercy seat,
c10470	The table, <i>and</i> all the vessels thereof, and the shewbread,
c10471	The pure candlestick, <i>with</i> the lamps thereof, <i>even with</i> the lamps to be set in order, and all the vessels thereof, and the oil for light,
c10472	And the golden altar, and the anointing oil, and the sweet incense, and the hanging for the tabernacle door,
c10473	The brasen altar, and his grate of brass,
c10475	his staves, and all his vessels, the laver and his foot,
c10476	The hangings of the court, his pillars, and his sockets, and the hanging for the court gate, his cords, and his pins, and all the vessels of the service of the tabernacle, for the tent of the congregation,
c10477	The cloths of service
c10478	to do service in the holy
c10479	<i>place,</i> and the holy garments for Aaron the priest, and his sons' garments,
c10480	to minister in the priest's office.
c10481	According to all
c10482	that the LORD commanded Moses,
c10483	so the children of Israel made all the work.
c10484	And Moses did look upon all the work,
c10485	and, behold,
c10486	they had done
c10487	it as the LORD had commanded,
c10488	even so had they done
c10489	it: and Moses blessed them.
c10490	And the LORD spake unto Moses,
c10491	saying,
c10492	On the first day of the first month shalt thou set up the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation.
c10493	And thou shalt put therein the ark of the testimony,
c10494	and cover the ark with the vail.
c10495	And thou shalt bring in the table,
c10496	and set in order the things that are to be set in order
c10497	upon it; and thou shalt bring in the candlestick,
c10498	and light the lamps thereof.
c10499	And thou shalt set the altar of gold for the incense before the ark of the testimony,
c10500	and put the hanging of the door to the tabernacle.
c10501	And thou shalt set the altar of the burnt offering before the door of the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation.
c10502	And thou shalt set the laver between the tent of the congregation and the altar,
c10503	and shalt put water therein.
c10504	And thou shalt set up the court round about,
c10505	and hang up the hanging at the court gate.
c10506	And thou shalt take the anointing oil,
c10507	and anoint the tabernacle, and all
c10508	that
c10509	<i>is</i> therein, and shalt hallow it, and all the vessels
c10510	thereof: and it shall be holy.
c10511	And thou shalt anoint the altar of the burnt offering, and all his vessels,
c10512	and sanctify the altar:
c10513	and it shall be an altar most holy.
c10514	And thou shalt anoint the laver and his foot,
c10515	and sanctify it.
c10516	And thou shalt bring Aaron and his sons unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation,
c10517	and wash them with water.
c10518	And thou shalt put upon Aaron the holy garments,
c10519	and anoint
c10520	him, and sanctify
c10521	him; that he may minister unto me in the priest's office.
c10522	And thou shalt bring his sons,
c10523	and clothe them with coats:
c10524	And thou shalt anoint
c10525	them, as thou didst anoint their father,
c10526	that they may minister unto me in the priest's office:
c10528	for their anointing shall surely be an everlasting priesthood throughout their generations.
c10529	Thus did Moses:
c10530	according to all
c10531	that the LORD commanded
c10532	him, so did he.
c10533	And it came to pass
c10534	in the first month in the second year, on the first <i>day</i> of the month, <i>that</i> the tabernacle was reared up.
c10535	And Moses reared up the tabernacle,
c10536	and fastened his sockets,
c10537	and set up the boards
c10538	thereof, and put in the bars
c10539	thereof, and reared up his pillars.
c10540	And he spread abroad the tent over the tabernacle,
c10541	and put the covering of the tent above upon
c10542	it; as the LORD commanded Moses.
c10543	And he took
c10544	and put the testimony into the ark,
c10545	and set the staves on the ark,
c10546	and put the mercy seat above upon the ark:
c10547	And he brought the ark into the tabernacle,
c10548	and set up the vail of the covering,
c10549	and covered the ark of the testimony;
c10550	as the LORD commanded Moses.
c10551	And he put the table in the tent of the congregation, upon the side of the tabernacle northward, without the vail.
c10552	And he set the bread in order upon it before the LORD;
c10553	as the LORD had commanded Moses.
c10554	And he put the candlestick in the tent of the congregation, over against the table, on the side of the tabernacle southward.
c10555	And he lighted the lamps before the LORD;
c10556	as the LORD commanded Moses.
c10557	And he put the golden altar in the tent of the congregation before the vail:
c10558	And he burnt sweet incense thereon;
c10559	as the LORD commanded Moses.
c10560	And he set up the hanging <i>at</i> the door of the tabernacle.
c10561	And he put the altar of burnt offering <i>by</i> the door of the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation,
c10562	and offered upon it the burnt offering and the meat offering;
c10563	as the LORD commanded Moses.
c10564	And he set the laver between the tent of the congregation and the altar,
c10565	and put water there,
c10566	to wash <i>withal.</i>
c10567	And Moses and Aaron and his sons washed their hands and their feet thereat:
c10568	When they went into the tent of the congregation,
c10569	and when they came near unto the altar,
c10570	they washed;
c10571	as the LORD commanded Moses.
c10572	And he reared up the court round about the tabernacle and the altar,
c10573	and set up the hanging of the court gate.
c10574	So Moses finished the work.
c10575	Then a cloud covered the tent of the congregation,
c10576	and the glory of the LORD filled the tabernacle.
c10577	And Moses was not able
c10578	to enter into the tent of the congregation,
c10579	because the cloud abode thereon,
c10580	and the glory of the LORD filled the tabernacle.
c10582	And when the cloud was taken up from over the tabernacle,
c10583	the children of Israel went onward in all their journeys:
c10584	But if the cloud were not taken up,
c10585	then they journeyed not till the day
c10586	that it was taken up.
c10587	For the cloud of the LORD <i>was</i> upon the tabernacle by day,
c10588	and fire was on it by night, in the sight of all the house of Israel, throughout all their journeys.
c10590	And the LORD called unto Moses, and spake unto him out of the tabernacle of the congregation,
c10591	saying,
c10592	Speak unto the children of Israel,
c10593	and say unto
c10595	them, If any man of you bring an offering unto the LORD,
c10596	ye shall bring your offering of the cattle, <i>even</i> of the herd, and of the flock.
c10597	If his offering <i>be</i> a burnt sacrifice of the herd,
c10598	a male without blemish:
c10599	let him offer
c10600	he shall offer it of his own voluntary will at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation before the LORD.
c10601	And he shall put his hand upon the head of the burnt offering;
c10602	and it shall be accepted
c10603	for him to make atonement for him.
c10604	And he shall kill the bullock before the LORD:
c10605	and the priests, Aaron's sons, shall bring the blood,
c10606	and sprinkle the blood round about upon the altar
c10607	that <i>is by</i> the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.
c10608	And he shall flay the burnt offering,
c10609	and cut it into his pieces.
c10610	And the sons of Aaron the priest shall put fire upon the altar,
c10611	and lay the wood in order upon the fire:
c10612	And the priests, Aaron's sons, shall lay the parts, the head, and the fat, in order upon the wood
c10613	that <i>is</i> on the fire
c10614	which <i>is</i> upon the altar:
c10615	But his inwards and his legs shall he wash in water:
c10616	and the priest shall burn all on the altar,
c10617	<i>to be</i> a burnt sacrifice,
c10618	an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD.
c10619	And if his offering <i>be</i> of the flocks, <i>namely,</i> of the sheep, or of the goats, for a burnt sacrifice;
c10620	it a male without blemish.
c10621	he shall bring
c10622	And he shall kill it on the side of the altar northward before the LORD:
c10623	and the priests, Aaron's sons, shall sprinkle his blood round about upon the altar.
c10624	And he shall cut it into his pieces, with his head and his fat:
c10625	and the priest shall lay them in order on the wood
c10626	that <i>is</i> on the fire
c10627	which <i>is</i> upon the altar:
c10628	But he shall wash the inwards and the legs with water:
c10629	and the priest shall bring <i>it</i> all,
c10630	and burn <i>it</i> upon the altar:
c10631	it <i>is</i> a burnt sacrifice,
c10632	an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD.
c10633	And if the burnt sacrifice for his offering to the LORD <i>be</i> of fowls,
c10634	then he shall bring his offering of turtledoves, or of young pigeons.
c10635	And the priest shall bring it unto the altar,
c10636	and wring off his head,
c10637	and burn <i>it</i> on the altar;
c10638	and the blood thereof shall be wrung out at the side of the altar:
c10639	And he shall pluck away his crop with his feathers,
c10640	and cast it beside the altar on the east part, by the place of the ashes:
c10641	And he shall cleave it with the wings
c10642	thereof, <i>but</i> shall not divide <i>it</i> asunder:
c10643	and the priest shall burn it upon the altar, upon the wood
c10644	that <i>is</i> upon the fire:
c10645	it <i>is</i> a burnt sacrifice,
c10646	an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD.
c10648	And when any will offer a meat offering unto the LORD,
c10649	his offering shall be <i>of</i> fine flour;
c10650	and he shall pour oil upon
c10651	it, and put frankincense thereon:
c10652	And he shall bring it to Aaron's sons the priests:
c10653	and he shall take thereout his handful of the flour thereof, and of the oil thereof, with all the frankincense
c10654	thereof; and the priest shall burn the memorial of it upon the altar,
c10655	<i>to be</i> an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD:
c10656	And the remnant of the meat offering <i>shall be</i> Aaron's and his sons':
c10657	<i>it is</i> a thing most holy of the offerings of the LORD made by fire.
c10658	And if thou bring an oblation of a meat offering baken in the oven,
c10659	cakes of fine flour
c10660	<i>it shall be</i> unleavened
c10661	mingled with oil,
c10662	or unleavened wafers
c10663	anointed with oil.
c10664	And if thy oblation <i>be</i> a meat offering <i>baken</i> in a pan,
c10666	mingled with oil.
c10667	it shall be <i>of</i> fine flour unleavened,
c10668	Thou shalt part it in pieces,
c10669	and pour oil thereon:
c10670	it <i>is</i> a meat offering.
c10671	And if thy oblation <i>be</i> a meat offering <i>baken</i> in the fryingpan,
c10672	it shall be made <i>of</i> fine flour with oil.
c10673	And thou shalt bring the meat offering
c10674	that is made of these things
c10675	unto the LORD:
c10676	and when it is presented unto the priest,
c10677	he shall bring it unto the altar.
c10678	And the priest shall take from the meat offering a memorial
c10679	thereof, and shall burn <i>it</i> upon the altar:
c10680	<i>it is</i> an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD.
c10681	And that which is left of the meat offering <i>shall be</i> Aaron's and his sons':
c10682	<i>it is</i> a thing most holy of the offerings of the LORD made by fire.
c10684	which ye shall bring unto the LORD, shall be made with leaven:
c10685	No meat offering,
c10686	for ye shall burn no leaven, nor any honey,
c10687	in any offering of the LORD made by fire.
c10688	As for the oblation of the firstfruits,
c10689	ye shall offer them unto the LORD:
c10690	but they shall not be burnt on the altar for a sweet savour.
c10691	And every oblation of thy meat offering shalt thou season with salt;
c10692	neither shalt thou suffer the salt of the covenant of thy God to be lacking from thy meat offering:
c10693	with all thine offerings thou shalt offer salt.
c10694	And if thou offer a meat offering of thy firstfruits unto the LORD,
c10696	dried by the fire, <i>even</i> corn beaten out of full ears.
c10697	thou shalt offer for the meat offering of thy firstfruits green ears of corn
c10698	And thou shalt put oil upon
c10699	it, and lay frankincense thereon:
c10700	it <i>is</i> a meat offering.
c10701	And the priest shall burn the memorial of it, <i>part</i> of the beaten corn thereof, and <i>part</i> of the oil thereof, with all the frankincense
c10702	thereof: <i>it is</i> an offering made by fire unto the LORD.
c10703	And if his oblation <i>be</i> a sacrifice of peace offering,
c10704	if he offer <i>it</i> of the herd;
c10705	whether <i>it be</i> a male
c10706	or female,
c10707	he shall offer it without blemish before the LORD.
c10708	And he shall lay his hand upon the head of his offering,
c10709	and kill it <i>at</i> the door of the tabernacle of the congregation:
c10710	and Aaron's sons the priests shall sprinkle the blood upon the altar round about.
c10711	And he shall offer of the sacrifice of the peace offering an offering made by fire unto the LORD; the fat
c10712	that covereth the inwards,
c10713	and all the fat
c10714	that <i>is</i> upon the inwards,
c10715	And the two kidneys, and the fat
c10716	that <i>is</i> on
c10717	them, which <i>is</i> by the flanks,
c10718	and the caul above the liver, with the kidneys, it shall he take away.
c10719	And Aaron's sons shall burn it on the altar upon the burnt sacrifice,
c10720	which <i>is</i> upon the wood
c10721	that <i>is</i> on the fire:
c10722	<i>it is</i> an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD.
c10723	And if his offering for a sacrifice of peace offering unto the LORD <i>be</i> of the flock; male or female,
c10724	he shall offer it without blemish.
c10725	If he offer a lamb for his offering,
c10726	then shall he offer it before the LORD.
c10727	And he shall lay his hand upon the head of his offering,
c10728	and kill it before the tabernacle of the congregation:
c10729	and Aaron's sons shall sprinkle the blood thereof round about upon the altar.
c10730	And he shall offer of the sacrifice of the peace offering an offering made by fire unto the LORD; the fat thereof, <i>and</i> the whole rump,
c10731	it shall he take off hard by the backbone;
c10732	and the fat
c10733	that covereth the inwards,
c10734	and all the fat
c10735	that <i>is</i> upon the inwards,
c10736	And the two kidneys, and the fat
c10737	that <i>is</i> upon
c10738	them, which <i>is</i> by the flanks,
c10739	and the caul above the liver, with the kidneys, it shall he take away.
c10740	And the priest shall burn it upon the altar:
c10741	<i>it is</i> the food of the offering made by fire unto the LORD.
c10742	And if his offering <i>be</i> a goat,
c10743	then he shall offer it before the LORD.
c10744	And he shall lay his hand upon the head
c10745	of it, and kill it before the tabernacle of the congregation:
c10746	and the sons of Aaron shall sprinkle the blood thereof upon the altar round about.
c10747	And he shall offer thereof his offering, <i>even</i> an offering made by fire unto the LORD;
c10748	the fat
c10749	that covereth the inwards,
c10750	and all the fat
c10751	that <i>is</i> upon the inwards,
c10752	And the two kidneys, and the fat
c10753	that <i>is</i> upon
c10754	them, which <i>is</i> by the flanks,
c10755	and the caul above the liver, with the kidneys,
c10756	it shall he take away.
c10757	And the priest shall burn them upon the altar:
c10758	<i>it is</i> the food of the offering made by fire for a sweet savour:
c10759	all the fat <i>is</i> the LORD'S.
c10760	<i>It shall be</i> a perpetual statute for your generations throughout all your dwellings,
c10761	that ye eat neither fat nor blood.
c10762	And the LORD spake unto Moses,
c10763	saying,
c10764	Speak unto the children of Israel,
c10765	saying,
c10767	If a soul shall sin through ignorance against any of the commandments of the LORD
c10768	<i>concerning things</i> which ought not to be done,
c10769	and shall do against any of them:
c10770	If the priest that is anointed do sin
c10771	according to the sin of the people;
c10772	then let him bring for his sin,
c10773	which he hath sinned,
c10774	a young bullock without blemish unto the LORD for a sin offering.
c10775	And he shall bring the bullock unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation before the LORD;
c10776	and shall lay his hand upon the bullock's head,
c10777	and kill the bullock before the LORD.
c10778	And the priest that is anointed shall take of the bullock's blood,
c10779	and bring it to the tabernacle of the congregation:
c10780	And the priest shall dip his finger in the blood,
c10781	and sprinkle of the blood seven times before the LORD, before the vail of the sanctuary.
c10782	And the priest shall put <i>some</i> of the blood upon the horns of the altar of sweet incense before the LORD,
c10783	which <i>is</i> in the tabernacle of the congregation;
c10784	and shall pour all the blood of the bullock at the bottom of the altar of the burnt offering,
c10785	which <i>is at</i> the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.
c10786	And he shall take off from it all the fat of the bullock for the sin offering; the fat
c10787	that covereth the inwards,
c10788	and all the fat
c10789	that <i>is</i> upon the inwards,
c10790	And the two kidneys, and the fat
c10791	that <i>is</i> upon
c10792	them, which <i>is</i> by the flanks,
c10793	and the caul above the liver, with the kidneys, it shall he take away,
c10794	As it was taken off from the bullock of the sacrifice of peace offerings:
c10795	and the priest shall burn them upon the altar of the burnt offering.
c10796	And the skin of the bullock, and all his flesh, with his head, and with his legs, and his inwards, and his dung,
c10797	Even the whole bullock shall he carry forth without the camp unto a clean place, where the ashes are poured out,
c10798	and burn him on the wood with fire:
c10799	where the ashes are poured out shall he be burnt.
c10800	And if the whole congregation of Israel sin through ignorance,
c10801	and the thing be hid from the eyes of the assembly,
c10802	and they have done <i>somewhat against</i> any of the commandments of the LORD
c10803	<i>concerning things</i> which should not be done,
c10804	and are guilty;
c10805	When the sin, which they have sinned against it, is known,
c10807	then the congregation shall offer a young bullock for the sin,
c10808	and bring him before the tabernacle of the congregation.
c10809	And the elders of the congregation shall lay their hands upon the head of the bullock before the LORD:
c10810	and the bullock shall be killed before the LORD.
c10811	And the priest that is anointed shall bring of the bullock's blood to the tabernacle of the congregation:
c10812	And the priest shall dip his finger <i>in some</i> of the blood,
c10813	and sprinkle <i>it</i> seven times before the LORD, <i>even</i> before the vail.
c10814	And he shall put <i>some</i> of the blood upon the horns of the altar
c10815	which <i>is</i> before the LORD,
c10816	that <i>is</i> in the tabernacle of the congregation,
c10817	and shall pour out all the blood at the bottom of the altar of the burnt offering,
c10818	which <i>is at</i> the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.
c10819	And he shall take all his fat from
c10820	him, and burn <i>it</i> upon the altar.
c10821	And he shall do with the bullock
c10822	as he did with the bullock for a sin offering,
c10823	so shall he do
c10824	with this: and the priest shall make an atonement for
c10825	them, and it shall be forgiven them.
c10826	And he shall carry forth the bullock without the camp,
c10827	and burn
c10828	him as he burned the first bullock:
c10829	it <i>is</i> a sin offering for the congregation.
c10830	When a ruler hath sinned,
c10831	and done <i>somewhat</i> through ignorance <i>against</i> any of the commandments of the LORD his God
c10832	<i>concerning things</i> which should not be done,
c10834	and is guilty;
c10835	Or if his sin, wherein he hath sinned, come to his knowledge;
c10837	he shall bring his offering, a kid of the goats, a male without blemish:
c10838	And he shall lay his hand upon the head of the goat,
c10839	and kill it in the place
c10840	where they kill the burnt offering before the LORD:
c10841	it <i>is</i> a sin offering.
c10842	And the priest shall take of the blood of the sin offering with his finger,
c10843	and put <i>it</i> upon the horns of the altar of burnt offering,
c10844	and shall pour out his blood at the bottom of the altar of burnt offering.
c10845	And he shall burn all his fat upon the altar, as the fat of the sacrifice of peace offerings:
c10846	and the priest shall make an atonement for him as concerning his sin,
c10847	and it shall be forgiven him.
c10848	And if any one of the common people sin through ignorance,
c10849	while he doeth <i>somewhat against</i> any of the commandments of the LORD
c10850	<i>concerning things</i> which ought not to be done,
c10851	and be guilty;
c10852	Or if his sin, which he hath sinned, come to his knowledge:
c10854	then he shall bring his offering, a kid of the goats, a female without blemish, for his sin
c10855	which he hath sinned.
c10856	And he shall lay his hand upon the head of the sin offering,
c10857	and slay the sin offering in the place of the burnt offering.
c10858	And the priest shall take of the blood thereof with his finger,
c10859	and put <i>it</i> upon the horns of the altar of burnt offering,
c10860	and shall pour out all the blood thereof at the bottom of the altar.
c10861	And he shall take away all the fat
c10862	thereof, as the fat is taken away from off the sacrifice of peace offerings;
c10863	and the priest shall burn <i>it</i> upon the altar for a sweet savour unto the LORD;
c10864	and the priest shall make an atonement for
c10865	him, and it shall be forgiven him.
c10866	And if he bring a lamb for a sin offering,
c10867	he shall bring it a female without blemish.
c10868	And he shall lay his hand upon the head of the sin offering,
c10869	and slay it for a sin offering in the place
c10870	where they kill the burnt offering.
c10871	And the priest shall take of the blood of the sin offering with his finger,
c10872	and put <i>it</i> upon the horns of the altar of burnt offering,
c10873	and shall pour out all the blood thereof at the bottom of the altar:
c10874	And he shall take away all the fat
c10875	thereof, as the fat of the lamb is taken away from the sacrifice of the peace offerings;
c10876	and the priest shall burn them upon the altar, according to the offerings made by fire unto the LORD:
c10877	and the priest shall make an atonement for his sin
c10878	that he hath committed,
c10879	and it shall be forgiven him.
c10881	And if a soul sin,
c10882	and hear the voice of swearing,
c10883	and <i>is</i> a witness,
c10884	whether he hath seen
c10885	or known
c10886	<i>of it;</i> if he do not utter
c10887	<i>it,</i> then he shall bear his iniquity.
c10888	Or if a soul
c10889	touch any unclean thing, whether <i>it be</i> a carcase of an unclean beast, or a carcase of unclean cattle, or the carcase of unclean creeping things,
c10890	and <i>if</i> it be hidden from
c10891	him; he also shall be unclean,
c10892	and guilty.
c10893	Or if he touch the uncleanness of man, whatsoever uncleanness
c10894	<i>it be</i> that a man shall be defiled
c10895	withal, and it be hid from
c10896	him; when he knoweth
c10897	<i>of it,</i> then he shall be guilty.
c10898	Or if a soul
c10899	swear,
c10900	pronouncing with <i>his</i> lips
c10901	to do evil,
c10902	or to do good,
c10903	whatsoever
c10904	<i>it be</i> that a man shall pronounce with an oath,
c10905	and it be hid from
c10906	him; when he knoweth
c10907	<i>of it,</i> then he shall be guilty in one of these.
c10908	And it shall be,
c10909	when he shall be guilty in one of these
c10910	<i>things,</i> that he shall confess
c10911	that he hath sinned in that <i>thing:</i>
c10912	And he shall bring his trespass offering unto the LORD for his sin
c10913	which he hath sinned,
c10914	a female from the flock, a lamb or a kid of the goats, for a sin offering;
c10915	and the priest shall make an atonement for him concerning his sin.
c10916	And if he be not able to bring a lamb,
c10917	then he shall bring for his trespass,
c10918	which he hath committed,
c10919	two turtledoves, or two young pigeons, unto the LORD;
c10920	one for a sin offering,
c10921	and the other for a burnt offering.
c10922	And he shall bring them unto the priest,
c10923	who shall offer
c10924	<i>that</i> which <i>is</i> for the sin offering
c10925	first,
c10926	and wring off his head from his neck,
c10927	but shall not divide <i>it</i> asunder:
c10928	And he shall sprinkle of the blood of the sin offering upon the side of the altar;
c10930	and the rest of the blood
c10931	shall be wrung out at the bottom of the altar:
c10932	it <i>is</i> a sin offering.
c10933	And he shall offer the second <i>for</i> a burnt offering, according to the manner:
c10934	and the priest shall make an atonement for him for his sin
c10935	which he hath sinned,
c10936	and it shall be forgiven him.
c10937	But if he be not able to bring two turtledoves, or two young pigeons,
c10938	shall bring for his offering
c10939	then he that sinned
c10940	the tenth part of an ephah of fine flour for a sin offering;
c10941	he shall put no oil upon
c10942	it, neither shall he put <i>any</i> frankincense thereon:
c10943	for it <i>is</i> a sin offering.
c10944	Then shall he bring it to the priest,
c10945	and the priest shall take his handful of it, <i>even</i> a memorial
c10946	thereof, and burn <i>it</i> on the altar, according to the offerings made by fire unto the LORD:
c10947	it <i>is</i> a sin offering.
c10948	And the priest shall make an atonement for him as touching his sin
c10949	that he hath sinned
c10950	in one of these,
c10951	and it shall be forgiven
c10952	him: and <i>the remnant</i> shall be the priest's, as a meat offering.
c10953	And the LORD spake unto Moses,
c10954	saying,
c10956	If a soul commit a trespass,
c10957	and sin through ignorance, in the holy things of the LORD;
c10958	then he shall bring for his trespass unto the LORD a ram without blemish out of the flocks,
c10959	with thy estimation by shekels of silver, after the shekel of the sanctuary,
c10960	for a trespass offering:
c10962	for the harm that he hath done in the holy thing,
c10963	And he shall make amends
c10964	and shall add the fifth part thereto,
c10965	and give it unto the priest:
c10966	and the priest shall make an atonement for him with the ram of the trespass offering,
c10967	and it shall be forgiven him.
c10968	And if a soul
c10969	sin,
c10970	and commit any of these things which are forbidden to be done by the commandments of the LORD;
c10972	though he wist <i>it</i> not,
c10973	yet is he guilty,
c10974	and shall bear his iniquity.
c10975	And he shall bring a ram without blemish out of the flock, with thy estimation, for a trespass offering, unto the priest:
c10976	and the priest shall make an atonement for him concerning his ignorance
c10977	wherein he erred
c10978	and wist <i>it</i> not,
c10979	and it shall be forgiven him.
c10980	It <i>is</i> a trespass offering:
c10981	he hath certainly trespassed against the LORD.
c10982	And the LORD spake unto Moses,
c10983	saying,
c10985	If a soul sin,
c10986	and commit a trespass against the LORD,
c10987	and lie unto his neighbour in that which was delivered him to keep, or in fellowship, or in a thing taken away by violence,
c10988	or hath deceived his neighbour;
c10989	Or have found that which was lost,
c10990	and lieth
c10991	concerning it, and sweareth falsely; in any of all
c10992	these that a man doeth,
c10993	sinning therein:
c10994	Then it shall be,
c10995	because he hath sinned,
c10996	and is guilty,
c10997	that he shall restore that which he took violently away,
c10999	or the thing
c11000	which he hath deceitfully gotten,
c11001	or that
c11002	which was delivered him to keep,
c11003	or the lost thing
c11004	which he found,
c11005	Or all that
c11006	about which he hath sworn falsely;
c11007	he shall even restore it in the principal,
c11008	and shall add the fifth part more thereto,
c11010	<i>and</i> give it unto him to whom it appertaineth, in the day
c11011	of his trespass offering.
c11012	And he shall bring his trespass offering unto the LORD,
c11013	a ram without blemish out of the flock, with thy estimation, for a trespass offering, unto the priest:
c11014	And the priest shall make an atonement for him before the LORD:
c11015	and it shall be forgiven him for any thing of all
c11016	that he hath done in trespassing therein.
c11017	And the LORD spake unto Moses,
c11018	saying,
c11019	Command Aaron and his sons,
c11020	saying,
c11021	This <i>is</i> the law of the burnt offering:
c11022	It <i>is</i> the burnt offering,
c11023	because of the burning upon the altar all night unto the morning,
c11024	and the fire of the altar
c11025	shall be burning in it.
c11026	And the priest shall put on his linen garment,
c11027	and his linen breeches shall he put upon his flesh,
c11028	and take up the ashes
c11029	which the fire hath consumed with the burnt offering on the altar,
c11030	and he shall put them beside the altar.
c11031	And he shall put off his garments,
c11032	and put on other garments,
c11033	and carry forth the ashes without the camp unto a clean place.
c11034	And the fire upon the altar shall be burning
c11035	in it; it shall not be put out:
c11036	and the priest shall burn wood on it every morning,
c11037	and lay the burnt offering in order upon
c11038	it; and he shall burn thereon the fat of the peace offerings.
c11039	The fire shall ever be burning upon the altar;
c11040	it shall never go out.
c11041	And this <i>is</i> the law of the meat offering:
c11042	the sons of Aaron shall offer it before the LORD, before the altar.
c11043	And he shall take of it his handful, of the flour of the meat offering, and of the oil
c11044	thereof, and all the frankincense
c11045	which <i>is</i> upon the meat offering,
c11046	and shall burn <i>it</i> upon the altar
c11047	<i>for</i> a sweet savour, <i>even</i> the memorial of it, unto the LORD.
c11049	And the remainder thereof
c11050	shall Aaron and his sons eat:
c11051	with unleavened bread shall it be eaten in the holy place;
c11052	in the court of the tabernacle of the congregation they shall eat it.
c11053	It shall not be baken with leaven.
c11054	I have given it <i>unto them for</i> their portion of my offerings made by fire;
c11055	it <i>is</i> most holy,
c11056	as <i>is</i> the sin offering, and as the trespass offering.
c11057	All the males among the children of Aaron shall eat
c11058	of it. <i>It shall be</i> a statute for ever in your generations concerning the offerings of the LORD made by fire:
c11059	every one
c11060	that toucheth
c11061	them shall be holy.
c11062	And the LORD spake unto Moses,
c11063	saying,
c11064	This <i>is</i> the offering of Aaron and of his sons,
c11065	which they shall offer unto the LORD in the day
c11066	when he is anointed;
c11067	the tenth part of an ephah of fine flour
c11068	for a meat offering perpetual,
c11069	half of it in the morning,
c11070	and half thereof at night.
c11071	In a pan it shall be made with oil;
c11072	<i>and when it is</i> baken, thou shalt bring it in:
c11073	<i>and</i> the baken pieces of the meat offering shalt thou offer
c11074	<i>for</i> a sweet savour unto the LORD.
c11075	And the priest
c11076	of his sons that is anointed in his stead
c11077	shall offer
c11078	it: <i>it is</i> a statute for ever unto the LORD;
c11079	it shall be wholly burnt.
c11080	For every meat offering for the priest shall be wholly
c11081	burnt: it shall not be eaten.
c11082	And the LORD spake unto Moses,
c11083	saying,
c11084	Speak unto Aaron and to his sons,
c11085	saying,
c11086	This <i>is</i> the law of the sin offering:
c11087	In the place
c11088	where the burnt offering is killed
c11089	shall the sin offering be killed before the LORD:
c11090	it <i>is</i> most holy.
c11091	The priest
c11092	that offereth it for sin
c11093	shall eat
c11094	it: in the holy place shall it be eaten, in the court of the tabernacle of the congregation.
c11095	Whatsoever
c11096	shall touch the flesh
c11097	thereof shall be holy:
c11098	and when there is sprinkled of the blood thereof upon any garment,
c11100	thou shalt wash that whereon it was sprinkled in the holy place.
c11101	But the earthen vessel
c11102	wherein it is sodden
c11103	shall be broken:
c11104	and if it be sodden in a brasen pot,
c11105	it shall be both scoured,
c11106	and rinsed in water.
c11107	All the males among the priests shall eat
c11108	thereof: it <i>is</i> most holy.
c11110	whereof <i>any</i> of the blood is brought into the tabernacle of the congregation
c11111	to reconcile <i>withal</i> in the holy <i>place,</i> shall be eaten:
c11112	And no sin offering,
c11113	it shall be burnt in the fire.
c11114	Likewise this <i>is</i> the law of the trespass offering:
c11115	it <i>is</i> most holy.
c11116	In the place
c11117	where they kill the burnt offering
c11118	shall they kill the trespass offering:
c11119	and the blood thereof shall he sprinkle round about upon the altar.
c11120	And he shall offer of it all the fat thereof; the rump, and the fat
c11121	that covereth the inwards,
c11122	And the two kidneys, and the fat
c11123	that <i>is</i> on
c11124	them, which <i>is</i> by the flanks,
c11125	and the caul <i>that is</i> above the liver, with the kidneys, it shall he take away:
c11126	And the priest shall burn them upon the altar
c11127	<i>for</i> an offering made by fire unto the LORD:
c11128	it <i>is</i> a trespass offering.
c11129	Every male among the priests shall eat
c11130	thereof: it shall be eaten in the holy place:
c11131	it <i>is</i> most holy.
c11132	As the sin offering <i>is,</i> so <i>is</i> the trespass offering:
c11133	<i>there is</i> one law
c11134	for them: the priest
c11135	that maketh atonement
c11136	therewith shall have <i>it.</i>
c11137	And the priest
c11138	that offereth any man's burnt offering,
c11139	to himself the skin of the burnt offering
c11140	which he hath offered.
c11141	<i>even</i> the priest
c11142	shall have
c11143	And all the meat offering
c11144	that is baken in the oven,
c11145	and all
c11146	that is dressed in the fryingpan, and in the pan,
c11147	the priest's
c11148	that offereth it.
c11149	shall be
c11150	And every meat offering,
c11151	mingled with oil,
c11152	and dry,
c11153	shall all the sons of Aaron have,
c11154	one <i>as much</i> as another.
c11155	And this <i>is</i> the law of the sacrifice of peace offerings,
c11156	which he shall offer unto the LORD.
c11157	If he offer it for a thanksgiving,
c11158	then he shall offer with the sacrifice of thanksgiving unleavened cakes
c11159	mingled with oil,
c11160	and unleavened wafers
c11161	anointed with oil,
c11162	of fine flour, fried.
c11163	and cakes
c11164	mingled with oil,
c11165	Besides the cakes, he shall offer <i>for</i> his offering leavened bread
c11166	with the sacrifice of thanksgiving of his peace offerings.
c11167	And of it he shall offer one out of the whole oblation <i>for</i> an heave offering unto the LORD,
c11168	the priest's
c11169	that sprinkleth the blood of the peace offerings.
c11170	<i>and</i> it shall be
c11171	And the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offerings for thanksgiving shall be eaten the same day that it is offered;
c11172	he shall not leave any of it until the morning.
c11173	But if the sacrifice of his offering <i>be</i> a vow, or a voluntary offering,
c11174	the same day
c11175	that he offereth his sacrifice:
c11176	it shall be eaten
c11177	and on the morrow
c11179	also the remainder of
c11180	it shall be eaten:
c11182	But the remainder of the flesh of the sacrifice on the third day
c11183	shall be burnt with fire.
c11184	And if <i>any</i> of the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offerings be eaten at all on the third day, it shall not be accepted,
c11186	unto him that offereth
c11187	neither shall it be imputed
c11188	it: it shall be an abomination,
c11189	and the soul that eateth
c11190	of
c11191	it shall bear his iniquity.
c11192	And the flesh
c11193	that toucheth any unclean
c11194	<i>thing</i> shall not be eaten;
c11195	it shall be burnt with fire:
c11196	and as for the flesh,
c11197	all that be clean shall eat thereof.
c11198	But the soul
c11199	that eateth <i>of</i> the flesh of the sacrifice of peace offerings,
c11200	that <i>pertain</i> unto the LORD,
c11201	having his uncleanness upon
c11202	him, even that soul shall be cut off from his people.
c11203	Moreover the soul
c11204	that shall touch any unclean <i>thing, as</i> the uncleanness of man, or <i>any</i> unclean beast, or any abominable unclean
c11205	<i>thing,</i> and eat of the flesh of the sacrifice of peace offerings,
c11206	which <i>pertain</i> unto the LORD,
c11207	even that soul shall be cut off from his people.
c11208	And the LORD spake unto Moses,
c11209	saying,
c11210	Speak unto the children of Israel,
c11211	saying,
c11212	Ye shall eat no manner of fat, of ox, or of sheep, or of goat.
c11213	And the fat of the beast that dieth of itself, and the fat of that which is torn with beasts, may be used in any other use:
c11214	but ye shall in no wise eat of it.
c11215	For whosoever
c11216	eateth the fat of the beast,
c11217	of which men offer an offering made by fire unto the LORD,
c11218	even the soul that eateth <i>it</i> shall be cut off
c11220	from his people.
c11221	Moreover ye shall eat no manner of blood, <i>whether it be</i> of fowl or of beast, in any of your dwellings.
c11222	Whatsoever soul
c11223	<i>it be</i> that eateth any manner of blood,
c11224	even that soul shall be cut off from his people.
c11225	And the LORD spake unto Moses,
c11226	saying,
c11227	Speak unto the children of Israel,
c11228	saying,
c11229	He that offereth the sacrifice of his peace offerings unto the LORD
c11230	shall bring his oblation unto the LORD of the sacrifice of his peace offerings.
c11231	His own hands shall bring the offerings of the LORD made by fire,
c11232	the fat with the breast,
c11233	it shall he bring,
c11234	that the breast
c11235	may be waved <i>for</i> a wave offering before the LORD.
c11236	And the priest shall burn the fat upon the altar:
c11237	but the breast shall be Aaron's and his sons'.
c11238	And the right shoulder shall ye give unto the priest <i>for</i> an heave offering of the sacrifices of your peace offerings.
c11239	that offereth the blood of the peace offerings, and the fat,
c11240	He among the sons of Aaron,
c11241	shall have the right shoulder for <i>his</i> part.
c11242	For the wave breast and the heave shoulder have I taken of the children of Israel from off the sacrifices of their peace offerings,
c11243	and have given them unto Aaron the priest and unto his sons by a statute for ever from among the children of Israel.
c11244	This <i>is the portion</i> of the anointing of Aaron, and of the anointing of his sons, out of the offerings of the LORD made by fire, in the day
c11245	<i>when</i> he presented
c11246	them to minister unto the LORD in the priest's office;
c11247	Which the LORD commanded
c11248	to be given
c11249	in the day
c11250	that he anointed
c11251	them of the children of Israel,
c11252	them, <i>by</i> a statute for ever throughout their generations.
c11253	This <i>is</i> the law of the burnt offering, of the meat offering, and of the sin offering, and of the trespass offering, and of the consecrations, and of the sacrifice of the peace offerings;
c11254	Which the LORD commanded Moses in mount Sinai, in the day
c11255	that he commanded the children of Israel
c11256	to offer their oblations unto the LORD, in the wilderness of Sinai.
c11257	And the LORD spake unto Moses,
c11258	saying,
c11259	Take Aaron and his sons with him, and the garments, and the anointing oil, and a bullock for the sin offering, and two rams, and a basket of unleavened bread;
c11260	And gather thou all the congregation together unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.
c11261	And Moses did
c11262	as the LORD commanded
c11263	him; and the assembly was gathered together unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.
c11264	And Moses said unto the congregation,
c11265	This <i>is</i> the thing
c11266	which the LORD commanded
c11267	to be done.
c11268	And Moses brought Aaron and his sons,
c11269	and washed them with water.
c11270	And he put upon him the coat,
c11271	and girded him with the girdle,
c11272	and clothed him with the robe,
c11273	and put the ephod upon
c11274	him, and he girded him with the curious girdle of the ephod,
c11275	and bound <i>it</i> unto him therewith.
c11276	And he put the breastplate upon
c11277	him: also he put in the breastplate the Urim and the Thummim.
c11278	And he put the mitre upon his head;
c11279	also upon the mitre, <i>even</i> upon his forefront, did he put the golden plate, the holy crown;
c11280	as the LORD commanded Moses.
c11281	And Moses took the anointing oil,
c11282	and anointed the tabernacle and all
c11283	that
c11284	<i>was</i> therein, and sanctified them.
c11285	And he sprinkled thereof upon the altar seven times,
c11286	and anointed the altar and all his vessels, both the laver and his foot,
c11287	to sanctify them.
c11288	And he poured of the anointing oil upon Aaron's head,
c11289	and anointed
c11290	him, to sanctify him.
c11291	And Moses brought Aaron's sons,
c11292	and put coats upon
c11293	them, and girded them with girdles,
c11294	and put bonnets
c11295	upon them; as the LORD commanded Moses.
c11296	And he brought the bullock for the sin offering:
c11297	and Aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the bullock for the sin offering.
c11298	And he slew
c11299	<i>it;</i> and Moses took the blood,
c11300	and put <i>it</i> upon the horns of the altar round about with his finger,
c11301	and purified the altar,
c11302	and poured the blood at the bottom of the altar,
c11303	and sanctified
c11304	it, to make reconciliation upon it.
c11305	And he took all the fat
c11306	that <i>was</i> upon the inwards,
c11307	and the caul <i>above</i> the liver, and the two kidneys, and their fat,
c11308	and Moses burned <i>it</i> upon the altar.
c11309	But the bullock, and his hide, his flesh, and his dung, he burnt with fire without the camp;
c11310	as the LORD commanded Moses.
c11311	And he brought the ram for the burnt offering:
c11312	and Aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the ram.
c11313	And he killed
c11314	<i>it;</i> and Moses sprinkled the blood upon the altar round about.
c11315	And he cut the ram into pieces;
c11316	and Moses burnt the head, and the pieces, and the fat.
c11317	And he washed the inwards and the legs in water;
c11318	and Moses burnt the whole ram upon the altar:
c11319	it <i>was</i> a burnt sacrifice for a sweet savour,
c11320	<i>and</i> an offering made by fire unto the LORD;
c11321	as the LORD commanded Moses.
c11322	And he brought the other ram, the ram of consecration:
c11323	and Aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the ram.
c11324	And he slew
c11325	<i>it;</i> and Moses took of the blood
c11326	of it, and put <i>it</i> upon the tip of Aaron's right ear, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot.
c11327	And he brought Aaron's sons,
c11328	and Moses put of the blood upon the tip of their right ear, and upon the thumbs of their right hands, and upon the great toes of their right feet:
c11329	and Moses sprinkled the blood upon the altar round about.
c11330	And he took the fat, and the rump, and all the fat
c11331	that <i>was</i> upon the inwards,
c11332	and the caul <i>above</i> the liver, and the two kidneys, and their fat, and the right shoulder:
c11333	And out of the basket of unleavened bread,
c11334	that <i>was</i> before the LORD,
c11335	he took one unleavened cake, and a cake of oiled bread, and one wafer,
c11336	and put <i>them</i> on the fat, and upon the right shoulder:
c11337	And he put all upon Aaron's hands, and upon his sons' hands,
c11338	and waved them <i>for</i> a wave offering before the LORD.
c11339	And Moses took them from off their hands,
c11340	and burnt <i>them</i> on the altar upon the burnt offering:
c11341	they <i>were</i> consecrations for a sweet savour:
c11342	it <i>is</i> an offering made by fire unto the LORD.
c11343	And Moses took the breast,
c11344	and waved it <i>for</i> a wave offering before the LORD:
c11345	<i>for</i> of the ram of consecration it was Moses' part;
c11346	as the LORD commanded Moses.
c11347	And Moses took of the anointing oil, and of the blood
c11348	which <i>was</i> upon the altar,
c11349	and sprinkled <i>it</i> upon Aaron, <i>and</i> upon his garments, and upon his sons, and upon his sons' garments with
c11350	him; and sanctified Aaron, <i>and</i> his garments, and his sons, and his sons' garments with him.
c11351	And Moses said unto Aaron and to his sons,
c11352	Boil the flesh <i>at</i> the door of the tabernacle of the congregation:
c11353	and there eat it with the bread
c11354	that <i>is</i> in the basket of consecrations,
c11355	as I commanded,
c11356	saying,
c11357	Aaron and his sons shall eat it.
c11359	And that which remaineth of the flesh and of the bread
c11360	shall ye burn with fire.
c11361	And ye shall not go out of the door of the tabernacle of the congregation <i>in</i> seven days, until the days
c11362	of your consecration be at an end: for seven days
c11363	shall he consecrate you.
c11364	As he hath done this day,
c11365	<i>so</i> the LORD hath commanded
c11366	to do,
c11367	to make an atonement for you.
c11368	Therefore shall ye abide <i>at</i> the door of the tabernacle of the congregation day and night seven days,
c11369	and keep the charge of the LORD,
c11370	that ye die not:
c11371	for so I am commanded.
c11372	So Aaron and his sons did all things
c11373	which the LORD commanded by the hand of Moses.
c11374	And it came to pass on the eighth day,
c11375	<i>that</i> Moses called Aaron and his sons, and the elders of Israel;
c11376	And he said unto Aaron,
c11377	Take thee a young calf for a sin offering, and a ram for a burnt offering, without blemish,
c11378	and offer <i>them</i> before the LORD.
c11379	And unto the children of Israel thou shalt speak,
c11380	saying,
c11381	Take ye a kid of the goats for a sin offering; and a calf and a lamb, <i>both</i> of the first year, without blemish, for a burnt offering;
c11382	Also a bullock and a ram for peace offerings,
c11383	to sacrifice before the LORD;
c11384	and a meat offering
c11385	mingled with oil:
c11386	for to day the LORD will appear unto you.
c11387	And they brought
c11388	<i>that</i> which Moses commanded
c11389	before the tabernacle of the congregation:
c11390	and all the congregation drew near
c11391	and stood before the LORD.
c11392	And Moses said,
c11393	This <i>is</i> the thing
c11394	which the LORD commanded
c11395	that ye should do:
c11396	and the glory of the LORD shall appear unto you.
c11397	And Moses said unto Aaron,
c11398	Go unto the altar,
c11399	and offer thy sin offering, and thy burnt offering,
c11400	and make an atonement for thyself, and for the people:
c11401	and offer the offering of the people,
c11402	and make an atonement for
c11403	them; as the LORD commanded.
c11404	Aaron therefore went unto the altar,
c11405	and slew the calf of the sin offering,
c11406	which <i>was</i> for himself.
c11407	And the sons of Aaron brought the blood unto
c11408	him: and he dipped his finger in the blood,
c11409	and put <i>it</i> upon the horns of the altar,
c11410	and poured out the blood at the bottom of the altar:
c11411	But the fat, and the kidneys, and the caul above the liver of the sin offering, he burnt upon the altar;
c11412	as the LORD commanded Moses.
c11413	And the flesh and the hide he burnt with fire without the camp.
c11414	And he slew the burnt offering;
c11415	and Aaron's sons presented unto him the blood,
c11416	which he sprinkled round about upon the altar.
c11417	And they presented the burnt offering unto him, with the pieces thereof, and the head:
c11418	and he burnt <i>them</i> upon the altar.
c11419	And he did wash the inwards and the legs,
c11420	and burnt <i>them</i> upon the burnt offering on the altar.
c11421	And he brought the people's offering,
c11422	and took the goat, which <i>was</i> the sin offering
c11423	for the people,
c11424	and slew
c11425	it, and offered it for sin, as the first.
c11426	And he brought the burnt offering,
c11427	and offered it according to the manner.
c11428	And he brought the meat offering,
c11429	and took an handful thereof,
c11430	and burnt <i>it</i> upon the altar, beside the burnt sacrifice of the morning.
c11431	He slew also the bullock and the ram <i>for</i> a sacrifice of peace offerings,
c11432	which <i>was</i> for the people:
c11433	and Aaron's sons presented unto him the blood,
c11434	which he sprinkled upon the altar round about,
c11435	And the fat of the bullock and of the ram, the rump, and that which covereth <i>the inwards,</i> and the kidneys, and the caul <i>above</i> the liver:
c11436	And they put the fat upon the breasts,
c11437	and he burnt the fat upon the altar:
c11438	And the breasts and the right shoulder Aaron waved <i>for</i> a wave offering before the LORD;
c11439	as Moses commanded.
c11440	And Aaron lifted up his hand toward the people,
c11441	and blessed
c11442	them, and came down
c11443	from offering of the sin offering, and the burnt offering, and peace offerings.
c11444	And Moses and Aaron went into the tabernacle of the congregation,
c11445	and came out,
c11446	and blessed the people:
c11447	and the glory of the LORD appeared unto all the people.
c11448	And there came a fire out from before the LORD,
c11449	and consumed upon the altar the burnt offering and the fat:
c11450	<i>which</i> when all the people saw,
c11451	they shouted,
c11452	and fell on their faces.
c11453	And Nadab and Abihu, the sons of Aaron, took either of them his censer,
c11454	and put fire therein,
c11455	and put incense thereon,
c11456	and offered strange fire before the LORD,
c11457	which he commanded them not.
c11458	And there went out fire from the LORD,
c11459	and devoured
c11460	them, and they died before the LORD.
c11461	Then Moses said unto Aaron,
c11462	This
c11463	<i>is it</i> that the LORD spake,
c11464	saying,
c11465	I will be sanctified in them that come nigh
c11466	me, and before all the people I will be glorified.
c11467	And Aaron held his peace.
c11468	And Moses called Mishael and Elzaphan, the sons of Uzziel the uncle of Aaron, and said unto
c11470	them, Come near,
c11471	carry your brethren from before the sanctuary out of the camp.
c11472	So they went near,
c11473	and carried them in their coats out of the camp;
c11474	as Moses had said.
c11475	And Moses said unto Aaron,
c11476	and unto Eleazar and unto Ithamar, his sons,
c11477	Uncover not your heads,
c11478	neither rend your clothes;
c11479	lest ye die,
c11480	and lest wrath come upon all the people:
c11481	but let your brethren, the whole house of Israel, bewail the burning
c11482	which the LORD hath kindled.
c11483	And ye shall not go out from the door of the tabernacle of the congregation,
c11484	lest ye die:
c11485	for the anointing oil of the LORD <i>is</i> upon
c11486	you. And they did according to the word of Moses.
c11487	And the LORD spake unto Aaron,
c11488	saying,
c11489	Do not drink wine nor strong drink, thou, nor thy sons with
c11490	thee, when ye go into the tabernacle of the congregation,
c11491	lest ye die:
c11492	<i>it shall be</i> a statute for ever throughout your generations:
c11493	And that ye may put difference between holy and unholy, and between unclean and clean;
c11494	And that ye may teach the children of Israel all the statutes
c11495	which the LORD hath spoken unto them by the hand of Moses.
c11496	And Moses spake unto Aaron, and unto Eleazar and unto Ithamar, his sons that were left,
c11497	Take the meat offering
c11498	that remaineth of the offerings of the LORD made by fire,
c11499	and eat it without leaven beside the altar:
c11500	for it <i>is</i> most holy:
c11501	And ye shall eat it in the holy place,
c11502	because it <i>is</i> thy due, and thy sons' due, of the sacrifices of the LORD made by fire:
c11503	for so I am commanded.
c11504	And the wave breast and heave shoulder shall ye eat in a clean place; thou, and thy sons, and thy daughters with
c11505	thee: for <i>they be</i> thy due, and thy sons' due,
c11506	<i>which</i> are given out of the sacrifices of peace offerings of the children of Israel.
c11507	The heave shoulder and the wave breast shall they bring with the offerings made by fire of the fat,
c11508	to wave <i>it for</i> a wave offering before the LORD;
c11509	and it shall be thine, and thy sons' with thee, by a statute for ever;
c11510	as the LORD hath commanded.
c11511	And Moses diligently sought the goat of the sin offering,
c11512	and, behold, it was burnt:
c11513	and he was angry with Eleazar and Ithamar, the sons of Aaron <i>which were</i> left
c11514	<i>alive,</i> saying,
c11515	Wherefore have ye not eaten the sin offering in the holy place,
c11516	seeing it <i>is</i> most holy,
c11517	and <i>God</i> hath given
c11518	it you to bear the iniquity of the congregation,
c11519	to make atonement for them before the LORD?
c11520	Behold,
c11521	the blood of it was not brought in within the holy
c11522	<i>place:</i> ye should indeed have eaten it in the holy
c11523	<i>place,</i> as I commanded.
c11524	And Aaron said unto Moses,
c11525	Behold, this day have they offered their sin offering and their burnt offering before the LORD;
c11526	and such things have befallen
c11527	me: and <i>if</i> I had eaten the sin offering to day,
c11528	should it have been accepted in the sight of the LORD?
c11529	And when Moses heard
c11530	<i>that,</i> he was content.
c11531	And the LORD spake unto Moses and to Aaron,
c11532	saying unto them,
c11533	Speak unto the children of Israel,
c11534	saying,
c11535	These <i>are</i> the beasts
c11536	which ye shall eat among all the beasts
c11537	that <i>are</i> on the earth.
c11538	Whatsoever
c11539	parteth the hoof,
c11540	and is clovenfooted,
c11541	<i>and</i> cheweth the cud,
c11542	among the beasts,
c11543	that shall ye eat.
c11544	Nevertheless these shall ye not eat of them that chew the cud, or of them that divide the hoof:
c11545	<i>as</i> the camel,
c11546	because he cheweth the cud,
c11547	but divideth not the hoof;
c11548	he <i>is</i> unclean unto you.
c11549	And the coney,
c11550	because he cheweth the cud,
c11551	but divideth not the hoof;
c11552	he <i>is</i> unclean unto you.
c11553	And the hare,
c11554	because he cheweth the cud,
c11555	but divideth not the hoof;
c11556	he <i>is</i> unclean unto you.
c11557	And the swine,
c11558	though he divide the hoof,
c11559	and be clovenfooted,
c11560	yet he cheweth not the cud;
c11561	he <i>is</i> unclean to you.
c11562	Of their flesh shall ye not eat,
c11563	and their carcase shall ye not touch;
c11564	they <i>are</i> unclean to you.
c11565	These shall ye eat of all
c11566	that <i>are</i> in the waters:
c11567	whatsoever
c11568	hath fins and scales in the waters, in the seas, and in the rivers,
c11569	them shall ye eat.
c11570	And all
c11571	that have not fins and scales in the seas, and in the rivers,
c11572	of all that move in the waters, and of any living thing
c11573	which <i>is</i> in the waters,
c11574	they <i>shall be</i> an abomination unto you:
c11575	They shall be even an abomination
c11576	unto you; ye shall not eat of their flesh,
c11577	but ye shall have their carcases in abomination.
c11578	Whatsoever
c11579	hath no fins nor scales
c11580	in the waters,
c11581	that <i>shall be</i> an abomination unto you.
c11582	And these <i>are they which</i> ye shall have in abomination among the fowls;
c11583	they shall not be eaten,
c11584	they <i>are</i> an abomination:
c11585	the eagle, and the ossifrage, and the ospray,
c11586	And the vulture, and the kite after his kind;
c11587	Every raven after his kind;
c11588	And the owl, and the night hawk, and the cuckow, and the hawk after his kind,
c11589	And the little owl, and the cormorant, and the great owl,
c11590	And the swan, and the pelican, and the gier eagle,
c11591	And the stork, the heron after her kind, and the lapwing, and the bat.
c11592	All fowls that creep,
c11593	going upon <i>all</i> four,
c11594	<i>shall be</i> an abomination unto you.
c11595	Yet these may ye eat of every flying creeping thing
c11596	that goeth upon <i>all</i> four,
c11597	which have legs above their feet,
c11598	to leap withal upon the earth;
c11599	<i>Even</i> these of them ye may eat;
c11600	the locust after his kind, and the bald locust after his kind, and the beetle after his kind, and the grasshopper after his kind.
c11601	But all <i>other</i> flying creeping things,
c11602	which have four feet,
c11603	<i>shall be</i> an abomination unto you.
c11604	And for these ye shall be unclean:
c11605	whosoever
c11606	toucheth the carcase
c11607	of them shall be unclean until the even.
c11608	And whosoever
c11609	beareth <i>ought</i> of the carcase
c11610	of them shall wash his clothes,
c11611	and be unclean until the even.
c11612	<i>The carcases</i> of every beast
c11613	which divideth the hoof,
c11614	and <i>is</i> not clovenfooted,
c11615	nor cheweth the cud,
c11616	<i>are</i> unclean
c11617	unto you: every one
c11618	that toucheth
c11619	them shall be unclean.
c11620	And whatsoever
c11621	goeth upon his paws,
c11622	among all manner of beasts
c11623	that go on <i>all</i> four,
c11624	those <i>are</i> unclean
c11625	unto you: whoso
c11626	toucheth their carcase
c11627	shall be unclean until the even.
c11629	And he that beareth the carcase
c11630	of them shall wash his clothes,
c11631	and be unclean until the even:
c11632	they <i>are</i> unclean unto you.
c11633	These also <i>shall be</i> unclean unto you among the creeping things
c11634	that creep upon the earth;
c11635	the weasel, and the mouse, and the tortoise after his kind,
c11636	And the ferret, and the chameleon, and the lizard, and the snail, and the mole.
c11637	These <i>are</i> unclean to you among all that creep:
c11638	whosoever
c11639	doth touch them, when they be dead,
c11640	shall be unclean until the even.
c11642	And upon whatsoever
c11643	<i>any</i> of them, when they are dead, doth fall, it shall be unclean; whether <i>it be</i> any vessel of wood, or raiment, or skin, or sack,
c11644	whatsoever vessel
c11645	<i>it be,</i> wherein <i>any</i> work is done,
c11646	it must be put into water,
c11647	and it shall be unclean until the even;
c11648	so it shall be cleansed.
c11649	And every earthen vessel,
c11650	whereinto <i>any</i> of them falleth,
c11651	whatsoever
c11652	<i>is</i> in
c11653	it shall be unclean;
c11654	and ye shall break it.
c11655	Of all meat
c11656	which may be eaten,
c11657	<i>that</i> on which <i>such</i> water cometh
c11658	shall be unclean:
c11659	and all drink
c11660	that may be drunk in every <i>such</i> vessel
c11661	shall be unclean.
c11662	And every
c11663	<i>thing</i> whereupon <i>any part</i> of their carcase falleth
c11664	shall be unclean;
c11665	<i>whether it be</i> oven, or ranges for pots, they shall be broken down:
c11666	<i>for</i> they <i>are</i> unclean,
c11667	and shall be unclean unto you.
c11668	Nevertheless a fountain or pit, <i>wherein there is</i> plenty of water, shall be clean:
c11670	but that which toucheth their carcase
c11671	shall be unclean.
c11672	And if <i>any part</i> of their carcase fall upon any sowing seed
c11673	which is to be sown,
c11674	it <i>shall be</i> clean.
c11675	But if <i>any</i> water be put upon the seed,
c11676	and <i>any part</i> of their carcase fall thereon,
c11677	it <i>shall be</i> unclean unto you.
c11678	And if any beast, of which ye may eat, die;
c11680	he that toucheth the carcase
c11681	thereof shall be unclean until the even.
c11683	And he that eateth of the carcase
c11684	of it shall wash his clothes,
c11685	and be unclean until the even:
c11687	he also that beareth the carcase
c11688	of it shall wash his clothes,
c11689	and be unclean until the even.
c11690	And every creeping thing
c11691	that creepeth upon the earth
c11692	<i>shall be</i> an abomination;

c11694	Whatsoever

c11697	goeth upon <i>all</i> four,
c11698	or whatsoever
c11699	hath more feet among all creeping things
c11700	that creep upon the earth,
c11701	them ye shall not eat;
c11702	for they <i>are</i> an abomination.
c11703	Ye shall not make yourselves abominable with any creeping thing
c11704	that creepeth,
c11705	neither shall ye make yourselves unclean
c11706	with them, that ye should be defiled thereby.
c11707	For I <i>am</i> the LORD your God:
c11708	ye shall therefore sanctify yourselves,
c11709	and ye shall be holy;
c11710	for I <i>am</i> holy:
c11711	neither shall ye defile yourselves with any manner of creeping thing
c11712	that creepeth upon the earth.
c11713	For I <i>am</i> the LORD
c11714	that bringeth you up out of the land of Egypt,
c11715	to be your God:
c11716	ye shall therefore be holy,
c11717	for I <i>am</i> holy.
c11718	This <i>is</i> the law of the beasts, and of the fowl, and of every living creature
c11719	that moveth in the waters,
c11720	and of every creature
c11721	that creepeth upon the earth:
c11722	To make a difference between the unclean and the clean, and between the beast
c11723	that may be eaten
c11724	and the beast
c11725	that may not be eaten.
c11726	And the LORD spake unto Moses,
c11727	saying,
c11728	Speak unto the children of Israel,
c11729	saying,
c11731	If a woman have conceived seed,
c11732	and born a man child:
c11733	then she shall be unclean seven days;
c11734	according to the days of the separation for her infirmity shall she be unclean.
c11735	And in the eighth day the flesh of his foreskin shall be circumcised.
c11736	And she shall then continue in the blood of her purifying three and thirty days; she shall touch no hallowed thing,
c11738	nor come into the sanctuary,
c11739	until the days of her purifying be fulfilled.
c11740	But if she bear a maid child,
c11741	then she shall be unclean two weeks, as in her separation:
c11742	and she shall continue in the blood of her purifying threescore and six days.
c11744	And when the days of her purifying are fulfilled, for a son, or for a daughter,
c11745	she shall bring a lamb of the first year for a burnt offering, and a young pigeon, or a turtledove, for a sin offering, unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, unto the priest:
c11746	Who shall offer it before the LORD,
c11747	and make an atonement for
c11748	her; and she shall be cleansed from the issue of her blood.
c11749	This <i>is</i> the law
c11750	for her that hath born a male or a female.
c11751	And if she be not able to bring a lamb,
c11752	then she shall bring two turtles, or two young pigeons;
c11753	the one for the burnt offering,
c11754	and the other for a sin offering:
c11755	and the priest shall make an atonement for
c11756	her, and she shall be clean.
c11757	And the LORD spake unto Moses and Aaron,
c11758	saying,
c11760	When a man shall have in the skin of his flesh a rising, a scab, or bright spot, and it be in the skin of his flesh <i>like</i> the plague of leprosy;
c11762	then he shall be brought unto Aaron the priest, or unto one of his sons the priests:
c11763	And the priest shall look on the plague in the skin of the flesh:
c11764	and <i>when</i> the hair in the plague is turned white,
c11765	and the plague in sight <i>be</i> deeper than the skin of his flesh,
c11766	it <i>is</i> a plague of leprosy:
c11767	and the priest shall look on
c11768	him, and pronounce him unclean.
c11769	If the bright spot <i>be</i> white in the skin of his flesh,
c11770	and in sight <i>be</i> not deeper than the skin,
c11771	and the hair thereof be not turned white;
c11772	then the priest shall shut up <i>him that hath</i> the plague seven days:
c11773	And the priest shall look on him the seventh day:
c11774	and, behold, <i>if</i> the plague in his sight be at a stay,
c11775	<i>and</i> the plague spread not in the skin;
c11776	then the priest shall shut him up seven days more:
c11777	And the priest shall look on him again the seventh day:
c11778	and, behold,
c11779	<i>if</i> the plague <i>be</i> somewhat dark,
c11780	<i>and</i> the plague spread not in the skin,
c11781	the priest shall pronounce him clean:
c11782	it <i>is but</i> a scab:
c11783	and he shall wash his clothes,
c11784	and be clean.
c11785	But if the scab spread much abroad in the skin,
c11786	after that he hath been seen of the priest for his cleansing,
c11787	he shall be seen of the priest again:
c11788	And <i>if</i> the priest see
c11789	that, behold,
c11790	the scab spreadeth in the skin,
c11791	then the priest shall pronounce him unclean:
c11792	it <i>is</i> a leprosy.
c11794	When the plague of leprosy is in a man,
c11795	then he shall be brought unto the priest;
c11796	And the priest shall see
c11797	<i>him:</i> and, behold,
c11798	<i>if</i> the rising <i>be</i> white in the skin,
c11799	and it have turned the hair white,
c11800	and <i>there be</i> quick raw flesh in the rising;
c11801	It <i>is</i> an old leprosy in the skin of his flesh,
c11802	and the priest shall pronounce him unclean,
c11803	and shall not shut him up:
c11804	for he <i>is</i> unclean.
c11805	And if a leprosy break out abroad in the skin,
c11806	and the leprosy cover all the skin of <i>him that hath</i> the plague from his head even to his foot, wheresoever the priest looketh;
c11807	Then the priest shall consider:
c11808	and, behold, <i>if</i> the leprosy have covered all his flesh,
c11809	he shall pronounce <i>him</i> clean <i>that hath</i> the plague:
c11810	it is all turned white:
c11811	he <i>is</i> clean.
c11812	But when
c11813	raw flesh appeareth
c11814	in him, he shall be unclean.
c11815	And the priest shall see the raw flesh,
c11816	and pronounce him to be unclean:
c11817	<i>for</i> the raw flesh
c11818	<i>is</i> unclean: it
c11819	<i>is</i> a leprosy.
c11820	Or if the raw flesh turn again,
c11821	and be changed unto white,
c11822	he shall come unto the priest;
c11823	And the priest shall see
c11824	him: and, behold,
c11825	<i>if</i> the plague be turned into white;
c11826	then the priest shall pronounce <i>him</i> clean <i>that hath</i> the plague:
c11827	he <i>is</i> clean.
c11828	The flesh
c11829	also, in which, <i>even</i> in the skin thereof, was a boil,
c11830	and is healed,
c11831	And in the place of the boil there be a white rising, or a bright spot, white, and somewhat reddish,
c11832	and it be shewed to the priest;
c11833	And if, when the priest seeth
c11834	it, behold,
c11835	it <i>be</i> in sight lower than the skin,
c11836	and the hair thereof be turned white;
c11837	the priest shall pronounce him unclean:
c11838	it <i>is</i> a plague of leprosy
c11839	broken out of the boil.
c11840	But if the priest look on
c11841	it, and, behold,
c11842	<i>there be</i> no white hairs
c11843	therein, and <i>if</i> it <i>be</i> not lower than the skin,
c11844	but <i>be</i> somewhat dark;
c11845	then the priest shall shut him up seven days:
c11846	And if it spread much abroad in the skin,
c11847	then the priest shall pronounce him unclean:
c11848	it <i>is</i> a plague.
c11849	But if the bright spot stay in his place,
c11850	<i>and</i> spread not,
c11851	it <i>is</i> a burning boil;
c11852	and the priest shall pronounce him clean.
c11853	Or if there be <i>any</i> flesh,
c11854	in the skin whereof <i>there is</i> a hot burning,
c11855	and the quick <i>flesh</i> that burneth have a white bright spot, somewhat reddish, or white;
c11856	Then the priest shall look upon
c11857	it: and, behold,
c11858	<i>if</i> the hair in the bright spot be turned white,
c11859	and it <i>be in</i> sight deeper than the skin;
c11860	it <i>is</i> a leprosy
c11861	broken out of the burning:
c11862	wherefore the priest shall pronounce him unclean:
c11863	it <i>is</i> the plague of leprosy.
c11864	But if the priest look on
c11865	it, and, behold,
c11866	<i>there be</i> no white hair in the bright spot,
c11867	and it <i>be</i> no lower than the <i>other</i> skin,
c11868	but <i>be</i> somewhat dark;
c11869	then the priest shall shut him up seven days:
c11870	And the priest shall look upon him the seventh day:
c11871	<i>and</i> if it be spread much abroad in the skin,
c11872	then the priest shall pronounce him unclean:
c11873	it <i>is</i> the plague of leprosy.
c11874	And if the bright spot stay in his place,
c11875	<i>and</i> spread not in the skin,
c11876	but it <i>be</i> somewhat dark;
c11877	it <i>is</i> a rising of the burning,
c11878	and the priest shall pronounce him clean:
c11879	for it <i>is</i> an inflammation of the burning.
c11881	If a man or woman have a plague upon the head or the beard;
c11882	Then the priest shall see the plague:
c11883	and, behold,
c11884	if it <i>be</i> in sight deeper than the skin;
c11885	<i>and there be</i> in it a yellow thin hair;
c11886	then the priest shall pronounce him unclean:
c11887	it <i>is</i> a dry scall,
c11888	<i>even</i> a leprosy upon the head or beard.
c11889	And if the priest look on the plague of the scall,
c11890	and, behold,
c11891	it <i>be</i> not in sight deeper than the skin,
c11892	and <i>that there is</i> no black hair
c11893	in it; then the priest shall shut up <i>him that hath</i> the plague of the scall seven days:
c11894	And in the seventh day the priest shall look on the plague:
c11895	and, behold,
c11896	<i>if</i> the scall spread not,
c11897	and there be in it no yellow hair,
c11898	and the scall <i>be</i> not in sight deeper than the skin;
c11899	He shall be shaven,
c11900	but the scall shall he not shave;
c11901	and the priest shall shut up <i>him that hath</i> the scall seven days more:
c11902	And in the seventh day the priest shall look on the scall:
c11903	and, behold,
c11904	<i>if</i> the scall be not spread in the skin,
c11906	nor <i>be</i> in sight deeper than the skin;
c11907	then the priest shall pronounce him clean:
c11908	and he shall wash his clothes,
c11909	and be clean.
c11910	But if the scall spread much in the skin after his cleansing;
c11911	Then the priest shall look on
c11912	him: and, behold,
c11913	if the scall be spread in the skin,
c11914	the priest shall not seek for yellow hair;
c11915	he <i>is</i> unclean.
c11916	But if the scall be in his sight at a stay,
c11917	and <i>that</i> there is black hair grown up
c11918	therein; the scall is healed,
c11919	he <i>is</i> clean:
c11920	and the priest shall pronounce him clean.
c11922	If a man also or a woman have in the skin of their flesh bright spots, <i>even</i> white bright spots;
c11923	Then the priest shall look:
c11924	and, behold,
c11925	<i>if</i> the bright spots in the skin of their flesh <i>be</i> darkish white;
c11926	it <i>is</i> a freckled spot
c11927	<i>that</i> groweth in the skin;
c11928	he <i>is</i> clean.
c11929	And the man
c11930	whose hair is fallen off his head,
c11931	he <i>is</i> bald;
c11932	<i>yet is</i> he clean.
c11933	And he that hath his hair fallen off from the part of his head toward his face,
c11934	he <i>is</i> forehead bald:
c11935	<i>yet is</i> he clean.
c11936	And if there be in the bald head, or bald forehead, a white reddish sore;
c11937	it <i>is</i> a leprosy sprung up in his bald head, or his bald forehead.
c11938	Then the priest shall look upon
c11939	it: and, behold, <i>if</i> the rising of the sore <i>be</i> white reddish in his bald head, or in his bald forehead,
c11940	as the leprosy appeareth in the skin of the flesh;
c11941	He is a leprous man,
c11942	he <i>is</i> unclean:
c11943	the priest shall pronounce him utterly unclean;
c11944	his plague <i>is</i> in his head.
c11945	And the leper
c11946	in whom the plague
c11947	<i>is,</i> his clothes shall be rent,
c11948	and his head bare,
c11949	and he shall put a covering upon his upper lip,
c11951	Unclean, unclean.
c11952	and shall cry,
c11953	All the days
c11954	wherein the plague
c11955	<i>shall be</i> in him he shall be defiled;
c11956	he <i>is</i> unclean:
c11957	he shall dwell alone;
c11958	without the camp <i>shall</i> his habitation <i>be.</i>
c11959	The garment
c11960	also that the plague of leprosy is
c11961	in, <i>whether it be</i> a woollen garment, or a linen garment;
c11962	Whether <i>it be</i> in the warp, or woof; of linen, or of woollen; whether in a skin, or in any thing made of skin;
c11963	And if the plague be greenish or reddish in the garment, or in the skin, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in any thing of skin;
c11964	it <i>is</i> a plague of leprosy,
c11965	and shall be shewed unto the priest:
c11966	And the priest shall look upon the plague,
c11967	and shut up <i>it that hath</i> the plague seven days:
c11968	And he shall look on the plague on the seventh day:
c11969	if the plague be spread in the garment, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in a skin, <i>or</i> in any
c11970	work that is made of skin;
c11971	the plague <i>is</i> a fretting leprosy;
c11972	it <i>is</i> unclean.
c11973	He shall therefore burn that garment, whether warp or woof, in woollen or in linen, or any thing of skin,
c11974	wherein the plague is:
c11975	for it <i>is</i> a fretting leprosy;
c11976	it shall be burnt in the fire.
c11977	And if the priest shall look,
c11978	and, behold,
c11979	the plague be not spread in the garment, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in any thing of skin;
c11980	Then the priest shall command
c11981	that they wash
c11982	<i>the thing</i> wherein the plague
c11983	<i>is,</i> and he shall shut it up seven days more:
c11984	And the priest shall look on
c11985	after that it is washed:
c11986	the plague,
c11987	and, behold,
c11988	<i>if</i> the plague have not changed his colour,
c11989	and the plague be not spread;
c11990	it <i>is</i> unclean;
c11991	thou shalt burn it in the fire;
c11992	it <i>is</i> fret inward, <i>whether</i> it <i>be</i> bare within or without.
c11993	And if the priest look,
c11994	and, behold,
c11995	the plague <i>be</i> somewhat dark
c11996	after the washing
c11997	of it; then he shall rend it out of the garment, or out of the skin, or out of the warp, or out of the woof:
c11998	And if it appear still in the garment, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in any thing of skin;
c11999	it <i>is</i> a spreading
c12000	<i>plague:</i> thou shalt burn that wherein the plague <i>is</i> with fire.
c12002	And the garment, either warp, or woof, or whatsoever thing of skin
c12003	<i>it be,</i> which thou shalt wash,
c12004	if the plague be departed from
c12005	them, then it shall be washed the second time,
c12006	and shall be clean.
c12007	This <i>is</i> the law of the plague of leprosy in a garment of woollen or linen, either in the warp, or woof, or any thing of skins,
c12008	to pronounce it clean,
c12009	or to pronounce it unclean.
c12010	And the LORD spake unto Moses,
c12011	saying,
c12012	This shall be the law of the leper in the day of his cleansing:
c12013	He shall be brought unto the priest:
c12014	And the priest shall go forth out of the camp;
c12015	and the priest shall look,
c12016	and, behold, <i>if</i> the plague of leprosy be healed in the leper;
c12017	Then shall the priest command
c12018	to take for him that is to be cleansed two birds alive <i>and</i> clean, and cedar wood, and scarlet, and hyssop:
c12019	And the priest shall command
c12020	that one of the birds be killed in an earthen vessel over running water:
c12021	As for the living bird,
c12022	he shall take it, and the cedar wood, and the scarlet, and the hyssop,
c12023	and shall dip them and the living bird in the blood of the bird
c12024	<i>that was</i> killed over the running water:
c12025	And he shall sprinkle
c12026	upon him that is to be cleansed from the leprosy
c12027	seven times,
c12028	and shall pronounce him clean,
c12029	and shall let the living bird loose into the open field.
c12030	And he that is to be cleansed shall wash his clothes,
c12031	and shave off all his hair,
c12032	and wash himself in water,
c12033	that he may be clean:
c12034	and after that he shall come into the camp,
c12035	and shall tarry abroad out of his tent seven days.
c12036	But it shall be on the seventh day,
c12037	that he shall shave all his hair off his head and his beard and his eyebrows,
c12038	even all his hair he shall shave off:
c12039	and he shall wash his clothes,
c12040	also he shall wash his flesh in water,
c12041	and he shall be clean.
c12042	And on the eighth day he shall take two he lambs without blemish, and one ewe lamb of the first year without blemish, and three tenth deals of fine flour <i>for</i> a meat offering,
c12043	mingled with oil,
c12044	and one log of oil.
c12045	And the priest that maketh <i>him</i> clean shall present the man that is to be made clean, and those things, before the LORD, <i>at</i> the door of the tabernacle of the congregation:
c12046	And the priest shall take one he lamb,
c12047	and offer him for a trespass offering, and the log of oil,
c12048	and wave them <i>for</i> a wave offering before the LORD:
c12049	And he shall slay the lamb in the place
c12050	where he shall kill the sin offering and the burnt offering,
c12051	in the holy place:
c12052	for as the sin offering <i>is</i> the priest's, <i>so is</i> the trespass offering:
c12053	it
c12054	<i>is</i> most holy:
c12055	And the priest shall take <i>some</i> of the blood of the trespass offering,
c12056	and the priest shall put <i>it</i> upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to be cleansed, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot:
c12057	And the priest shall take <i>some</i> of the log of oil,
c12058	and pour <i>it</i> into the palm of his own left hand:
c12059	And the priest shall dip his right finger in the oil
c12060	that <i>is</i> in his left hand,
c12061	and shall sprinkle of the oil with his finger seven times before the LORD:
c12062	And of the rest of the oil
c12063	that <i>is</i> in his hand
c12064	shall the priest put upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to be cleansed, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot, upon the blood of the trespass offering:
c12066	And the remnant of the oil
c12067	that <i>is</i> in the priest's hand
c12068	he shall pour upon the head of him that is to be cleansed:
c12069	and the priest shall make an atonement for him before the LORD.
c12070	And the priest shall offer the sin offering,
c12071	and make an atonement
c12072	for him that is to be cleansed from his uncleanness;
c12073	and afterward he shall kill the burnt offering:
c12074	And the priest shall offer the burnt offering and the meat offering upon the altar:
c12075	and the priest shall make an atonement for
c12076	him, and he shall be clean.
c12077	And if he <i>be</i> poor,
c12078	and cannot get so much;
c12079	then he shall take one lamb <i>for</i> a trespass offering to be waved,
c12080	to make an atonement for
c12081	him, and one tenth deal of fine flour
c12082	mingled with oil
c12083	for a meat offering,
c12084	and a log of oil;
c12085	And two turtledoves, or two young pigeons,
c12086	such as he is able to get;
c12087	and the one shall be a sin offering,
c12088	and the other a burnt offering.
c12089	And he shall bring them on the eighth day for his cleansing unto the priest, unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, before the LORD.
c12090	And the priest shall take the lamb of the trespass offering, and the log of oil,
c12091	and the priest shall wave them <i>for</i> a wave offering before the LORD:
c12092	And he shall kill the lamb of the trespass offering,
c12093	and the priest shall take <i>some</i> of the blood of the trespass offering,
c12094	and put <i>it</i> upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to be cleansed, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot:
c12095	And the priest shall pour of the oil into the palm of his own left hand:
c12096	And the priest shall sprinkle with his right finger <i>some</i> of the oil
c12097	that <i>is</i> in his left hand
c12098	seven times before the LORD:
c12099	And the priest shall put of the oil
c12100	that <i>is</i> in his hand
c12101	upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to be cleansed, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot, upon the place of the blood of the trespass offering:
c12103	And the rest of the oil
c12104	that <i>is</i> in the priest's hand
c12105	he shall put upon the head of him that is to be cleansed,
c12106	to make an atonement for him before the LORD.
c12107	And he shall offer the one of the turtledoves, or of the young pigeons,
c12108	such as he can get;
c12109	<i>Even</i> such as he is able to get,
c12110	the one <i>for</i> a sin offering,
c12111	and the other <i>for</i> a burnt offering, with the meat offering:
c12112	and the priest shall make an atonement for him that is to be cleansed before the LORD.
c12113	This <i>is</i> the law
c12114	<i>of him</i> in whom <i>is</i> the plague of leprosy,
c12115	whose hand is not able to get <i>that which pertaineth</i> to his cleansing.
c12116	And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron,
c12117	saying,
c12118	When ye be come into the land of Canaan,
c12119	which I give to you for a possession,
c12120	and I put the plague of leprosy in a house of the land of your possession;
c12121	shall come
c12122	And he that owneth the house
c12123	and tell the priest,
c12124	saying,
c12125	It seemeth to me <i>there is</i> as it were a plague in the house:
c12126	Then the priest shall command
c12127	that they empty the house,
c12128	before the priest go
c12129	<i>into it</i> to see the plague,
c12130	that all that <i>is</i> in the house be not made unclean:
c12132	and afterward the priest shall go in
c12133	to see the house:
c12134	And he shall look on the plague,
c12135	and, behold, <i>if</i> the plague <i>be</i> in the walls of the house with hollow strakes, greenish or reddish,
c12136	which in sight <i>are</i> lower than the wall;
c12137	Then the priest shall go out of the house to the door of the house,
c12138	and shut up the house seven days:
c12139	And the priest shall come again the seventh day,
c12140	and shall look:
c12141	and, behold, <i>if</i> the plague be spread in the walls of the house;
c12142	Then the priest shall command
c12143	that they take away the stones
c12144	in which the plague
c12145	<i>is,</i> and they shall cast them into an unclean place without the city:
c12146	And he shall cause the house to be scraped within round about,
c12147	and they shall pour out the dust
c12148	that they scrape off
c12149	without the city into an unclean place:
c12150	And they shall take other stones,
c12151	and put <i>them</i> in the place of those stones;
c12152	and he shall take other morter,
c12153	and shall plaister the house.
c12154	And if the plague come again,
c12155	and break out in the house,
c12156	after that he hath taken away the stones,
c12157	and after he hath scraped the house,
c12158	and after it is plaistered;
c12159	Then the priest shall come
c12160	and look,
c12161	and, behold, <i>if</i> the plague be spread in the house,
c12162	it <i>is</i> a fretting leprosy in the house:
c12163	it <i>is</i> unclean.
c12164	And he shall break down the house, the stones of it, and the timber thereof, and all the morter of the house;
c12165	and he shall carry <i>them</i> forth out of the city into an unclean place.
c12167	Moreover he that goeth into the house all the while
c12168	that it is shut up
c12169	shall be unclean until the even.
c12171	And he that lieth in the house
c12172	shall wash his clothes;
c12174	and he that eateth in the house
c12175	shall wash his clothes.
c12176	And if the priest shall come in,
c12177	and look
c12178	<i>upon it,</i> and, behold, the plague hath not spread in the house,
c12179	after the house was plaistered:
c12180	then the priest shall pronounce the house clean,
c12181	because the plague is healed.
c12182	And he shall take
c12183	to cleanse the house
c12184	two birds, and cedar wood, and scarlet, and hyssop:
c12185	And he shall kill the one of the birds in an earthen vessel over running water:
c12186	And he shall take the cedar wood, and the hyssop, and the scarlet, and the living bird,
c12187	and dip them in the blood of the slain bird, and in the running water,
c12188	and sprinkle the house seven times:
c12189	And he shall cleanse the house with the blood of the bird, and with the running water, and with the living bird, and with the cedar wood, and with the hyssop, and with the scarlet:
c12190	But he shall let go the living bird out of the city into the open fields,
c12191	and make an atonement for the house:
c12192	and it shall be clean.
c12193	This <i>is</i> the law for all manner of plague of leprosy, and scall,
c12194	And for the leprosy of a garment, and of a house,
c12195	And for a rising, and for a scab, and for a bright spot:
c12196	To teach when <i>it is</i> unclean, and when <i>it is</i> clean:
c12197	this <i>is</i> the law of leprosy.
c12198	And the LORD spake unto Moses and to Aaron,
c12199	saying,
c12200	Speak unto the children of Israel,
c12201	and say unto
c12203	them, When any man hath a running issue out of his flesh, <i>because of</i> his issue
c12204	he <i>is</i> unclean.
c12205	And this shall be his uncleanness in his issue:
c12206	whether his flesh run with his issue,
c12207	or his flesh be stopped from his issue,
c12208	it <i>is</i> his uncleanness.
c12209	Every bed,
c12210	whereon he lieth that hath the issue,
c12211	is unclean:
c12212	and every thing,
c12213	whereon he sitteth,
c12214	shall be unclean.
c12215	And whosoever
c12216	toucheth his bed
c12217	shall wash his clothes,
c12218	and bathe <i>himself</i> in water,
c12219	and be unclean until the even.
c12221	And he that sitteth on <i>any</i> thing
c12222	whereon he sat that hath the issue
c12223	shall wash his clothes,
c12224	and bathe <i>himself</i> in water,
c12225	and be unclean until the even.
c12227	And he that toucheth the flesh of him that hath the issue
c12228	shall wash his clothes,
c12229	and bathe <i>himself</i> in water,
c12230	and be unclean until the even.
c12231	And if he that hath the issue spit upon him that is clean;
c12232	then he shall wash his clothes,
c12233	and bathe <i>himself</i> in water,
c12234	and be unclean until the even.
c12235	And what saddle soever
c12236	he rideth upon that hath the issue
c12237	shall be unclean.
c12238	And whosoever
c12239	toucheth any thing
c12240	that was under
c12241	him shall be unclean until the even:
c12243	and he that beareth
c12244	<i>any of</i> those things shall wash his clothes,
c12245	and bathe <i>himself</i> in water,
c12246	and be unclean until the even.
c12247	And whomsoever
c12248	he toucheth that hath the issue,
c12249	and hath not rinsed his hands in water,
c12250	he shall wash his clothes,
c12251	and bathe <i>himself</i> in water,
c12252	and be unclean until the even.
c12253	And the vessel of earth,
c12254	that he toucheth which hath the issue,
c12255	shall be broken:
c12256	and every vessel of wood shall be rinsed in water.
c12257	And when he that hath an issue is cleansed of his issue;
c12258	then he shall number to himself seven days for his cleansing,
c12259	and wash his clothes,
c12260	and bathe his flesh in running water,
c12261	and shall be clean.
c12262	And on the eighth day he shall take to him two turtledoves, or two young pigeons,
c12263	and come before the LORD unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation,
c12264	and give them unto the priest:
c12265	And the priest shall offer
c12266	them, the one <i>for</i> a sin offering,
c12267	and the other <i>for</i> a burnt offering;
c12268	and the priest shall make an atonement for him before the LORD for his issue.
c12270	And if any man's seed of copulation go out from
c12271	him, then he shall wash all his flesh in water,
c12272	and be unclean until the even.
c12273	And every garment, and every skin,
c12274	whereon is the seed of copulation,
c12275	shall be washed with water,
c12276	and be unclean until the even.
c12277	The woman
c12278	also with whom man shall lie <i>with</i> seed of copulation,
c12279	they shall <i>both</i> bathe <i>themselves</i> in water,
c12280	and be unclean until the even.
c12282	And if a woman have an issue, <i>and</i> her issue in her flesh be blood,
c12284	she shall be put apart seven days:
c12285	and whosoever
c12286	toucheth
c12287	her shall be unclean until the even.
c12288	And every thing
c12289	that she lieth upon in her separation
c12290	shall be unclean:
c12291	every thing
c12292	also that she sitteth upon
c12293	shall be unclean.
c12294	And whosoever
c12295	toucheth her bed
c12296	shall wash his clothes,
c12297	and bathe <i>himself</i> in water,
c12298	and be unclean until the even.
c12299	And whosoever

c12301	that she sat upon
c12302	shall wash his clothes,
c12303	and bathe <i>himself</i> in water,
c12304	and be unclean until the even.
c12305	And if it <i>be</i> on <i>her</i> bed,
c12306	or on any thing
c12307	whereon she sitteth,
c12308	when he toucheth
c12309	it, he shall be unclean until the even.
c12310	And if any man lie with her at all,
c12311	and her flowers be upon
c12312	him, he shall be unclean seven days;
c12313	and all the bed
c12314	whereon he lieth
c12315	shall be unclean.
c12317	And if a woman have an issue of her blood many days out of the time of her separation,
c12318	or if it run beyond the time of her separation;
c12319	all the days of the issue of her uncleanness shall be as the days of her separation:
c12320	she <i>shall be</i> unclean.
c12321	Every bed
c12322	whereon she lieth all the days of her issue
c12323	shall be unto her as the bed of her separation:
c12324	and whatsoever
c12325	she sitteth upon
c12326	shall be unclean, as the uncleanness of her separation.
c12327	And whosoever
c12328	toucheth
c12329	those things shall be unclean,
c12330	and shall wash his clothes,
c12331	and bathe <i>himself</i> in water,
c12332	and be unclean until the even.
c12333	But if she be cleansed of her issue,
c12334	then she shall number to herself seven days,
c12335	and after that she shall be clean.
c12336	And on the eighth day she shall take unto her two turtles, or two young pigeons,
c12337	and bring them unto the priest, to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.
c12338	And the priest shall offer the one <i>for</i> a sin offering,
c12339	and the other <i>for</i> a burnt offering;
c12340	and the priest shall make an atonement for her before the LORD for the issue of her uncleanness.
c12341	Thus shall ye separate the children of Israel from their uncleanness;
c12342	that they die not in their uncleanness,
c12343	when they defile my tabernacle
c12344	that <i>is</i> among them.
c12345	This <i>is</i> the law of him that hath an issue,
c12346	and <i>of him</i> whose seed goeth from
c12347	him, and is defiled therewith;
c12348	And of her that is sick of her flowers,
c12349	and of him that hath an issue, of the man, and of the woman,
c12350	and of him
c12351	that lieth with her that is unclean.
c12352	And the LORD spake unto Moses after the death of the two sons of Aaron,
c12353	when they offered before the LORD,
c12354	and died;
c12355	And the LORD said unto Moses,
c12356	Speak unto Aaron thy brother,
c12357	that he come not at all times into the holy <i>place</i> within the vail before the mercy seat,
c12358	which <i>is</i> upon the ark;
c12359	that he die not:
c12360	for I will appear in the cloud upon the mercy seat.
c12361	Thus shall Aaron come into the holy
c12362	<i>place:</i> with a young bullock for a sin offering,
c12363	and a ram for a burnt offering.
c12364	He shall put on the holy linen coat,
c12365	and he shall have the linen breeches upon his flesh,
c12366	and shall be girded with a linen girdle,
c12367	and with the linen mitre shall he be attired:
c12368	these <i>are</i> holy garments;
c12369	therefore shall he wash his flesh in water,
c12370	and <i>so</i> put them on.
c12371	And he shall take of the congregation of the children of Israel two kids of the goats for a sin offering, and one ram for a burnt offering.
c12372	And Aaron shall offer his bullock of the sin offering,
c12373	which
c12374	<i>is</i> for himself, and make an atonement for himself, and for his house.
c12375	And he shall take the two goats,
c12376	and present them before the LORD <i>at</i> the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.
c12377	And Aaron shall cast lots upon the two goats;
c12378	one lot for the LORD,
c12379	and the other lot for the scapegoat.
c12380	And Aaron shall bring the goat
c12381	upon which the LORD'S lot fell,
c12382	and offer him <i>for</i> a sin offering.
c12383	But the goat,
c12384	on which the lot fell to be the scapegoat,
c12385	shall be presented alive before the LORD,
c12386	to make an atonement with
c12387	him, <i>and</i> to let him go for a scapegoat into the wilderness.
c12388	And Aaron shall bring the bullock of the sin offering,
c12389	which
c12390	<i>is</i> for himself, and shall make an atonement for himself, and for his house,
c12391	and shall kill the bullock of the sin offering
c12392	which <i>is</i> for himself:
c12393	And he shall take a censer full of burning coals of fire from off the altar before the LORD,
c12394	and his hands full of sweet incense beaten small,
c12395	and bring <i>it</i> within the vail:
c12396	And he shall put the incense upon the fire before the LORD,
c12397	that the cloud of the incense may cover the mercy seat
c12398	that <i>is</i> upon the testimony,
c12399	that he die not:
c12400	And he shall take of the blood of the bullock,
c12401	and sprinkle <i>it</i> with his finger upon the mercy seat eastward;
c12402	and before the mercy seat shall he sprinkle of the blood with his finger seven times.
c12403	Then shall he kill the goat of the sin offering,
c12404	that <i>is</i> for the people,
c12405	and bring his blood within the vail,
c12406	and do with that blood
c12407	as he did with the blood of the bullock,
c12408	and sprinkle it upon the mercy seat,
c12409	and before the mercy seat:
c12410	And he shall make an atonement for the holy <i>place,</i> because of the uncleanness of the children of Israel, and because of their transgressions in all their sins:
c12411	and so shall he do for the tabernacle of the congregation,
c12412	that remaineth among them in the midst of their uncleanness.
c12413	And there shall be no man in the tabernacle of the congregation
c12414	when he goeth in
c12415	to make an atonement
c12416	in the holy
c12417	<i>place,</i> until he come out,
c12418	and have made an atonement for himself, and for his household, and for all the congregation of Israel.
c12419	And he shall go out unto the altar
c12420	that <i>is</i> before the LORD,
c12421	and make an atonement for
c12422	it; and shall take of the blood of the bullock, and of the blood of the goat,
c12423	and put <i>it</i> upon the horns of the altar round about.
c12424	And he shall sprinkle of the blood upon it with his finger seven times,
c12425	and cleanse
c12426	it, and hallow it from the uncleanness of the children of Israel.
c12427	And when he hath made an end
c12428	of reconciling the holy <i>place,</i> and the tabernacle of the congregation, and the altar,
c12429	he shall bring the live goat:
c12430	And Aaron shall lay both his hands upon the head of the live goat,
c12431	and confess over him all the iniquities of the children of Israel, and all their transgressions in all their sins,
c12432	putting them upon the head of the goat,
c12433	and shall send <i>him</i> away by the hand of a fit man into the wilderness:
c12434	And the goat shall bear upon him all their iniquities unto a land not inhabited:
c12435	and he shall let go the goat in the wilderness.
c12436	And Aaron shall come into the tabernacle of the congregation,
c12437	and shall put off the linen garments,
c12438	which he put on
c12439	when he went into the holy
c12440	<i>place,</i> and shall leave them there:
c12441	And he shall wash his flesh with water in the holy place,
c12442	and put on his garments,
c12443	and come forth,
c12444	and offer his burnt offering, and the burnt offering of the people,
c12445	and make an atonement for himself, and for the people.
c12446	And the fat of the sin offering shall he burn upon the altar.
c12448	And he that let go the goat for the scapegoat
c12449	shall wash his clothes,
c12450	and bathe his flesh in water,
c12451	and afterward come into the camp.
c12452	And the bullock <i>for</i> the sin offering, and the goat <i>for</i> the sin offering,
c12453	whose blood was brought in
c12454	to make atonement in the holy
c12455	<i>place,</i> shall <i>one</i> carry forth without the camp;
c12456	and they shall burn in the fire their skins, and their flesh, and their dung.
c12458	And he that burneth
c12459	them shall wash his clothes,
c12460	and bathe his flesh in water,
c12461	and afterward he shall come into the camp.
c12462	And <i>this</i> shall be a statute for ever
c12463	unto you: <i>that</i> in the seventh month, on the tenth <i>day</i> of the month, ye shall afflict your souls,
c12464	and do no work at all, <i>whether it be</i> one of your own country, or a stranger
c12465	that sojourneth among you:
c12466	For on that day shall <i>the priest</i> make an atonement for
c12467	you, to cleanse
c12468	you, <i>that</i> ye may be clean from all your sins before the LORD.
c12469	It <i>shall be</i> a sabbath of rest
c12470	unto you, and ye shall afflict your souls,
c12471	by a statute for ever.
c12472	And the priest, whom he shall anoint,
c12474	and whom he shall consecrate
c12475	to minister in the priest's office in his father's stead, shall make the atonement,
c12476	and shall put on the linen clothes, <i>even</i> the holy garments:
c12477	And he shall make an atonement for the holy sanctuary,
c12478	and he shall make an atonement for the tabernacle of the congregation, and for the altar,
c12479	and he shall make an atonement for the priests, and for all the people of the congregation.
c12480	And this shall be an everlasting statute
c12481	unto you, to make an atonement for the children of Israel for all their sins once a year.
c12482	And he did
c12483	as the LORD commanded Moses.
c12484	And the LORD spake unto Moses,
c12485	saying,
c12486	Speak unto Aaron, and unto his sons, and unto all the children of Israel,
c12487	and say unto
c12488	them; This <i>is</i> the thing
c12489	which the LORD hath commanded,
c12490	saying,
c12491	What man soever <i>there be</i> of the house of Israel,
c12492	that killeth an ox, or lamb, or goat, in the camp,
c12493	or that killeth <i>it</i> out of the camp,
c12494	And bringeth it not unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation,
c12495	to offer an offering unto the LORD before the tabernacle of the LORD;
c12496	blood shall be imputed unto that man;
c12497	he hath shed blood;
c12498	and that man shall be cut off from among his people:
c12499	To the end that the children of Israel may bring their sacrifices,
c12500	which they offer in the open field,
c12501	even that they may bring them unto the LORD, unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, unto the priest,
c12502	and offer them <i>for</i> peace offerings unto the LORD.
c12503	And the priest shall sprinkle the blood upon the altar of the LORD <i>at</i> the door of the tabernacle of the congregation,
c12504	and burn the fat for a sweet savour unto the LORD.
c12505	And they shall no more offer their sacrifices unto devils,
c12506	after whom they have gone a whoring.
c12507	This shall be a statute for ever unto them throughout their generations.
c12508	And thou shalt say unto
c12509	them, Whatsoever man <i>there be</i> of the house of Israel, or of the strangers
c12510	which sojourn among
c12511	you, that offereth a burnt offering or sacrifice,
c12512	And bringeth it not unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation,
c12513	to offer it unto the LORD;
c12514	even that man shall be cut off from among his people.
c12515	And whatsoever man <i>there be</i> of the house of Israel, or of the strangers
c12516	that sojourn among
c12517	you, that eateth any manner of blood;
c12518	I will even set my face against that soul
c12519	that eateth blood,
c12520	and will cut him off from among his people.
c12521	For the life of the flesh
c12522	<i>is</i> in the blood: and I have given it to you upon the altar
c12524	to make an atonement for your souls:
c12525	for it <i>is</i> the blood
c12526	<i>that</i> maketh an atonement for the soul.
c12527	Therefore I said unto the children of Israel,
c12528	No soul of you shall eat blood,
c12530	that sojourneth among you eat blood.
c12531	neither shall any stranger
c12532	And whatsoever man <i>there be</i> of the children of Israel, or of the strangers
c12533	that sojourn among
c12534	you, which hunteth and catcheth any beast or fowl
c12535	that may be eaten;
c12536	he shall even pour out the blood
c12537	thereof, and cover it with dust.
c12538	For <i>it is</i> the life of all flesh;
c12539	the blood
c12540	of it <i>is</i> for the life
c12541	thereof: therefore I said unto the children of Israel,
c12542	Ye shall eat the blood of no manner of flesh:
c12543	for the life of all flesh
c12544	<i>is</i> the blood
c12545	thereof: whosoever
c12546	eateth
c12547	it shall be cut off.
c12548	And every soul
c12549	that eateth that which died <i>of itself,</i> or that which was torn
c12550	<i>with beasts, whether it be</i> one of your own country, or a stranger,
c12551	he shall both wash his clothes,
c12552	and bathe <i>himself</i> in water,
c12553	and be unclean until the even:
c12554	then shall he be clean.
c12555	But if he wash <i>them</i> not,
c12556	nor bathe his flesh;
c12557	then he shall bear his iniquity.
c12558	And the LORD spake unto Moses,
c12559	saying,
c12560	Speak unto the children of Israel,
c12561	and say unto
c12562	them, I am the LORD your God.
c12563	After the doings of the land of Egypt,
c12564	wherein ye dwelt,
c12565	shall ye not do:
c12566	and after the doings of the land of Canaan,
c12567	whither I bring
c12568	you, shall ye not do:
c12569	neither shall ye walk in their ordinances.
c12570	Ye shall do my judgments,
c12571	and keep mine ordinances,
c12572	to walk
c12573	therein: I <i>am</i> the LORD your God.
c12574	Ye shall therefore keep my statutes, and my judgments:
c12575	which if a man do,
c12576	he shall live
c12577	in them: I <i>am</i> the LORD.
c12579	None of you shall approach to any that is near of kin
c12580	to him, to uncover <i>their</i> nakedness:
c12581	I <i>am</i> the LORD.
c12582	The nakedness of thy father, or the nakedness of thy mother, shalt thou not uncover:
c12583	she <i>is</i> thy mother;
c12584	thou shalt not uncover her nakedness.
c12585	The nakedness of thy father's wife shalt thou not uncover:
c12586	it <i>is</i> thy father's nakedness.
c12587	The nakedness of thy sister, the daughter of thy father, or daughter of thy mother, <i>whether she be</i> born at home, or born abroad,
c12588	<i>even</i> their nakedness thou shalt not uncover.
c12589	The nakedness of thy son's daughter, or of thy daughter's daughter,
c12590	<i>even</i> their nakedness thou shalt not uncover:
c12591	for theirs <i>is</i> thine own nakedness.
c12592	The nakedness of thy father's wife's daughter, begotten of thy father,
c12593	she <i>is</i> thy sister,
c12594	thou shalt not uncover her nakedness.
c12595	Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy father's sister:
c12596	she <i>is</i> thy father's near kinswoman.
c12597	Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy mother's sister:
c12598	for she <i>is</i> thy mother's near kinswoman.
c12599	Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy father's brother,
c12600	thou shalt not approach to his wife:
c12601	she <i>is</i> thine aunt.
c12602	Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy daughter in law:
c12603	she <i>is</i> thy son's wife;
c12604	thou shalt not uncover her nakedness.
c12605	Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy brother's wife:
c12606	it <i>is</i> thy brother's nakedness.
c12607	Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of a woman and her daughter,
c12608	neither shalt thou take her son's daughter, or her daughter's daughter,
c12609	to uncover her nakedness;
c12610	<i>for</i> they <i>are</i> her near kinswomen:
c12611	it <i>is</i> wickedness.
c12612	Neither shalt thou take a wife to her sister,
c12613	to vex
c12614	<i>her,</i> to uncover her nakedness, beside the other in her life <i>time.</i>
c12615	Also thou shalt not approach unto a woman to uncover her nakedness, as long as she is put apart for her uncleanness.
c12617	Moreover thou shalt not lie carnally with thy neighbour's wife,
c12618	to defile thyself with her.
c12619	And thou shalt not let any of thy seed
c12620	pass through <i>the fire</i> to Molech,
c12621	neither shalt thou profane the name of thy God:
c12622	I <i>am</i> the LORD.
c12623	Thou shalt not lie with mankind, as with womankind:
c12624	it <i>is</i> abomination.
c12625	Neither shalt thou lie with any beast
c12626	to defile
c12627	thyself therewith: neither shall any woman stand before a beast
c12628	to lie down
c12629	thereto: it <i>is</i> confusion.
c12630	Defile not ye yourselves in any of these things:
c12631	for in all these the nations are defiled
c12632	which I cast out before you:
c12633	And the land is defiled:
c12634	therefore I do visit the iniquity thereof upon
c12635	it, and the land itself vomiteth out her inhabitants.
c12636	Ye shall therefore keep my statutes and my judgments,
c12637	and shall not commit <i>any</i> of these abominations; <i>neither</i> any of your own nation, nor any stranger
c12638	that sojourneth among you:
c12639	(For all these abominations have the men of the land done,
c12640	which <i>were</i> before
c12641	you, and the land is defiled;)
c12642	That the land spue not you out
c12643	also, when ye defile
c12644	it, as it spued out the nations
c12645	that <i>were</i> before you.
c12646	For whosoever
c12647	shall commit any of these abominations,
c12648	even the souls that commit <i>them</i> shall be cut off
c12650	from among their people.
c12651	Therefore shall ye keep mine ordinance,
c12652	that <i>ye</i> commit not <i>any one</i> of these abominable customs,
c12653	which were committed before
c12654	you, and that ye defile not yourselves
c12655	therein: I <i>am</i> the LORD your God.
c12656	And the LORD spake unto Moses,
c12657	saying,
c12658	Speak unto all the congregation of the children of Israel,
c12659	and say unto
c12660	them, Ye shall be holy:
c12661	for I the LORD your God <i>am</i> holy.
c12663	Ye shall fear every man his mother, and his father,
c12664	and keep my sabbaths:
c12665	I <i>am</i> the LORD your God.
c12666	Turn ye not unto idols,
c12667	nor make to yourselves molten gods:
c12668	I <i>am</i> the LORD your God.
c12669	And if ye offer a sacrifice of peace offerings unto the LORD,
c12670	ye shall offer it at your own will.
c12671	It shall be eaten the same day ye offer
c12672	it, and on the morrow:
c12674	and if ought remain until the third day,
c12675	it shall be burnt in the fire.
c12676	And if it be eaten at all on the third day,
c12677	it <i>is</i> abominable;
c12678	it shall not be accepted.
c12680	Therefore <i>every one</i> that eateth
c12681	it shall bear his iniquity,
c12682	because he hath profaned the hallowed thing of the LORD:
c12683	and that soul shall be cut off from among his people.
c12685	And when ye reap the harvest of your land,
c12686	thou shalt not wholly reap the corners of thy field,
c12688	neither shalt thou gather the gleanings of thy harvest.
c12689	And thou shalt not glean thy vineyard,
c12690	neither shalt thou gather <i>every</i> grape of thy vineyard;
c12691	thou shalt leave them for the poor and stranger:
c12692	I <i>am</i> the LORD your God.
c12693	Ye shall not steal,
c12694	neither deal falsely,
c12695	neither lie
c12696	one to another.
c12697	And ye shall not swear by my name falsely,
c12698	neither shalt thou profane the name of thy God:
c12699	I <i>am</i> the LORD.
c12700	Thou shalt not defraud thy neighbour,
c12701	neither rob
c12702	<i>him:</i> the wages of him that is hired shall not abide with thee all night until the morning.
c12703	Thou shalt not curse the deaf,
c12704	nor put a stumblingblock before the blind,
c12705	but shalt fear thy God:
c12706	I <i>am</i> the LORD.
c12707	Ye shall do no unrighteousness in judgment:
c12708	thou shalt not respect the person of the poor,
c12709	nor honour the person of the mighty:
c12710	<i>but</i> in righteousness shalt thou judge thy neighbour.
c12711	Thou shalt not go up and down <i>as</i> a talebearer among thy people:
c12712	neither shalt thou stand against the blood of thy neighbour:
c12713	I <i>am</i> the LORD.
c12714	Thou shalt not hate thy brother in thine heart:
c12715	thou shalt in any wise rebuke thy neighbour,
c12716	and not suffer sin upon him.
c12717	Thou shalt not avenge,
c12718	nor bear any grudge against the children of thy people,
c12719	but thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself:
c12720	I <i>am</i> the LORD.
c12721	Ye shall keep my statutes.
c12722	Thou shalt not let thy cattle gender with a diverse kind:
c12723	thou shalt not sow thy field with mingled seed:
c12724	neither shall a garment mingled of linen and woollen come upon thee.
c12725	And whosoever
c12726	lieth carnally with a woman,
c12727	that <i>is</i> a bondmaid,
c12728	betrothed to an husband,
c12729	and not at all redeemed,
c12730	nor freedom given
c12731	her; she shall be scourged;
c12732	they shall not be put to death,
c12733	because she was not free.
c12734	And he shall bring his trespass offering unto the LORD, unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, <i>even</i> a ram for a trespass offering.
c12735	And the priest shall make an atonement for him with the ram of the trespass offering before the LORD for his sin
c12736	which he hath done:
c12737	and the sin which he hath done shall be forgiven him.
c12739	And when ye shall come into the land,
c12740	and shall have planted all manner of trees for food,
c12741	then ye shall count the fruit thereof as uncircumcised: three years shall it be as uncircumcised
c12743	unto you: it shall not be eaten of.
c12744	But in the fourth year all the fruit thereof shall be holy
c12745	to praise the LORD <i>withal.</i>
c12746	And in the fifth year shall ye eat of the fruit
c12747	thereof, that it may yield unto you the increase
c12748	thereof: I <i>am</i> the LORD your God.
c12749	Ye shall not eat <i>any thing</i> with the blood:
c12750	neither shall ye use enchantment, nor observe times.
c12752	Ye shall not round the corners of your heads,
c12753	neither shalt thou mar the corners of thy beard.
c12754	Ye shall not make any cuttings in your flesh for the dead,
c12755	nor print any marks
c12756	upon you: I <i>am</i> the LORD.
c12757	Do not prostitute thy daughter,
c12758	to cause her to be a whore;
c12759	lest the land fall to whoredom,
c12760	and the land become full of wickedness.
c12761	Ye shall keep my sabbaths,
c12762	and reverence my sanctuary:
c12763	I <i>am</i> the LORD.
c12764	Regard not them that have familiar spirits, neither seek after
c12765	wizards,
c12766	to be defiled
c12767	by them: I <i>am</i> the LORD your God.
c12768	Thou shalt rise up before the hoary head,
c12769	and honour the face of the old man,
c12770	and fear thy God:
c12771	I <i>am</i> the LORD.
c12772	And if a stranger sojourn with thee in your land,
c12773	ye shall not vex him.
c12774	<i>But</i> the stranger that dwelleth with you shall be unto you as one born among
c12776	you, and thou shalt love him as thyself;
c12777	for ye were strangers in the land of Egypt:
c12778	I <i>am</i> the LORD your God.
c12779	Ye shall do no unrighteousness in judgment, in meteyard, in weight, or in measure.
c12780	Just balances, just weights, a just ephah, and a just hin, shall ye have:
c12781	I <i>am</i> the LORD your God,
c12782	which brought you out of the land of Egypt.
c12783	Therefore shall ye observe all my statutes, and all my judgments,
c12784	and do
c12785	them: I <i>am</i> the LORD.
c12786	And the LORD spake unto Moses,
c12787	saying,
c12788	Again, thou shalt say to the children of Israel,
c12789	Whosoever <i>he be</i> of the children of Israel, or of the strangers
c12790	that sojourn in Israel,
c12791	that giveth <i>any</i> of his seed unto Molech;
c12792	he shall surely be put to death:
c12793	the people of the land shall stone him with stones.
c12794	And I will set my face against that man,
c12795	and will cut him off from among his people;
c12796	because he hath given of his seed unto Molech,
c12797	to defile my sanctuary,
c12798	and to profane my holy name.
c12799	And if the people of the land do any ways hide their eyes from the man,
c12800	when he giveth of his seed unto Molech,
c12801	and kill him not:
c12802	Then I will set my face against that man, and against his family,
c12803	and will cut him off, and all
c12804	that go a whoring after
c12805	him, to commit whoredom with Molech,
c12806	from among their people.
c12807	And the soul
c12808	that turneth after such as have familiar spirits, and after wizards,
c12809	to go a whoring after
c12810	them, I will even set my face against that soul,
c12811	and will cut him off from among his people.
c12812	Sanctify yourselves
c12813	therefore, and be ye holy:
c12814	for I <i>am</i> the LORD your God.
c12815	And ye shall keep my statutes,
c12816	and do
c12817	them: I <i>am</i> the LORD
c12818	which sanctify you.
c12819	For every one
c12820	that curseth his father or his mother
c12821	shall be surely put to death:
c12822	he hath cursed his father or his mother;
c12823	his blood <i>shall be</i> upon him.
c12824	And the man
c12825	that committeth adultery with <i>another</i> man's wife,
c12826	<i>even he</i> that committeth adultery with his neighbour's wife,
c12827	the adulterer and the adulteress shall surely be put to death.
c12828	And the man
c12829	that lieth with his father's wife
c12830	hath uncovered his father's nakedness:
c12831	both of them shall surely be put to death;
c12832	their blood <i>shall be</i> upon them.
c12834	And if a man lie with his daughter in law,
c12835	both of them shall surely be put to death:
c12836	they have wrought confusion;
c12837	their blood <i>shall be</i> upon them.
c12839	If a man also lie with mankind, as he lieth with a woman,
c12840	both of them have committed an abomination:
c12841	they shall surely be put to death;
c12842	their blood <i>shall be</i> upon them.
c12844	And if a man take a wife and her mother,
c12845	it <i>is</i> wickedness:
c12846	they shall be burnt with fire,
c12847	both he and they; that there be no wickedness among you.
c12849	And if a man lie with a beast,
c12850	he shall surely be put to death:
c12851	and ye shall slay the beast.
c12853	And if a woman approach unto any beast,
c12854	and lie down
c12855	thereto, thou shalt kill the woman, and the beast:
c12856	they shall surely be put to death;
c12857	their blood <i>shall be</i> upon them.
c12859	And if a man shall take his sister, his father's daughter, or his mother's daughter,
c12860	and see her nakedness,
c12861	and she see his nakedness;
c12862	it <i>is</i> a wicked thing;
c12863	and they shall be cut off in the sight of their people:
c12864	he hath uncovered his sister's nakedness;
c12865	he shall bear his iniquity.
c12867	And if a man shall lie with a woman having her sickness,
c12868	and shall uncover her nakedness;
c12869	he hath discovered her fountain,
c12870	and she hath uncovered the fountain of her blood:
c12871	and both of them shall be cut off from among their people.
c12872	And thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy mother's sister, nor of thy father's sister:
c12873	for he uncovereth his near kin:
c12874	they shall bear their iniquity.
c12876	And if a man shall lie with his uncle's wife,
c12877	he hath uncovered his uncle's nakedness:
c12878	they shall bear their sin;
c12879	they shall die childless.
c12881	And if a man shall take his brother's wife,
c12882	it <i>is</i> an unclean thing:
c12883	he hath uncovered his brother's nakedness;
c12884	they shall be childless.
c12885	Ye shall therefore keep all my statutes, and all my judgments,
c12886	and do
c12887	them: that the land, whither I bring
c12889	you to dwell therein, spue you not out.
c12890	And ye shall not walk in the manners of the nation,
c12891	which I cast out before
c12892	you: for they committed all these things,
c12893	and therefore I abhorred them.
c12894	But I have said
c12895	unto you, Ye shall inherit their land,
c12896	and I will give
c12897	it unto you to possess it, a land that floweth with milk and honey:
c12898	I <i>am</i> the LORD your God,
c12899	which have separated you from <i>other</i> people.
c12900	Ye shall therefore put difference between clean beasts and unclean,
c12901	and between unclean fowls and clean:
c12902	and ye shall not make your souls abominable by beast, or by fowl, or by any manner
c12903	of living thing that creepeth on the ground,
c12904	which I have separated
c12905	from you as unclean.
c12906	And ye shall be holy
c12907	unto me: for I the LORD <i>am</i> holy,
c12908	and have severed you from <i>other</i> people,
c12909	that ye should be mine.
c12910	A man also or woman
c12911	that hath a familiar spirit, or that is a wizard,
c12912	shall surely be put to death:
c12913	they shall stone them with stones:
c12914	their blood <i>shall be</i> upon them.
c12915	And the LORD said unto Moses,
c12916	Speak unto the priests the sons of Aaron,
c12917	and say unto
c12918	them, There shall none be defiled for the dead among his people:
c12919	But for his kin,
c12920	that is near unto
c12921	him, <i>that is,</i> for his mother, and for his father, and for his son, and for his daughter, and for his brother,
c12922	And for his sister a virgin,
c12923	that is nigh unto
c12924	him, which hath had no husband;
c12925	for her may he be defiled.
c12926	<i>But</i> he shall not defile himself, <i>being</i> a chief man among his people,
c12927	to profane himself.
c12928	They shall not make baldness upon their head,
c12929	neither shall they shave off the corner of their beard,
c12930	nor make any cuttings in their flesh.
c12931	They shall be holy unto their God,
c12932	and not profane the name of their God:
c12933	for the offerings of the LORD made by fire, <i>and</i> the bread of their God, they do offer:
c12934	therefore they shall be holy.
c12935	They shall not take a wife <i>that is</i> a whore, or profane;
c12936	a woman
c12937	put away from her husband:
c12938	neither shall they take
c12939	for he <i>is</i> holy unto his God.
c12940	Thou shalt sanctify
c12941	him therefore; for he offereth the bread of thy God:
c12942	he shall be holy
c12943	unto thee: for I the LORD, which sanctify you, <i>am</i> holy.
c12945	And the daughter of any priest,
c12946	if she profane herself
c12947	by playing the whore,
c12948	she profaneth her father:
c12949	she shall be burnt with fire.
c12951	And <i>he that is</i> the high priest among his brethren,
c12952	upon whose head the anointing oil was poured,
c12953	and that is consecrated
c12954	to put on the garments,
c12955	shall not uncover his head,
c12956	nor rend his clothes;
c12957	Neither shall he go in to any dead body,
c12958	nor defile himself for his father, or for his mother;
c12959	Neither shall he go out of the sanctuary,
c12960	nor profane the sanctuary of his God;
c12961	for the crown of the anointing oil of his God <i>is</i> upon
c12962	him: I <i>am</i> the LORD.
c12963	And he shall take a wife in her virginity.
c12964	A widow, or a divorced woman, or profane, <i>or</i> an harlot,
c12965	these shall he not take:
c12966	but he shall take a virgin of his own people to wife.
c12967	Neither shall he profane his seed among his people:
c12968	for I the LORD
c12969	do sanctify him.
c12970	And the LORD spake unto Moses,
c12971	saying,
c12972	Speak unto Aaron,
c12973	saying,
c12974	Whosoever <i>he be</i> of thy seed in their generations
c12975	that hath <i>any</i> blemish,
c12976	let him not approach
c12977	to offer the bread of his God.
c12978	For whatsoever man
c12979	<i>he be</i> that hath a blemish,
c12980	he shall not approach: a blind man, or a lame, or he that hath a flat nose, or any thing superfluous,
c12981	Or a man
c12982	that is brokenfooted, or brokenhanded,
c12983	Or crookbackt, or a dwarf, or that hath a blemish in his eye, or be scurvy, or scabbed, or hath his stones broken;
c12985	that hath a blemish of the seed of Aaron the priest shall come nigh
c12986	No man
c12987	to offer the offerings of the LORD made by fire:
c12988	he hath a blemish;
c12989	he shall not come nigh to offer the bread of his God.
c12991	He shall eat the bread of his God, <i>both</i> of the most holy, and of the holy.
c12992	Only he shall not go in unto the vail,
c12993	nor come nigh unto the altar,
c12994	because he hath a blemish;
c12995	that he profane not my sanctuaries:
c12996	for I the LORD
c12997	do sanctify them.
c12998	And Moses told <i>it</i> unto Aaron, and to his sons, and unto all the children of Israel.
c12999	And the LORD spake unto Moses,
c13000	saying,
c13001	Speak unto Aaron and to his sons,
c13002	that they separate themselves from the holy things of the children of Israel,
c13003	and that they profane not my holy name
c13004	<i>in those things</i> which they hallow
c13005	unto me: I <i>am</i> the LORD.
c13006	Say unto
c13008	them, Whosoever
c13009	<i>he be</i> of all your seed among your generations, that goeth unto the holy things,
c13010	which the children of Israel hallow unto the LORD,
c13011	having his uncleanness upon
c13012	him, that soul shall be cut off from my presence:
c13013	I <i>am</i> the LORD.
c13014	What man soever of the seed of Aaron
c13015	<i>is</i> a leper,
c13016	or hath a running issue;
c13017	he shall not eat of the holy things,
c13018	until he be clean.
c13020	And whoso toucheth any thing <i>that is</i> unclean <i>by</i> the dead,
c13021	or a man
c13022	whose seed goeth from him;
c13023	Or whosoever
c13024	toucheth any creeping thing,
c13025	whereby he may be made unclean,
c13026	or a man
c13027	of whom he may take uncleanness, whatsoever uncleanness he hath;
c13028	The soul
c13029	which hath touched
c13030	any such shall be unclean until even,
c13031	and shall not eat of the holy things,
c13032	unless he wash his flesh with water.
c13033	And when the sun is down,
c13034	he shall be clean,
c13035	and shall afterward eat of the holy things;
c13036	because it <i>is</i> his food.
c13037	That which dieth of itself, or is torn <i>with beasts,</i> he shall not eat
c13038	to defile
c13039	himself therewith: I <i>am</i> the LORD.
c13040	They shall therefore keep mine ordinance,
c13041	lest they bear sin for
c13042	it, and die
c13043	therefore, if they profane
c13044	it: I the LORD
c13045	do sanctify them.
c13046	There shall no stranger eat <i>of</i> the holy thing:
c13047	a sojourner of the priest, or an hired servant, shall not eat <i>of</i> the holy thing.
c13049	But if the priest buy <i>any</i> soul with his money,
c13050	he shall eat
c13051	of it, and he that is born in his house:
c13052	they shall eat of his meat.
c13054	If the priest's daughter also be <i>married</i> unto a stranger,
c13055	she may not eat of an offering of the holy things.
c13057	But if the priest's daughter be a widow, or divorced,
c13058	and have no child,
c13059	and is returned unto her father's house, as in her youth,
c13060	she shall eat of her father's meat:
c13061	but there shall no stranger eat thereof.
c13063	And if a man eat <i>of</i> the holy thing unwittingly,
c13064	then he shall put the fifth <i>part</i> thereof unto
c13065	it, and shall give <i>it</i> unto the priest with the holy thing.
c13066	And they shall not profane the holy things of the children of Israel,
c13067	which they offer unto the LORD;
c13068	Or suffer them to bear the iniquity of trespass,
c13069	when they eat their holy things:
c13070	for I the LORD
c13071	do sanctify them.
c13072	And the LORD spake unto Moses,
c13073	saying,
c13074	Speak unto Aaron, and to his sons, and unto all the children of Israel,
c13075	and say unto
c13076	them, Whatsoever <i>he be</i> of the house of Israel, or of the strangers in Israel,
c13077	that will offer his oblation for all his vows, and for all his freewill offerings,
c13078	which they will offer unto the LORD for a burnt offering;
c13079	<i>Ye shall offer</i> at your own will a male without blemish, of the beeves, of the sheep, or of the goats.
c13080	<i>But</i> whatsoever
c13081	hath a blemish,
c13082	<i>that</i> shall ye not offer:
c13083	for it shall not be acceptable for you.
c13084	And whosoever
c13085	offereth a sacrifice of peace offerings unto the LORD
c13086	to accomplish <i>his</i> vow,
c13087	or a freewill offering in beeves or sheep,
c13088	it shall be perfect to be accepted;
c13089	there shall be no blemish therein.
c13090	Blind, or broken, or maimed, or having a wen, or scurvy, or scabbed,
c13091	ye shall not offer these unto the LORD,
c13092	nor make an offering by fire of them upon the altar unto the LORD.
c13093	Either a bullock or a lamb that hath any thing superfluous or lacking in his parts,
c13094	that mayest thou offer <i>for</i> a freewill offering;
c13095	but for a vow it shall not be accepted.
c13096	Ye shall not offer unto the LORD that which is bruised, or crushed, or broken, or cut;
c13097	neither shall ye make <i>any offering thereof</i> in your land.
c13098	Neither from a stranger's hand shall ye offer the bread of your God of any of these;
c13099	because their corruption
c13100	<i>is</i> in them, <i>and</i> blemishes
c13101	<i>be</i> in them: they shall not be accepted for you.
c13102	And the LORD spake unto Moses,
c13103	saying,
c13105	When a bullock, or a sheep, or a goat, is brought forth,
c13106	then it shall be seven days under the dam;
c13107	and from the eighth day and thenceforth it shall be accepted for an offering made by fire unto the LORD.
c13108	And <i>whether it be</i> cow or ewe,
c13109	ye shall not kill it and her young both in one day.
c13110	And when ye will offer a sacrifice of thanksgiving unto the LORD,
c13111	offer <i>it</i> at your own will.
c13112	On the same day it shall be eaten up;
c13113	ye shall leave none of it until the morrow:
c13114	I <i>am</i> the LORD.
c13115	Therefore shall ye keep my commandments,
c13116	and do
c13117	them: I <i>am</i> the LORD.
c13118	Neither shall ye profane my holy name;
c13119	but I will be hallowed among the children of Israel:
c13120	I <i>am</i> the LORD
c13121	which hallow you,
c13122	That brought you out of the land of Egypt,
c13123	to be your God:
c13124	I <i>am</i> the LORD.
c13125	And the LORD spake unto Moses,
c13126	saying,
c13127	Speak unto the children of Israel,
c13128	and say unto
c13129	them, <i>Concerning</i> the feasts of the LORD,
c13130	which ye shall proclaim
c13131	<i>to be</i> holy convocations,
c13132	<i>even</i> these
c13133	<i>are</i> my feasts.
c13134	Six days shall work be done:
c13135	but the seventh day <i>is</i> the sabbath of rest, an holy convocation;
c13136	ye shall do no work
c13137	<i>therein:</i> it <i>is</i> the sabbath of the LORD in all your dwellings.
c13138	These <i>are</i> the feasts of the LORD, <i>even</i> holy convocations,
c13139	which ye shall proclaim in their seasons.
c13140	In the fourteenth <i>day</i> of the first month at even <i>is</i> the LORD'S passover.
c13141	And on the fifteenth day of the same month <i>is</i> the feast of unleavened bread unto the LORD:
c13142	seven days ye must eat unleavened bread.
c13143	In the first day ye shall have an holy convocation:
c13144	ye shall do no servile work therein.
c13145	But ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto the LORD seven days:
c13146	in the seventh day <i>is</i> an holy convocation:
c13147	ye shall do no servile work <i>therein.</i>
c13148	And the LORD spake unto Moses,
c13149	saying,
c13150	Speak unto the children of Israel,
c13151	and say unto
c13152	them, When ye be come into the land
c13153	which I give
c13154	unto you, and shall reap the harvest
c13155	thereof, then ye shall bring a sheaf of the firstfruits of your harvest unto the priest:
c13156	And he shall wave the sheaf before the LORD, to be accepted
c13157	for you: on the morrow after the sabbath the priest shall wave it.
c13158	And ye shall offer that day
c13159	when ye wave the sheaf
c13160	an he lamb without blemish of the first year for a burnt offering unto the LORD.
c13161	And the meat offering thereof <i>shall be</i> two tenth deals of fine flour
c13162	mingled with oil,
c13163	an offering made by fire unto the LORD <i>for</i> a sweet savour:
c13164	and the drink offering thereof <i>shall be</i> of wine, the fourth <i>part</i> of an hin.
c13165	And ye shall eat neither bread, nor parched corn, nor green ears, until the selfsame day
c13166	that ye have brought an offering unto your God:
c13167	<i>it shall be</i> a statute for ever throughout your generations in all your dwellings.
c13168	And ye shall count unto you from the morrow after the sabbath, from the day
c13169	that ye brought the sheaf of the wave offering;
c13170	seven sabbaths shall be complete:
c13171	Even unto the morrow after the seventh sabbath shall ye number fifty days;
c13172	and ye shall offer a new meat offering unto the LORD.
c13173	Ye shall bring out of your habitations two wave loaves
c13174	of two tenth deals: they shall be of fine flour;
c13175	they shall be baken with leaven;
c13176	<i>they are</i> the firstfruits unto the LORD.
c13177	And ye shall offer with the bread seven lambs without blemish of the first year, and one young bullock, and two rams:
c13178	they shall be <i>for</i> a burnt offering unto the LORD,
c13179	with their meat offering, and their drink offerings, <i>even</i> an offering made by fire, of sweet savour unto the LORD.
c13180	Then ye shall sacrifice one kid of the goats for a sin offering,
c13181	and two lambs of the first year for a sacrifice of peace offerings.
c13182	And the priest shall wave them with the bread of the firstfruits <i>for</i> a wave offering before the LORD, with the two lambs:
c13183	they shall be holy to the LORD for the priest.
c13184	And ye shall proclaim on the selfsame day,
c13185	<i>that</i> it may be an holy convocation
c13186	unto you: ye shall do no servile work
c13187	<i>therein: it shall be</i> a statute for ever in all your dwellings throughout your generations.
c13189	And when ye reap the harvest of your land,
c13190	thou shalt not make clean riddance of the corners of thy field
c13191	when thou reapest,
c13192	neither shalt thou gather any gleaning of thy harvest:
c13193	thou shalt leave them unto the poor, and to the stranger:
c13194	I <i>am</i> the LORD your God.
c13195	And the LORD spake unto Moses,
c13196	saying,
c13197	Speak unto the children of Israel,
c13198	saying,
c13199	In the seventh month, in the first <i>day</i> of the month, shall ye have a sabbath, a memorial of blowing of trumpets, an holy convocation.
c13200	Ye shall do no servile work
c13201	<i>therein:</i> but ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto the LORD.
c13202	And the LORD spake unto Moses,
c13203	saying,
c13204	Also on the tenth <i>day</i> of this seventh month <i>there shall be</i> a day of atonement:
c13205	it shall be an holy convocation
c13206	unto you; and ye shall afflict your souls,
c13207	and offer an offering made by fire unto the LORD.
c13208	And ye shall do no work in that same day:
c13209	for it <i>is</i> a day of atonement,
c13210	to make an atonement for you before the LORD your God.
c13211	For whatsoever soul
c13212	<i>it be</i> that shall not be afflicted in that same day,
c13213	he shall be cut off from among his people.
c13214	And whatsoever soul
c13215	<i>it be</i> that doeth any work in that same day,
c13216	the same soul will I destroy from among his people.
c13217	Ye shall do no manner of work:
c13218	<i>it shall be</i> a statute for ever throughout your generations in all your dwellings.
c13219	It <i>shall be</i> unto you a sabbath of rest,
c13220	and ye shall afflict your souls:
c13221	in the ninth <i>day</i> of the month at even, from even unto even, shall ye celebrate your sabbath.
c13222	And the LORD spake unto Moses,
c13223	saying,
c13224	Speak unto the children of Israel,
c13225	saying,
c13226	The fifteenth day of this seventh month <i>shall be</i> the feast of tabernacles <i>for</i> seven days unto the LORD.
c13227	On the first day <i>shall be</i> an holy convocation:
c13228	ye shall do no servile work <i>therein.</i>
c13229	Seven days ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto the LORD:
c13230	on the eighth day shall be an holy convocation
c13231	unto you; and ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto the LORD:
c13232	it <i>is</i> a solemn assembly;
c13233	<i>and</i> ye shall do no servile work <i>therein.</i>
c13234	These <i>are</i> the feasts of the LORD,
c13235	which ye shall proclaim <i>to be</i> holy convocations,
c13236	to offer an offering made by fire unto the LORD, a burnt offering, and a meat offering, a sacrifice, and drink offerings, every thing upon his day:
c13237	Beside the sabbaths of the LORD, and beside your gifts, and beside all your vows, and beside all your freewill offerings,
c13238	which ye give unto the LORD.
c13239	Also in the fifteenth day of the seventh month,
c13240	when ye have gathered in the fruit of the land,
c13241	ye shall keep a feast unto the LORD seven days:
c13242	on the first day <i>shall be</i> a sabbath,
c13243	and on the eighth day <i>shall be</i> a sabbath.
c13244	And ye shall take you on the first day the boughs of goodly trees, branches of palm trees, and the boughs of thick trees, and willows of the brook;
c13245	and ye shall rejoice before the LORD your God seven days.
c13246	And ye shall keep it a feast unto the LORD seven days in the year.
c13247	<i>It shall be</i> a statute for ever in your generations:
c13248	ye shall celebrate it in the seventh month.
c13249	Ye shall dwell in booths seven days;
c13250	all that are Israelites born shall dwell in booths:
c13251	That your generations may know
c13252	that I made the children of Israel to dwell in booths,
c13253	when I brought them out of the land of Egypt:
c13254	I <i>am</i> the LORD your God.
c13255	And Moses declared unto the children of Israel the feasts of the LORD.
c13256	And the LORD spake unto Moses,
c13257	saying,
c13258	Command the children of Israel,
c13259	that they bring unto thee pure oil olive beaten for the light,
c13260	to cause the lamps to burn continually.
c13261	Without the vail of the testimony, in the tabernacle of the congregation, shall Aaron order it from the evening unto the morning before the LORD continually:
c13262	<i>it shall be</i> a statute for ever in your generations.
c13263	He shall order the lamps upon the pure candlestick before the LORD continually.
c13264	And thou shalt take fine flour,
c13265	and bake twelve cakes
c13266	thereof: two tenth deals shall be in one cake.
c13267	And thou shalt set them in two rows,
c13268	six on a row,
c13269	upon the pure table before the LORD.
c13270	And thou shalt put pure frankincense upon <i>each</i> row,
c13271	that it may be on the bread for a memorial,
c13272	<i>even</i> an offering made by fire unto the LORD.
c13273	Every sabbath he shall set it in order before the LORD continually,
c13274	<i>being taken</i> from the children of Israel by an everlasting covenant.
c13275	And it shall be Aaron's and his sons';
c13276	and they shall eat it in the holy place:
c13277	for it <i>is</i> most holy unto him of the offerings of the LORD made by fire
c13278	by a perpetual statute.
c13279	And the son of an Israelitish woman, whose father <i>was</i> an Egyptian, went out
c13281	among the children of Israel:
c13282	and this son of the Israelitish <i>woman</i> and a man of Israel strove together in the camp;
c13283	And the Israelitish woman's son blasphemed the name
c13284	<i>of the LORD,</i> and cursed.
c13285	And they brought him unto Moses:
c13286	(and his mother's name <i>was</i> Shelomith, the daughter of Dibri, of the tribe of Dan:)
c13287	And they put him in ward,
c13288	that the mind of the LORD might be shewed them.
c13289	And the LORD spake unto Moses,
c13290	saying,
c13291	Bring forth him that hath cursed without the camp;
c13292	and let all that heard <i>him</i> lay their hands upon his head,
c13293	and let all the congregation stone him.
c13294	And thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel,
c13295	saying,
c13296	Whosoever
c13297	curseth his God
c13298	shall bear his sin.
c13300	And he that blasphemeth the name of the LORD,
c13301	he shall surely be put to death,
c13302	<i>and</i> all the congregation shall certainly stone
c13303	him: as well the stranger, as he that is born in the land,
c13304	when he blasphemeth the name
c13305	<i>of the LORD,</i> shall be put to death.
c13306	And he
c13307	that killeth any man
c13308	shall surely be put to death.
c13310	And he that killeth a beast
c13311	shall make it good; beast for beast.
c13313	And if a man cause a blemish in his neighbour;
c13314	as he hath done,
c13315	so shall it be done to him;
c13316	Breach for breach,
c13317	eye for eye,
c13318	tooth for tooth:
c13319	as he hath caused a blemish in a man,
c13320	so shall it be done to him <i>again.</i>
c13322	And he that killeth a beast,
c13323	he shall restore
c13325	it: and he that killeth a man,
c13326	he shall be put to death.
c13327	Ye shall have one manner of law,
c13328	as well for the stranger, as for one of your own country:
c13329	for I <i>am</i> the LORD your God.
c13330	And Moses spake to the children of Israel,
c13331	that they should bring forth him that had cursed out of the camp,
c13332	and stone him with stones.
c13333	And the children of Israel did
c13334	as the LORD commanded Moses.
c13335	And the LORD spake unto Moses in mount Sinai,
c13336	saying,
c13337	Speak unto the children of Israel,
c13338	and say unto
c13339	them, When ye come into the land
c13340	which I give
c13341	you, then shall the land keep a sabbath unto the LORD.
c13342	Six years thou shalt sow thy field,
c13343	and six years thou shalt prune thy vineyard,
c13344	and gather in the fruit thereof;
c13345	But in the seventh year shall be a sabbath of rest unto the land, a sabbath for the LORD:
c13346	thou shalt neither sow thy field,
c13347	nor prune thy vineyard.
c13348	That which groweth of its own accord of thy harvest thou shalt not reap,
c13349	neither gather the grapes of thy vine undressed:
c13350	<i>for</i> it is a year of rest unto the land.
c13351	And the sabbath of the land shall be meat for you; for thee, and for thy servant, and for thy maid, and for thy hired servant, and for thy stranger
c13352	that sojourneth with thee,
c13353	And for thy cattle, and for the beast
c13354	that <i>are</i> in thy land,
c13355	shall all the increase thereof be
c13356	meat.
c13357	And thou shalt number seven sabbaths of years unto thee, seven times seven years;
c13358	and the space of the seven sabbaths of years shall be unto thee forty and nine years.
c13359	Then shalt thou cause the trumpet of the jubile to sound on the tenth <i>day</i> of the seventh month,
c13360	in the day of atonement shall ye make the trumpet sound throughout all your land.
c13361	And ye shall hallow the fiftieth year,
c13362	and proclaim liberty throughout <i>all</i> the land unto all the inhabitants
c13363	thereof: it shall be a jubile
c13364	unto you; and ye shall return
c13365	every man unto his possession,
c13367	every man unto his family.
c13368	and ye shall return
c13369	A jubile shall that fiftieth year
c13370	be
c13371	unto you: ye shall not sow,
c13372	neither reap that which groweth of itself
c13373	in it, nor gather <i>the grapes</i> in it of thy vine undressed.
c13374	For it <i>is</i> the jubile;
c13375	it shall be holy
c13376	unto you: ye shall eat the increase thereof out of the field.
c13377	In the year of this jubile ye shall return
c13378	every man unto his possession.
c13379	And if thou sell ought unto thy neighbour,
c13380	or buyest <i>ought</i> of thy neighbour's hand,
c13381	ye shall not oppress
c13382	one another:
c13383	According to the number of years after the jubile thou shalt buy of thy neighbour,
c13384	<i>and</i> according unto the number of years of the fruits he shall sell unto thee:
c13385	According to the multitude of years thou shalt increase the price
c13386	thereof, and according to the fewness of years thou shalt diminish the price
c13387	of it: for <i>according</i> to the number <i>of the years</i> of the fruits doth he sell unto thee.
c13388	Ye shall not therefore oppress
c13389	one another;
c13390	but thou shalt fear thy God:
c13391	for I <i>am</i> the LORD your God.
c13392	Wherefore ye shall do my statutes,
c13393	and keep my judgments,
c13394	and do
c13395	them; and ye shall dwell in the land in safety.
c13396	And the land shall yield her fruit,
c13397	and ye shall eat your fill,
c13398	and dwell therein in safety.
c13399	And if ye shall say,
c13400	What shall we eat the seventh year?
c13401	behold, we shall not sow,
c13402	nor gather in our increase:
c13403	Then I will command my blessing upon you in the sixth year,
c13404	and it shall bring forth fruit for three years.
c13405	And ye shall sow the eighth year,
c13406	and eat <i>yet</i> of old fruit until the ninth year;
c13407	until her fruits come in
c13408	ye shall eat <i>of</i> the old <i>store.</i>
c13409	The land shall not be sold for ever:
c13410	for the land
c13411	<i>is</i> mine; for ye <i>are</i> strangers and sojourners with me.
c13412	And in all the land of your possession ye shall grant a redemption for the land.
c13413	If thy brother be waxen poor,
c13414	and hath sold away <i>some</i> of his possession,
c13415	come to redeem
c13416	and if any of his kin
c13417	it, then shall he redeem that which his brother sold.
c13419	And if the man have none to redeem
c13420	it, and himself
c13421	be able to redeem it;
c13422	Then let him count the years of the sale
c13423	thereof, and restore the overplus unto the man
c13424	to whom he sold
c13425	it; that he may return unto his possession.
c13426	But if he be not able
c13427	to restore
c13428	<i>it</i> to him, then that which is sold shall remain in the hand
c13429	of him that hath bought
c13430	it until the year of jubile:
c13431	and in the jubile it shall go out,
c13432	and he shall return unto his possession.
c13434	And if a man sell a dwelling house in a walled city,
c13435	then he may redeem
c13436	it within a whole year after it is sold;
c13437	<i>within</i> a full year may he redeem it.
c13438	And if it be not redeemed
c13439	within the space of a full year,
c13440	then the house that
c13442	<i>is</i> in the walled city shall be established
c13443	for ever
c13444	to him that bought
c13445	it throughout his generations: it shall not
c13446	go out in the jubile.
c13447	But the houses of the villages
c13448	which have no wall round about
c13449	them shall be counted as the fields of the country:
c13450	they may be redeemed,
c13451	and they shall go out in the jubile.
c13452	Notwithstanding the cities of the Levites, <i>and</i> the houses of the cities of their possession,
c13453	may the Levites redeem at any time.
c13454	And if a man purchase of the Levites,
c13455	then the house that was sold, and the city of his possession, shall go out in <i>the year of</i> jubile:
c13456	for the houses of the cities of the Levites
c13457	<i>are</i> their possession among the children of Israel.
c13458	But the field of the suburbs of their cities may not be sold;
c13459	for it <i>is</i> their perpetual possession.
c13460	And if thy brother be waxen poor,
c13461	and fallen in decay with
c13462	thee; then thou shalt relieve
c13463	him: <i>yea, though he be</i> a stranger, or a sojourner;
c13464	that he may live with thee.
c13465	Take thou no usury of him, or increase:
c13466	but fear thy God;
c13467	that thy brother may live with thee.
c13468	Thou shalt not give him thy money upon usury,
c13469	nor lend him thy victuals for increase.
c13470	I <i>am</i> the LORD your God,
c13471	which brought you forth out of the land of Egypt,
c13472	to give you the land of Canaan,
c13473	<i>and</i> to be your God.
c13474	And if thy brother <i>that dwelleth</i> by thee be waxen poor,
c13475	and be sold
c13476	unto thee; thou shalt not compel him to serve as a bondservant:
c13477	<i>But</i> as an hired servant, <i>and</i> as a sojourner, he shall be with
c13478	thee, <i>and</i> shall serve thee unto the year of jubile:
c13479	And <i>then</i> shall he depart from thee, <i>both</i> he and his children with
c13480	him, and shall return unto his own family,
c13481	and unto the possession of his fathers shall he return.
c13482	For they <i>are</i> my servants,
c13483	which I brought forth out of the land of Egypt:
c13484	they shall not be sold as bondmen.
c13485	Thou shalt not rule over him with rigour;
c13486	but shalt fear thy God.
c13487	Both thy bondmen, and thy bondmaids,
c13488	which thou shalt have,
c13489	<i>shall be</i> of the heathen
c13490	that are round about
c13491	you; of them shall ye buy bondmen and bondmaids.
c13492	Moreover of the children of the strangers
c13493	that do sojourn among
c13495	you, of them shall ye buy, and of their families
c13496	that <i>are</i> with
c13497	you, which they begat in your land:
c13498	and they shall be your possession.
c13499	And ye shall take them as an inheritance for your children after
c13500	you, to inherit <i>them for</i> a possession; they shall be your bondmen for ever:
c13502	but over your brethren the children of Israel, ye shall not rule one over another
c13503	with rigour.
c13504	And if a sojourner or stranger wax rich by
c13505	thee, and thy brother <i>that dwelleth</i> by him wax poor,
c13506	and sell himself unto the stranger <i>or</i> sojourner by thee, or to the stock of the stranger's family:
c13507	After that he is sold
c13508	he may be redeemed again;
c13509	one of his brethren may redeem him:
c13510	Either his uncle, or his uncle's son, may redeem
c13511	him, or <i>any</i> that is nigh of kin unto him of his family may redeem
c13512	him; or if he be able,
c13513	he may redeem himself.
c13514	And he shall reckon with him that bought
c13515	him from the year that he was sold
c13516	to him unto the year of jubile:
c13517	and the price of his sale shall be according unto the number of years,
c13518	according to the time of an hired servant shall it be with him.
c13519	If <i>there be</i> yet many years
c13520	<i>behind,</i> according unto them he shall give again the price of his redemption out of the money that he was bought for.
c13521	And if there remain but few years unto the year of jubile,
c13522	then he shall count
c13523	with him, <i>and</i> according unto his years shall he give him again the price of his redemption.
c13524	<i>And</i> as a yearly hired servant shall he be with
c13525	him: <i>and the other</i> shall not rule with rigour over him in thy sight.
c13526	And if he be not redeemed in these
c13527	<i>years,</i> then he shall go out in the year of jubile, <i>both</i> he, and his children with him.
c13528	For unto me the children of Israel <i>are</i> servants;
c13529	they <i>are</i> my servants
c13530	whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt:
c13531	I <i>am</i> the LORD your God.
c13532	Ye shall make you no idols nor graven image,
c13533	neither rear you up a standing image,
c13534	neither shall ye set up <i>any</i> image of stone in your land,
c13535	to bow down unto
c13536	it: for I <i>am</i> the LORD your God.
c13537	Ye shall keep my sabbaths,
c13538	and reverence my sanctuary:
c13539	I <i>am</i> the LORD.
c13540	If ye walk in my statutes,
c13541	and keep my commandments,
c13542	and do them;
c13543	Then I will give you rain in due season,
c13544	and the land shall yield her increase,
c13545	and the trees of the field shall yield their fruit.
c13546	And your threshing shall reach unto the vintage,
c13547	and the vintage shall reach unto the sowing time:
c13548	and ye shall eat your bread to the full,
c13549	and dwell in your land safely.
c13550	And I will give peace in the land,
c13551	and ye shall lie down,
c13552	and none shall make <i>you</i> afraid:
c13553	and I will rid evil beasts out of the land,
c13554	neither shall the sword go through your land.
c13555	And ye shall chase your enemies,
c13556	and they shall fall before you by the sword.
c13557	And five of you shall chase an hundred,
c13558	and an hundred of you shall put ten thousand to flight:
c13559	and your enemies shall fall before you by the sword.
c13560	For I will have respect unto
c13561	you, and make you fruitful,
c13562	and multiply
c13563	you, and establish my covenant with you.
c13564	And ye shall eat old store,
c13565	and bring forth the old because of the new.
c13566	And I will set my tabernacle among
c13567	you: and my soul shall not abhor you.
c13568	And I will walk among
c13569	you, and will be your God,
c13570	and ye shall be my people.
c13571	I <i>am</i> the LORD your God,
c13572	which brought you forth out of the land of Egypt,
c13573	that ye should not be their bondmen;
c13574	and I have broken the bands of your yoke,
c13575	and made you go upright.
c13576	But if ye will not hearken
c13577	unto me, and will not do all these commandments;
c13578	And if ye shall despise my statutes,
c13579	or if your soul abhor my judgments,
c13580	so that ye will not do all my commandments,
c13581	<i>but</i> that ye break my covenant:
c13582	I also will do this
c13583	unto you; I will even appoint over you terror, consumption, and the burning ague,
c13584	that shall consume the eyes,
c13585	and cause sorrow of heart:
c13586	and ye shall sow your seed in vain,
c13587	for your enemies shall eat it.
c13588	And I will set my face
c13589	against you, and ye shall be slain before your enemies:
c13590	they that hate you shall reign
c13591	over you; and ye shall flee
c13592	when none
c13593	pursueth you.
c13594	And if ye will not yet for all this hearken
c13596	unto me, then I will punish you seven times more for your sins.
c13597	And I will break the pride of your power;
c13598	and I will make your heaven as iron,
c13599	and your earth as brass:
c13600	And your strength shall be spent in vain:
c13601	for your land shall not yield her increase,
c13602	neither shall the trees of the land yield their fruits.
c13603	And if ye walk contrary unto
c13604	me, and will not
c13605	hearken
c13606	unto me; I will bring seven times more plagues upon you according to your sins.
c13607	I will also send wild beasts
c13608	among you, which shall rob you of your children,
c13609	and destroy your cattle,
c13610	and make you few in number;
c13611	and your <i>high</i> ways shall be desolate.
c13612	And if ye will not be reformed by me by these things,
c13613	but will walk contrary unto me;
c13614	Then will I also walk contrary unto
c13615	you, and will punish you yet seven times for your sins.
c13616	And I will bring a sword upon
c13617	you, that shall avenge the quarrel of <i>my</i> covenant:
c13618	and when ye are gathered together within your cities,
c13619	I will send the pestilence among
c13620	you; and ye shall be delivered into the hand of the enemy.
c13621	<i>And</i> when I have broken the staff of your bread,
c13622	ten women shall bake your bread in one oven,
c13623	and they shall deliver <i>you</i> your bread again by weight:
c13624	and ye shall eat,
c13625	and not be satisfied.
c13626	And if ye will not for all this hearken
c13627	unto me, but walk contrary unto me;
c13628	Then I will walk contrary unto you also in fury;
c13629	and I, even I, will chastise you seven times for your sins.
c13630	And ye shall eat the flesh of your sons,
c13631	and the flesh of your daughters shall ye eat.
c13632	And I will destroy your high places,
c13633	and cut down your images,
c13634	and cast your carcases upon the carcases of your idols,
c13635	and my soul shall abhor you.
c13636	And I will make your cities waste,
c13637	and bring your sanctuaries unto desolation,
c13638	and I will not smell the savour of your sweet odours.
c13639	And I will bring the land into desolation:
c13640	and your enemies which dwell therein shall be astonished at it.
c13642	And I will scatter you among the heathen,
c13643	and will draw out a sword after
c13644	you: and your land shall be desolate,
c13645	and your cities waste.
c13646	Then shall the land enjoy her sabbaths, as long as
c13647	it lieth desolate,
c13648	and ye <i>be</i> in your enemies' land;
c13649	<i>even</i> then shall the land rest,
c13650	and enjoy her sabbaths.
c13651	As long as
c13652	it lieth desolate
c13653	it shall rest;
c13654	because it did not rest in your sabbaths,
c13655	when ye dwelt upon it.
c13656	And upon them that are left
c13657	<i>alive</i> of you I will send a faintness into their hearts in the lands of their enemies;
c13658	and the sound of a shaken leaf shall chase
c13659	them; and they shall flee, as fleeing from a sword;
c13660	and they shall fall
c13661	when none pursueth.
c13662	And they shall fall
c13663	one upon another,
c13664	as it were before a sword,
c13665	when none pursueth:
c13666	and ye shall have no power to stand before your enemies.
c13667	And ye shall perish among the heathen,
c13668	and the land of your enemies shall eat you up.
c13670	And they that are left
c13671	of you shall pine away in their iniquity in your enemies' lands;
c13672	and also in the iniquities of their fathers shall they pine away with them.
c13673	If they shall confess their iniquity, and the iniquity of their fathers, with their trespass
c13674	which they trespassed
c13675	against me, and that also they have walked contrary unto me;
c13676	And <i>that</i> I also have walked contrary unto
c13677	them, and have brought them into the land of their enemies;
c13678	if then their uncircumcised hearts be humbled,
c13679	and they then accept of the punishment of their iniquity:
c13680	Then will I remember my covenant with Jacob,
c13681	and also my covenant with Isaac,
c13682	and also my covenant with Abraham will I remember;
c13683	and I will remember the land.
c13684	The land also shall be left of
c13685	them, and shall enjoy her sabbaths,
c13686	while she lieth desolate
c13687	without them: and they shall accept of the punishment of their iniquity:
c13688	because,
c13689	even because they despised my judgments,
c13690	and because their soul abhorred my statutes.
c13691	And yet for all that,
c13692	when they be in the land of their enemies,
c13693	I will not cast them away,
c13694	neither will I abhor
c13695	them, to destroy them utterly,
c13696	and to break my covenant with
c13697	them: for I <i>am</i> the LORD their God.
c13698	But I will for their sakes remember the covenant of their ancestors,
c13699	whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt in the sight of the heathen,
c13700	that I might be their God:
c13701	I <i>am</i> the LORD.
c13702	These <i>are</i> the statutes and judgments and laws,
c13703	which the LORD made between him and the children of Israel in mount Sinai by the hand of Moses.
c13704	And the LORD spake unto Moses,
c13705	saying,
c13706	Speak unto the children of Israel,
c13707	and say unto
c13709	them, When a man shall make a singular vow,
c13710	the persons <i>shall be</i> for the LORD by thy estimation.
c13711	And thy estimation shall be of the male from twenty years old even unto sixty years old,
c13712	even thy estimation shall be fifty shekels of silver, after the shekel of the sanctuary.
c13713	And if it <i>be</i> a female,
c13714	then thy estimation shall be thirty shekels.
c13715	And if <i>it be</i> from five years old even unto twenty years old,
c13716	then thy estimation shall be of the male twenty shekels,
c13717	and for the female ten shekels.
c13718	And if <i>it be</i> from a month old even unto five years old,
c13719	then thy estimation shall be of the male five shekels of silver,
c13720	and for the female thy estimation <i>shall be</i> three shekels of silver.
c13721	And if <i>it be</i> from sixty years old and above;
c13722	if <i>it be</i> a male,
c13723	then thy estimation shall be fifteen shekels,
c13724	and for the female ten shekels.
c13725	But if he be poorer than thy estimation,
c13726	then he shall present himself before the priest,
c13727	and the priest shall value
c13728	him; according to
c13729	his ability that vowed
c13730	shall the priest value him.
c13731	And if <i>it be</i> a beast,
c13732	whereof men bring an offering unto the LORD,
c13733	all
c13734	that <i>any man</i> giveth of such unto the LORD
c13735	shall be holy.
c13736	He shall not alter
c13737	it, nor change
c13738	it, a good for a bad,
c13739	or a bad for a good:
c13740	and if he shall at all change beast for beast,
c13742	then it and the exchange thereof shall be holy.
c13743	And if <i>it be</i> any unclean beast,
c13744	of which they do not offer a sacrifice unto the LORD,
c13745	then he shall present the beast before the priest:
c13746	And the priest shall value it, whether it be good or bad:
c13747	as thou valuest it, <i>who art</i> the priest, so shall it be.
c13748	But if he will at all redeem
c13749	it, then he shall add a fifth <i>part</i> thereof unto thy estimation.
c13751	And when a man shall sanctify his house <i>to be</i> holy unto the LORD,
c13752	then the priest shall estimate it, whether it be good or bad:
c13753	as the priest shall estimate
c13754	it, so shall it stand.
c13755	And if he that sanctified it will redeem his house,
c13756	then he shall add the fifth <i>part</i> of the money of thy estimation unto
c13757	it, and it shall be his.
c13758	And if a man shall sanctify unto the LORD <i>some part</i> of a field of his possession,
c13759	then thy estimation shall be according to the seed thereof: an homer of barley seed <i>shall be valued</i> at fifty shekels of silver.
c13760	If he sanctify his field from the year of jubile,
c13761	according to thy estimation it shall stand.
c13762	But if he sanctify his field after the jubile,
c13763	then the priest shall reckon unto him the money according to the years
c13764	that remain, even unto the year of the jubile,
c13765	and it shall be abated from thy estimation.
c13766	And if he that sanctified the field will in any wise redeem
c13768	it, then he shall add the fifth <i>part</i> of the money of thy estimation unto
c13769	it, and it shall be assured to him.
c13770	And if he will not redeem the field,
c13771	or if he have sold the field to another man,
c13772	it shall not be redeemed any more.
c13773	But the field, when it goeth out in the jubile, shall be
c13775	holy unto the LORD, as a field devoted;
c13776	the possession thereof shall be the priest's.
c13777	And if <i>a man</i> sanctify unto the LORD a field which he hath bought,
c13778	which <i>is</i> not of the fields of his possession;
c13780	Then the priest shall reckon unto him the worth of thy estimation, <i>even</i> unto the year of the jubile:
c13781	and he shall give thine estimation in that day,
c13782	<i>as</i> a holy thing unto the LORD.
c13783	In the year of the jubile the field shall return
c13784	unto him of whom it was bought,
c13785	<i>even</i> to him to whom the possession of the land <i>did belong.</i>
c13786	And all thy estimations shall be according to the shekel of the sanctuary:
c13787	twenty gerahs shall be the shekel.
c13788	Only the firstling
c13789	which should be the LORD'S firstling,
c13790	of the beasts,
c13791	no man shall sanctify
c13792	it; whether <i>it be</i> ox,
c13793	or sheep:
c13794	it <i>is</i> the LORD'S.
c13795	And if <i>it be</i> of an unclean beast,
c13796	then he shall redeem <i>it</i> according to thine estimation,
c13797	and shall add a fifth <i>part</i> of it thereto:
c13798	or if it be not redeemed,
c13799	then it shall be sold according to thy estimation.
c13800	Notwithstanding no devoted thing,
c13801	that a man shall devote unto the LORD
c13802	of all
c13803	that
c13804	he hath, <i>both</i> of man and beast, and of the field of his possession,
c13805	shall be sold
c13806	or redeemed:
c13807	every devoted thing
c13808	<i>is</i> most holy unto the LORD.
c13810	which shall be devoted of men, shall be redeemed;
c13811	None devoted,
c13812	<i>but</i> shall surely be put to death.
c13813	And all the tithe of the land, <i>whether</i> of the seed of the land, <i>or</i> of the fruit of the tree,
c13814	<i>is</i> the LORD'S:
c13815	<i>it is</i> holy unto the LORD.
c13816	And if a man will at all redeem <i>ought</i> of his tithes,
c13817	he shall add thereto the fifth <i>part</i> thereof.
c13818	And concerning the tithe of the herd, or of the flock, <i>even</i> of whatsoever
c13819	passeth under the rod,
c13820	the tenth shall be holy unto the LORD.
c13821	He shall not search whether it be good or bad,
c13822	neither shall he change
c13823	it: and if he change it at all,
c13825	then both it and the change thereof shall be holy;
c13826	it shall not be redeemed.
c13827	These <i>are</i> the commandments,
c13828	which the LORD commanded Moses for the children of Israel in mount Sinai.
c13829	And the LORD spake unto Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, in the tabernacle of the congregation, on the first <i>day</i> of the second month, in the second year
c13830	after they were come out of the land of Egypt,
c13831	saying,
c13832	Take ye the sum of all the congregation of the children of Israel, after their families, by the house of their fathers, with the number of <i>their</i> names, every male by their polls;
c13833	From twenty years old and upward, all
c13834	that are able to go forth to war in Israel:
c13835	thou and Aaron shall number them by their armies.
c13836	And with you there shall be a man of every tribe;
c13837	every one
c13838	head of the house of his fathers.
c13839	And these <i>are</i> the names of the men

c13859	and they declared their pedigrees after their families, by the house of their fathers, according to the number of the names, from twenty years old and upward, by their polls.

c13896	throughout their generations, after their families, by the house of their fathers, according to the number of the names, from twenty years old and upward, all that were able to go forth to war;
c13897	Those that were numbered of them, <i>even</i> of the tribe of Naphtali, <i>were</i> fifty and three thousand and four hundred.
c13898	These <i>are</i> those that were numbered,
c13899	which Moses and Aaron numbered, and the princes of Israel, <i>being</i> twelve men:
c13900	each one was for the house of his fathers.
c13901	So were all those that were numbered of the children of Israel, by the house of their fathers, from twenty years old and upward, all
c13902	that were able to go forth to war in Israel;
c13903	Even all they that were numbered were six hundred thousand and three thousand and five hundred and fifty.
c13904	But the Levites after the tribe of their fathers were not numbered among them.
c13905	For the LORD had spoken unto Moses,
c13906	saying,
c13907	Only thou shalt not number the tribe of Levi,
c13908	neither take the sum of them among the children of Israel:
c13909	But thou shalt appoint the Levites over the tabernacle of testimony, and over all the vessels thereof, and over all things
c13910	that
c13911	<i>belong</i> to it: they shall bear the tabernacle, and all the vessels
c13912	thereof; and they shall minister
c13913	unto it, and shall encamp round about the tabernacle.
c13915	And when the tabernacle setteth forward,
c13916	the Levites shall take it down:
c13918	and when the tabernacle is to be pitched,
c13919	the Levites shall set it up:
c13920	and the stranger
c13921	that cometh nigh
c13922	shall be put to death.
c13923	And the children of Israel shall pitch their tents,
c13924	every man by his own camp,
c13925	and every man by his own standard,
c13926	throughout their hosts.
c13927	But the Levites shall pitch round about the tabernacle of testimony,
c13928	that there be no wrath upon the congregation of the children of Israel:
c13929	and the Levites shall keep the charge of the tabernacle of testimony.
c13930	And the children of Israel did according to all
c13931	that the LORD commanded Moses,
c13932	so did they.
c13933	And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron,
c13934	saying,
c13935	Every man of the children of Israel shall pitch by his own standard, with the ensign of their father's house:
c13937	far off about the tabernacle of the congregation shall they pitch.
c13939	And on the east side toward the rising of the sun shall they of the standard of the camp of Judah pitch
c13940	throughout their armies:
c13941	and Nahshon the son of Amminadab <i>shall be</i> captain of the children of Judah.
c13942	And his host, and those that were numbered of them, <i>were</i> threescore and fourteen thousand and six hundred.

c13966	Then the tabernacle of the congregation shall set forward with the camp of the Levites in the midst of the camp:
c13967	as they encamp,
c13968	so shall they set forward,
c13969	every man in his place by their standards.
c13970	On the west side <i>shall be</i> the standard of the camp of Ephraim according to their armies:

c13972	And his host, and those that were numbered of them, <i>were</i> forty thousand and five hundred.
c13973	And by him <i>shall be</i> the tribe of Manasseh:
c13974	and the captain of the children of Manasseh <i>shall be</i> Gamaliel the son of Pedahzur.
c13975	And his host, and those that were numbered of them, <i>were</i> thirty and two thousand and two hundred.
c13976	Then the tribe of Benjamin:
c13977	and the captain of the sons of Benjamin <i>shall be</i> Abidan the son of Gideoni.
c13978	And his host, and those that were numbered of them, <i>were</i> thirty and five thousand and four hundred.
c13979	All that were numbered of the camp of Ephraim <i>were</i> an hundred thousand and eight thousand and an hundred, throughout their armies.
c13980	And they shall go forward in the third rank.

c13994	These <i>are</i> those which were numbered of the children of Israel by the house of their fathers:
c13995	all those that were numbered of the camps throughout their hosts <i>were</i> six hundred thousand and three thousand and five hundred and fifty.
c13996	But the Levites were not numbered among the children of Israel;
c13997	as the LORD commanded Moses.
c13998	And the children of Israel did according to all
c13999	that the LORD commanded Moses:
c14000	so they pitched by their standards,
c14001	and so they set forward,
c14002	every one after their families, according to the house of their fathers.
c14003	These also <i>are</i> the generations of Aaron and Moses in the day
c14004	<i>that</i> the LORD spake with Moses in mount Sinai.
c14005	And these <i>are</i> the names of the sons of Aaron;
c14006	Nadab the firstborn,
c14007	and Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar.
c14008	These <i>are</i> the names of the sons of Aaron, the priests which were anointed,
c14009	whom he consecrated
c14010	to minister in the priest's office.
c14011	And Nadab and Abihu died before the LORD,
c14012	when they offered strange fire before the LORD, in the wilderness of Sinai,
c14013	and they had no children:
c14014	and Eleazar and Ithamar ministered in the priest's office in the sight of Aaron their father.
c14015	And the LORD spake unto Moses,
c14016	saying,
c14017	Bring the tribe of Levi near,
c14018	and present them before Aaron the priest,
c14019	that they may minister unto him.
c14020	And they shall keep his charge, and the charge of the whole congregation before the tabernacle of the congregation,
c14021	to do the service of the tabernacle.
c14022	And they shall keep all the instruments of the tabernacle of the congregation, and the charge of the children of Israel,
c14023	to do the service of the tabernacle.
c14024	And thou shalt give the Levites unto Aaron and to his sons:
c14026	they <i>are</i> wholly given unto him out of the children of Israel.
c14027	And thou shalt appoint Aaron and his sons,
c14028	and they shall wait on their priest's office:
c14029	and the stranger that cometh nigh shall be put to death.
c14030	And the LORD spake unto Moses,
c14031	saying,
c14032	And I,
c14033	behold, I have taken the Levites from among the children of Israel instead of all the firstborn that openeth the matrix among the children of Israel:
c14034	therefore the Levites shall be mine;
c14035	Because all the firstborn
c14036	<i>are</i> mine; <i>for</i> on the day
c14037	that I smote all the firstborn in the land of Egypt
c14038	I hallowed unto me all the firstborn in Israel, both man and beast:
c14039	mine shall they be:
c14040	I <i>am</i> the LORD.
c14041	And the LORD spake unto Moses in the wilderness of Sinai,
c14042	saying,
c14043	Number the children of Levi after the house of their fathers, by their families:
c14044	every male from a month old and upward
c14045	shalt thou number them.
c14046	And Moses numbered them according to the word of the LORD,
c14047	as he was commanded.
c14048	And these were the sons of Levi by their names;
c14049	Gershon, and Kohath, and Merari.
c14050	And these <i>are</i> the names of the sons of Gershon by their families;
c14051	Libni, and Shimei.

c14061	Those that were numbered of them, according to the number of all the males, from a month old and upward,

c14069	And of Kohath <i>was</i> the family of the Amramites, and the family of the Izeharites, and the family of the Hebronites, and the family of the Uzzielites:
c14070	these
c14071	<i>are</i> the families of the Kohathites.
c14072	In the number of all the males, from a month old and upward, <i>were</i> eight thousand and six hundred, keeping the charge of the sanctuary.
c14073	The families of the sons of Kohath shall pitch on the side of the tabernacle southward.
c14074	And the chief of the house of the father of the families of the Kohathites <i>shall be</i> Elizaphan the son of Uzziel.
c14075	And their charge <i>shall be</i> the ark, and the table, and the candlestick, and the altars, and the vessels of the sanctuary

c14078	And Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest <i>shall be</i> chief over the chief of the Levites,
c14079	<i>and have</i> the oversight of them that keep the charge of the sanctuary.
c14080	Of Merari <i>was</i> the family of the Mahlites, and the family of the Mushites:

c14083	And those that were numbered of them, according to the number of all the males, from a month old and upward, <i>were</i> six thousand and two hundred.
c14084	And the chief of the house of the father of the families of Merari <i>was</i> Zuriel the son of Abihail:
c14085	<i>these</i> shall pitch on the side of the tabernacle northward.
c14086	And <i>under</i> the custody and charge of the sons of Merari <i>shall be</i> the boards of the tabernacle, and the bars thereof, and the pillars thereof, and the sockets thereof, and all the vessels thereof, and all that serveth thereto,
c14087	And the pillars of the court round about, and their sockets, and their pins, and their cords.
c14089	But those that encamp before the tabernacle toward the east, <i>even</i> before the tabernacle of the congregation eastward,
c14090	<i>shall be</i> Moses, and Aaron and his sons,
c14091	keeping the charge of the sanctuary for the charge of the children of Israel;
c14092	and the stranger that cometh nigh shall be put to death.
c14093	All that were numbered of the Levites,
c14094	which Moses and Aaron numbered at the commandment of the LORD, throughout their families,
c14095	all the males from a month old and upward, <i>were</i> twenty and two thousand.
c14096	And the LORD said unto Moses,
c14097	Number all the firstborn of the males of the children of Israel from a month old and upward,
c14098	and take the number of their names.
c14099	And thou shalt take the Levites
c14100	for me (I <i>am</i> the LORD)
c14101	instead of all the firstborn among the children of Israel;
c14102	and the cattle of the Levites instead of all the firstlings among the cattle of the children of Israel.
c14103	And Moses numbered,
c14104	as the LORD commanded
c14105	him, all the firstborn among the children of Israel.
c14106	And all the firstborn males by the number of names, from a month old and upward, of those that were numbered of them, were twenty and two thousand two hundred and threescore and thirteen.
c14107	And the LORD spake unto Moses,
c14108	saying,
c14109	Take the Levites instead of all the firstborn among the children of Israel,
c14110	and the cattle of the Levites instead of their cattle;
c14111	and the Levites shall be
c14112	mine: I <i>am</i> the LORD.
c14113	And for those that are to be redeemed of the two hundred and threescore and thirteen
c14114	of the firstborn of the children of Israel, which are more than the Levites;
c14115	Thou shalt even take five shekels apiece by the poll,
c14116	after the shekel of the sanctuary shalt thou take
c14117	<i>them:</i> (the shekel <i>is</i> twenty gerahs:)
c14118	And thou shalt give the money, wherewith the odd number of them is to be redeemed, unto Aaron and to his sons.
c14120	And Moses took the redemption money
c14121	of them that were over and above them that were redeemed by the Levites:
c14122	Of the firstborn of the children of Israel took he the money; a thousand three hundred and threescore and five <i>shekels,</i> after the shekel of the sanctuary:
c14123	And Moses gave the money of them that were redeemed unto Aaron and to his sons, according to the word of the LORD,
c14124	as the LORD commanded Moses.
c14125	And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron,
c14126	saying,
c14127	Take the sum of the sons of Kohath from among the sons of Levi, after their families, by the house of their fathers,
c14128	From thirty years old and upward even until fifty years old, all
c14129	that enter into the host,
c14130	to do the work in the tabernacle of the congregation.
c14131	This <i>shall be</i> the service of the sons of Kohath in the tabernacle of the congregation, <i>about</i> the most holy things:
c14132	Aaron shall come, and his sons,
c14133	And when the camp setteth forward,
c14134	and they shall take down the covering vail,
c14135	and cover the ark of testimony with it:
c14136	And shall put thereon the covering of badgers' skins,
c14137	and shall spread over <i>it</i> a cloth wholly of blue,
c14138	and shall put in the staves thereof.
c14139	And upon the table of shewbread they shall spread a cloth of blue,
c14140	and put thereon the dishes, and the spoons, and the bowls, and covers to cover
c14141	withal: and the continual bread shall be thereon:
c14142	And they shall spread upon them a cloth of scarlet,
c14143	and cover the same with a covering of badgers' skins,
c14144	and shall put in the staves thereof.
c14145	And they shall take a cloth of blue,
c14146	and cover the candlestick of the light, and his lamps, and his tongs, and his snuffdishes, and all the oil vessels
c14147	thereof, wherewith they minister unto it:
c14148	And they shall put it and all the vessels thereof within a covering of badgers' skins,
c14149	and shall put <i>it</i> upon a bar.
c14150	And upon the golden altar they shall spread a cloth of blue,
c14151	and cover it with a covering of badgers' skins,
c14152	and shall put to the staves thereof:
c14153	And they shall take all the instruments of ministry,
c14154	wherewith they minister in the sanctuary,
c14155	and put <i>them</i> in a cloth of blue,
c14156	and cover them with a covering of badgers' skins,
c14157	and shall put <i>them</i> on a bar:
c14158	And they shall take away the ashes from the altar,
c14159	and spread a purple cloth thereon:
c14160	And they shall put upon it all the vessels
c14161	thereof, wherewith they minister about
c14162	it, <i>even</i> the censers, the fleshhooks, and the shovels, and the basons, all the vessels of the altar;
c14163	and they shall spread upon it a covering of badgers' skins,
c14164	and put to the staves of it.
c14165	And when Aaron and his sons have made an end
c14166	of covering the sanctuary, and all the vessels of the sanctuary,
c14167	as the camp is to set forward;
c14168	after that, the sons of Kohath shall come
c14169	to bear
c14170	<i>it:</i> but they shall not touch <i>any</i> holy thing,
c14171	lest they die.
c14172	These <i>things are</i> the burden of the sons of Kohath in the tabernacle of the congregation.
c14173	And to the office of Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest <i>pertaineth</i> the oil for the light, and the sweet incense, and the daily meat offering, and the anointing oil, <i>and</i> the oversight of all the tabernacle, and of all
c14174	that therein <i>is,</i> in the sanctuary, and in the vessels thereof.
c14175	And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron,
c14176	saying,
c14177	Cut ye not off the tribe of the families of the Kohathites from among the Levites:
c14178	But thus do
c14179	unto them, that they may live,
c14180	and not die,
c14181	when they approach unto the most holy things:
c14182	Aaron and his sons shall go in,
c14183	and appoint
c14184	them every one to his service and to his burden:
c14185	But they shall not go in
c14186	to see
c14187	when the holy things are covered,
c14188	lest they die.
c14189	And the LORD spake unto Moses,
c14190	saying,
c14191	Take also the sum of the sons of Gershon, throughout the houses of their fathers, by their families;
c14192	From thirty years old and upward until fifty years old shalt thou number them; all
c14193	that enter in
c14194	to perform the service, to do the work
c14195	in the tabernacle of the congregation.
c14196	This <i>is</i> the service of the families of the Gershonites,
c14197	to serve,
c14198	and for burdens:
c14199	And they shall bear the curtains of the tabernacle, and the tabernacle of the congregation, his covering, and the covering of the badgers' skins
c14200	that <i>is</i> above upon
c14201	it, and the hanging for the door of the tabernacle of the congregation,
c14202	And the hangings of the court, and the hanging for the door of the gate of the court,
c14203	which <i>is</i> by the tabernacle and by the altar round about,
c14204	and their cords, and all the instruments of their service, and all
c14205	that is made
c14206	for them: so shall they serve.
c14207	At the appointment of Aaron and his sons shall be all the service of the sons of the Gershonites, in all their burdens, and in all their service:
c14208	and ye shall appoint unto them in charge all their burdens.
c14209	This <i>is</i> the service of the families of the sons of Gershon in the tabernacle of the congregation:
c14210	and their charge <i>shall be</i> under the hand of Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest.
c14211	As for the sons of Merari,
c14212	thou shalt number them after their families, by the house of their fathers;
c14213	From thirty years old and upward even unto fifty years old shalt thou number them, every one
c14214	that entereth into the service,
c14215	to do the work of the tabernacle of the congregation.
c14216	And this <i>is</i> the charge of their burden, according to all their service in the tabernacle of the congregation;
c14217	the boards of the tabernacle, and the bars thereof, and the pillars thereof, and sockets thereof,
c14218	And the pillars of the court round about,

c14255	that they put out of the camp every leper, and every one that hath an issue, and whosoever
c14256	is defiled by the dead:
c14257	Both male and female shall ye put out,
c14258	without the camp shall ye put
c14259	them; that they defile not their camps,
c14260	in the midst whereof I dwell.
c14261	And the children of Israel did so,
c14262	and put them out without the camp:
c14263	as the LORD spake unto Moses,
c14264	so did the children of Israel.
c14265	And the LORD spake unto Moses,
c14266	saying,
c14267	Speak unto the children of Israel,
c14269	When a man or woman shall commit any sin that men
c14270	commit, to do a trespass against the LORD,
c14271	and that person be guilty;
c14272	Then they shall confess their sin
c14273	which they have done:
c14274	and he shall recompense his trespass with the principal
c14275	thereof, and add unto it the fifth
c14276	<i>part</i> thereof, and give
c14277	<i>it</i> unto <i>him</i> against whom he hath trespassed.
c14278	But if the man have no kinsman
c14279	to recompense the trespass unto,
c14280	let the trespass
c14281	be recompensed
c14282	unto the LORD,
c14283	<i>even</i> to the priest; beside the ram of the atonement,
c14284	whereby an atonement shall be made for him.
c14285	And every offering of all the holy things of the children of Israel,
c14286	which they bring unto the priest,
c14287	shall be his.
c14288	And every man's
c14289	hallowed things shall be
c14291	his: whatsoever any man giveth the priest,
c14292	it shall be his.
c14293	And the LORD spake unto Moses,
c14294	saying,
c14295	Speak unto the children of Israel,
c14296	and say unto
c14298	them, If any man's wife go aside,
c14299	and commit a trespass against him,
c14300	And a man lie with her carnally,
c14301	and it be hid from the eyes of her husband,
c14302	and be kept close,
c14303	and she be defiled,
c14304	and <i>there be</i> no witness
c14305	against her, neither she be taken <i>with the manner;</i>
c14306	And the spirit of jealousy come upon
c14307	him, and he be jealous of his wife,
c14308	and she be defiled:
c14309	or if the spirit of jealousy come upon
c14310	him, and he be jealous of his wife,
c14311	and she be not defiled:
c14312	Then shall the man bring his wife unto the priest,
c14313	and he shall bring her offering for her, the tenth <i>part</i> of an ephah of barley meal;
c14314	he shall pour no oil upon
c14315	it, nor put frankincense thereon;
c14316	for it <i>is</i> an offering of jealousy,
c14317	an offering of memorial,
c14318	bringing iniquity to remembrance.
c14319	And the priest shall bring her near,
c14320	and set her before the LORD:
c14321	And the priest shall take holy water in an earthen vessel;
c14322	and of the dust
c14323	that is in the floor of the tabernacle
c14324	the priest shall take,
c14325	and put <i>it</i> into the water:
c14326	And the priest shall set the woman before the LORD,
c14327	and uncover the woman's head,
c14328	and put the offering of memorial in her hands,
c14329	which <i>is</i> the jealousy offering:
c14330	and the priest shall have in his hand the bitter water that causeth the curse:
c14331	And the priest shall charge her by an oath,
c14332	and say unto the woman,
c14333	If no man have lain with
c14334	thee, and if thou hast not gone aside to uncleanness <i>with another</i> instead of thy husband,
c14335	be thou free from this bitter water that causeth the curse:
c14337	But if thou hast gone aside <i>to another</i> instead of thy husband,
c14338	and if thou be defiled,
c14339	and some man have lain with thee beside thine husband:
c14340	Then the priest shall charge the woman with an oath of cursing,
c14341	and the priest shall say unto the woman,
c14342	The LORD make thee a curse and an oath among thy people,
c14343	when the LORD doth make thy thigh to rot,
c14344	and thy belly to swell;
c14345	And this water that causeth the curse shall go into thy bowels,
c14346	to make <i>thy</i> belly to swell,
c14347	and <i>thy</i> thigh to rot:
c14348	And the woman shall say,
c14349	Amen, amen.
c14350	And the priest shall write these curses in a book,
c14351	and he shall blot <i>them</i> out with the bitter water:
c14352	And he shall cause the woman to drink the bitter water that causeth the curse:
c14353	and the water that causeth the curse shall enter into her, <i>and become</i> bitter.
c14354	Then the priest shall take the jealousy offering out of the woman's hand,
c14355	and shall wave the offering before the LORD,
c14356	and offer it upon the altar:
c14357	And the priest shall take an handful of the offering, <i>even</i> the memorial
c14358	thereof, and burn <i>it</i> upon the altar,
c14359	and afterward shall cause the woman to drink the water.
c14360	And when he hath made her to drink the water,
c14361	then it shall come to pass,
c14362	<i>that,</i> if she be defiled,
c14363	and have done trespass against her husband,
c14364	that the water that causeth the curse shall enter into her, <i>and become</i> bitter,
c14365	and her belly shall swell,
c14366	and her thigh shall rot:
c14367	and the woman shall be a curse among her people.
c14368	And if the woman be not defiled,
c14369	but be clean;
c14370	then she shall be free,
c14371	and shall conceive seed.
c14372	This <i>is</i> the law of jealousies,
c14373	when a wife goeth aside <i>to another</i> instead of her husband,
c14374	and is defiled;
c14375	Or
c14376	when the spirit of jealousy cometh upon
c14377	him, and he be jealous over his wife,
c14378	and shall set the woman before the LORD,
c14379	and the priest shall execute upon her all this law.
c14380	Then shall the man be guiltless from iniquity,
c14381	and this woman shall bear her iniquity.
c14382	And the LORD spake unto Moses,
c14383	saying,
c14384	Speak unto the children of Israel,
c14385	and say unto
c14387	them, When either man or woman shall separate
c14388	<i>themselves</i> to vow a vow of a Nazarite,
c14389	to separate <i>themselves</i> unto the LORD:
c14390	He shall separate <i>himself</i> from wine and strong drink,
c14391	and shall drink no vinegar of wine, or vinegar of strong drink,
c14392	neither shall he drink any liquor of grapes,
c14393	nor eat moist grapes, or dried.
c14394	All the days of his separation
c14395	that is made of the vine tree, from the kernels even to the husk.
c14396	shall he eat nothing
c14397	All the days of the vow of his separation there shall no razor come upon his head:
c14398	until the days be fulfilled,
c14399	in the which he separateth <i>himself</i> unto the LORD,
c14400	he shall be holy,
c14401	<i>and</i> shall let the locks of the hair of his head grow.
c14402	All the days
c14403	that he separateth <i>himself</i> unto the LORD
c14404	he shall come at no dead body.
c14406	He shall not make himself unclean for his father, or for his mother, for his brother, or for his sister, when they die:
c14407	because the consecration of his God <i>is</i> upon his head.
c14408	All the days of his separation he <i>is</i> holy unto the LORD.
c14409	And if any man die very suddenly by
c14410	him, and he hath defiled the head of his consecration;
c14411	then he shall shave his head in the day of his cleansing,
c14412	on the seventh day shall he shave it.
c14413	And on the eighth day he shall bring two turtles, or two young pigeons, to the priest, to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation:
c14414	And the priest shall offer the one for a sin offering,
c14415	and the other for a burnt offering,
c14416	and make an atonement for
c14417	him, for that he sinned by the dead,
c14418	and shall hallow his head that same day.
c14419	And he shall consecrate unto the LORD the days of his separation,
c14420	and shall bring a lamb of the first year for a trespass offering:
c14421	but the days that were before shall be lost,
c14422	because his separation was defiled.
c14423	And this <i>is</i> the law of the Nazarite,
c14424	when
c14425	the days of his separation are fulfilled:
c14426	he shall be brought unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation:
c14427	And he shall offer his offering unto the LORD,
c14428	one he lamb of the first year without blemish for a burnt offering,
c14429	and one ewe lamb of the first year without blemish for a sin offering,
c14430	and one ram without blemish for peace offerings,
c14431	And a basket of unleavened bread,
c14432	cakes of fine flour
c14433	mingled with oil,
c14434	and wafers of unleavened bread
c14435	anointed with oil,
c14436	and their meat offering, and their drink offerings.
c14437	And the priest shall bring <i>them</i> before the LORD,
c14438	and shall offer his sin offering, and his burnt offering:
c14439	And he shall offer the ram <i>for</i> a sacrifice of peace offerings unto the LORD, with the basket of unleavened bread:
c14440	the priest shall offer also his meat offering, and his drink offering.
c14441	And the Nazarite shall shave the head of his separation <i>at</i> the door of the tabernacle of the congregation,
c14442	and shall take the hair of the head of his separation,
c14443	and put <i>it</i> in the fire
c14444	which <i>is</i> under the sacrifice of the peace offerings.
c14445	And the priest shall take the sodden shoulder of the ram,
c14446	and one unleavened cake out of the basket,
c14447	and one unleavened wafer,
c14448	and shall put <i>them</i> upon the hands of the Nazarite,
c14449	after <i>the hair of</i> his separation is shaven:
c14450	And the priest shall wave them <i>for</i> a wave offering before the LORD:
c14451	this <i>is</i> holy for the priest, with the wave breast and heave shoulder:
c14452	and after that the Nazarite may drink wine.
c14453	This <i>is</i> the law of the Nazarite
c14454	who hath vowed, <i>and of</i> his offering unto the LORD for his separation,
c14455	beside <i>that</i> that his hand shall get:
c14456	according to the vow
c14457	which he vowed,
c14458	so he must do after the law of his separation.
c14459	And the LORD spake unto Moses,
c14460	saying,
c14461	Speak unto Aaron and unto his sons,
c14462	saying,
c14463	On this wise ye shall bless the children of Israel,
c14464	saying unto them,
c14465	The LORD bless
c14466	thee, and keep thee:
c14467	The LORD make his face shine upon
c14468	thee, and be gracious unto thee:
c14469	The LORD lift up his countenance upon
c14470	thee, and give thee peace.
c14471	And they shall put my name upon the children of Israel;
c14472	and I will bless them.
c14473	And it came to pass on the day
c14474	that Moses had fully
c14475	set up the tabernacle,
c14476	and had anointed
c14477	it, and sanctified it, and all the instruments thereof, both the altar and all the vessels
c14478	thereof, and had anointed
c14479	them, and sanctified them;
c14480	That the princes of Israel, heads of the house of their fathers, who <i>were</i> the princes of the tribes,
c14483	and were over them that were numbered, offered:
c14484	And they brought their offering before the LORD, six covered wagons, and twelve oxen;
c14485	a wagon for two of the princes,
c14486	and for each one an ox:
c14487	and they brought them before the tabernacle.
c14488	And the LORD spake unto Moses,
c14489	saying,
c14490	Take <i>it</i> of
c14491	them, that they may be
c14492	to do the service of the tabernacle of the congregation;
c14493	and thou shalt give them unto the Levites,
c14494	to every man according to his service.
c14495	And Moses took the wagons and the oxen,
c14496	and gave them unto the Levites.
c14497	Two wagons and four oxen he gave unto the sons of Gershon, according to their service:
c14498	And four wagons and eight oxen he gave unto the sons of Merari, according unto their service, under the hand of Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest.
c14499	But unto the sons of Kohath he gave none:
c14500	because the service of the sanctuary belonging unto
c14501	them <i>was that</i> they should bear upon their shoulders.
c14502	And the princes offered for dedicating of the altar in the day
c14503	that it was anointed,
c14504	even the princes offered their offering before the altar.
c14505	And the LORD said unto Moses,
c14506	They shall offer their offering, each prince on his day, for the dedicating of the altar.

c14672	full of incense,
c14673	<i>weighing</i> ten <i>shekels</i> apiece, after the shekel of the sanctuary:
c14674	all the gold of the spoons <i>was</i> an hundred and twenty <i>shekels.</i>
c14675	All the oxen for the burnt offering <i>were</i> twelve bullocks, the rams twelve, the lambs of the first year twelve, with their meat offering:
c14676	and the kids of the goats for sin offering twelve.
c14677	And all the oxen for the sacrifice of the peace offerings <i>were</i> twenty and four bullocks, the rams sixty, the he goats sixty, the lambs of the first year sixty.
c14678	This <i>was</i> the dedication of the altar,
c14679	after that it was anointed.
c14680	And when Moses was gone into the tabernacle of the congregation
c14681	to speak with
c14682	him, then he heard the voice
c14683	of one speaking unto him from off the mercy seat
c14684	that <i>was</i> upon the ark of testimony,
c14685	from between the two cherubims:
c14686	and he spake unto him.
c14687	And the LORD spake unto Moses,
c14688	saying,
c14689	Speak unto Aaron,
c14690	and say unto
c14691	him, When thou lightest the lamps,
c14692	the seven lamps shall give light over against the candlestick.
c14693	And Aaron did so;
c14694	he lighted the lamps thereof over against the candlestick,
c14695	as the LORD commanded Moses.
c14696	And this work of the candlestick
c14697	<i>was of</i> beaten gold,
c14698	unto the shaft thereof, unto the flowers thereof, <i>was</i> beaten work:
c14699	according unto the pattern
c14700	which the LORD had shewed Moses,
c14701	so he made the candlestick.
c14702	And the LORD spake unto Moses,
c14703	saying,
c14704	Take the Levites from among the children of Israel,
c14705	and cleanse them.
c14706	And thus shalt thou do
c14707	unto them, to cleanse
c14708	them: Sprinkle water of purifying upon
c14709	them, and let them shave all their flesh,
c14710	and let them wash their clothes,
c14711	and <i>so</i> make themselves clean.
c14712	Then let them take a young bullock
c14713	with his meat offering, <i>even</i> fine flour
c14714	mingled with oil,
c14715	and another young bullock shalt thou take for a sin offering.
c14716	And thou shalt bring the Levites before the tabernacle of the congregation:
c14717	and thou shalt gather the whole assembly of the children of Israel together:
c14718	And thou shalt bring the Levites before the LORD:
c14719	and the children of Israel shall put their hands upon the Levites:
c14720	And Aaron shall offer the Levites before the LORD <i>for</i> an offering of the children of Israel,
c14721	that they may execute
c14722	the service of the LORD.
c14723	And the Levites shall lay their hands upon the heads of the bullocks:
c14724	and thou shalt offer the one <i>for</i> a sin offering,
c14725	and the other <i>for</i> a burnt offering, unto the LORD,
c14726	to make an atonement for the Levites.
c14727	And thou shalt set the Levites before Aaron, and before his sons,
c14728	and offer them <i>for</i> an offering unto the LORD.
c14729	Thus shalt thou separate the Levites from among the children of Israel:
c14730	and the Levites shall be mine.
c14731	And after that shall the Levites go in
c14732	to do the service of the tabernacle of the congregation:
c14733	and thou shalt cleanse
c14734	them, and offer them <i>for</i> an offering.
c14735	For they <i>are</i> wholly given
c14736	unto me from among the children of Israel;
c14737	instead of such as open every womb, <i>even instead of</i> the firstborn of all the children of Israel, have I taken them unto me.
c14738	For all the firstborn of the children of Israel <i>are</i> mine, <i>both</i> man and beast:
c14739	on the day
c14740	that I smote every firstborn in the land of Egypt
c14741	I sanctified them for myself.
c14742	And I have taken the Levites for all the firstborn of the children of Israel.
c14743	And I have given the Levites <i>as</i> a gift to Aaron and to his sons from among the children of Israel,
c14744	to do the service of the children of Israel in the tabernacle of the congregation,
c14745	and to make an atonement for the children of Israel:
c14746	that there be no plague among the children of Israel,
c14747	when the children of Israel come nigh unto the sanctuary.
c14748	And Moses, and Aaron, and all the congregation of the children of Israel, did to the Levites according unto all
c14749	that the LORD commanded Moses concerning the Levites,
c14750	so did the children of Israel unto them.
c14751	And the Levites were purified,
c14752	and they washed their clothes;
c14753	and Aaron offered them <i>as</i> an offering before the LORD;
c14754	and Aaron made an atonement for
c14755	them to cleanse them.
c14756	And after that went the Levites in
c14757	to do their service in the tabernacle of the congregation before Aaron, and before his sons:
c14758	as the LORD had commanded Moses concerning the Levites,
c14759	so did they unto them.
c14760	And the LORD spake unto Moses,
c14761	saying,
c14762	This
c14763	<i>is it</i> that <i>belongeth</i> unto the Levites:
c14764	from twenty and five years old and upward they shall go in
c14765	to wait upon the service of the tabernacle of the congregation:
c14766	And from the age of fifty years they shall cease waiting upon the service
c14767	<i>thereof,</i> and shall serve no more:
c14768	But shall minister with their brethren in the tabernacle of the congregation,
c14769	to keep the charge,
c14770	and shall do no service.
c14771	Thus shalt thou do unto the Levites touching their charge.
c14772	And the LORD spake unto Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, in the first month of the second year
c14773	after they were come out of the land of Egypt,
c14775	saying,
c14776	Let the children of Israel also keep the passover at his appointed season.
c14777	In the fourteenth day of this month, at even, ye shall keep it in his appointed season:
c14778	according to all the rites of it, and according to all the ceremonies thereof, shall ye keep it.
c14779	And Moses spake unto the children of Israel,
c14780	that they should keep the passover.
c14781	And they kept the passover on the fourteenth day of the first month at even in the wilderness of Sinai: according to all
c14782	that the LORD commanded Moses,
c14783	so did the children of Israel.
c14784	And there were
c14785	certain men,
c14786	who were defiled by the dead body of a man,
c14787	that they could not
c14788	keep the passover on that day:
c14789	and they came before Moses and before Aaron on that day:
c14790	And those men said unto
c14791	him, We <i>are</i> defiled by the dead body of a man:
c14792	wherefore are we kept back,
c14793	that we may not offer an offering of the LORD in his appointed season among the children of Israel?
c14794	And Moses said unto
c14795	them, Stand still,
c14796	and I will hear
c14797	what the LORD will command concerning you.
c14798	And the LORD spake unto Moses,
c14799	saying,
c14800	Speak unto the children of Israel,
c14801	saying,
c14803	If any man
c14804	of you or of your posterity shall be unclean by reason of a dead body,
c14805	or <i>be</i> in a journey afar off,
c14806	yet he shall keep the passover unto the LORD.
c14807	The fourteenth day of the second month at even they shall keep
c14808	it, <i>and</i> eat it with unleavened bread and bitter <i>herbs.</i>
c14809	They shall leave none of it unto the morning,
c14810	nor break any bone
c14811	of it: according to all the ordinances of the passover they shall keep it.
c14812	But the man
c14813	that <i>is</i> clean, and is not in a journey,
c14815	and forbeareth
c14816	to keep the passover, even the same
c14817	soul shall be cut off from among his people: because he brought not the offering of the LORD in his appointed season, that
c14819	man shall bear his sin.
c14820	And if a stranger shall sojourn among
c14821	you, and will keep the passover unto the LORD;
c14822	according to the ordinance of the passover, and according to the manner thereof, so shall he do:
c14823	ye shall have one ordinance, both for the stranger, and for him that was born in the land.
c14824	And on the day
c14825	that the tabernacle was reared up
c14826	the cloud covered the tabernacle, <i>namely,</i> the tent of the testimony:
c14827	and at even there was upon the tabernacle as it were the appearance of fire, until the morning.
c14828	So it was alway:
c14829	the cloud covered
c14830	it <i>by day,</i> and the appearance of fire by night.
c14831	And when
c14832	the cloud was taken up from the tabernacle,
c14833	then after that the children of Israel journeyed:
c14834	and in the place
c14835	where the cloud abode, there
c14836	the children of Israel pitched their tents.
c14837	At the commandment of the LORD the children of Israel journeyed,
c14838	and at the commandment of the LORD they pitched:
c14839	as long as
c14840	the cloud abode upon the tabernacle
c14841	they rested in their tents.
c14842	And when the cloud tarried long upon the tabernacle many days,
c14843	then the children of Israel kept the charge of the LORD,
c14844	and journeyed not.
c14845	And <i>so</i> it was,
c14846	when the cloud was a few days upon the tabernacle;
c14847	according to the commandment of the LORD they abode in their tents,
c14848	and according to the commandment of the LORD they journeyed.
c14849	And <i>so</i> it was,
c14850	when the cloud abode from even unto the morning,
c14851	and <i>that</i> the cloud was taken up in the morning,
c14852	then they journeyed:
c14853	whether <i>it was</i> by day or by night
c14854	that the cloud was taken up,
c14855	they journeyed.
c14856	Or <i>whether it were</i> two days, or a month, or a year,
c14857	that the cloud tarried upon the tabernacle,
c14858	remaining thereon,
c14859	the children of Israel abode in their tents,
c14860	and journeyed not:
c14862	but when it was taken up,
c14863	they journeyed.
c14864	At the commandment of the LORD they rested in the tents,
c14865	and at the commandment of the LORD they journeyed:
c14866	they kept the charge of the LORD, at the commandment of the LORD by the hand of Moses.
c14867	And the LORD spake unto Moses,
c14868	saying,
c14869	Make thee two trumpets of silver;
c14870	of a whole piece shalt thou make
c14871	them: that thou mayest use them for the calling of the assembly, and for the journeying of the camps.
c14872	And when they shall blow
c14873	with them, all the assembly shall assemble themselves to thee at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.
c14874	And if they blow <i>but</i> with one
c14875	<i>trumpet,</i> then the princes, <i>which are</i> heads of the thousands of Israel, shall gather themselves unto thee.
c14876	When ye blow an alarm,
c14877	then the camps that lie on the east parts shall go forward.
c14879	When ye blow an alarm the second time,
c14880	then the camps that lie on the south side shall take their journey:
c14882	they shall blow an alarm for their journeys.
c14884	But when the congregation is to be gathered together,
c14885	ye shall blow,
c14886	but ye shall not sound an alarm.
c14887	And the sons of Aaron, the priests, shall blow with the trumpets;
c14888	and they shall be to you for an ordinance for ever throughout your generations.
c14889	And if ye go to war in your land against the enemy
c14890	that oppresseth
c14891	you, then ye shall blow an alarm with the trumpets;
c14892	and ye shall be remembered before the LORD your God,
c14893	and ye shall be saved from your enemies.
c14894	Also in the day of your gladness, and in your solemn days, and in the beginnings of your months,
c14895	ye shall blow with the trumpets over your burnt offerings, and over the sacrifices of your peace offerings;
c14896	that they may be to you for a memorial before your God:
c14897	I <i>am</i> the LORD your God.
c14898	And it came to pass on the twentieth <i>day</i> of the second month, in the second year,
c14899	that the cloud was taken up from off the tabernacle of the testimony.
c14900	And the children of Israel took their journeys out of the wilderness of Sinai;
c14901	and the cloud rested in the wilderness of Paran.
c14902	And they first took their journey according to the commandment of the LORD by the hand of Moses.
c14903	In the first <i>place</i> went the standard of the camp of the children of Judah according to their armies:
c14904	and over his host <i>was</i> Nahshon the son of Amminadab.
c14905	And over the host of the tribe of the children of Issachar <i>was</i> Nethaneel the son of Zuar.
c14906	And over the host of the tribe of the children of Zebulun <i>was</i> Eliab the son of Helon.
c14907	And the tabernacle was taken down;
c14908	and the sons of Gershon and the sons of Merari set forward, bearing the tabernacle.
c14909	And the standard of the camp of Reuben set forward according to their armies:
c14910	and over his host <i>was</i> Elizur the son of Shedeur.
c14911	And over the host of the tribe of the children of Simeon <i>was</i> Shelumiel the son of Zurishaddai.
c14912	And over the host of the tribe of the children of Gad <i>was</i> Eliasaph the son of Deuel.
c14913	And the Kohathites set forward, bearing the sanctuary:
c14914	and <i>the other</i> did set up the tabernacle
c14915	against they came.
c14916	And the standard of the camp of the children of Ephraim set forward according to their armies:
c14917	and over his host <i>was</i> Elishama the son of Ammihud.
c14918	And over the host of the tribe of the children of Manasseh <i>was</i> Gamaliel the son of Pedahzur.
c14919	And over the host of the tribe of the children of Benjamin <i>was</i> Abidan the son of Gideoni.
c14920	And the standard of the camp of the children of Dan set forward,
c14921	<i>which was</i> the rereward of all the camps
c14922	throughout their hosts:
c14923	and over his host <i>was</i> Ahiezer the son of Ammishaddai.
c14924	And over the host of the tribe of the children of Asher <i>was</i> Pagiel the son of Ocran.
c14925	And over the host of the tribe of the children of Naphtali <i>was</i> Ahira the son of Enan.
c14926	Thus <i>were</i> the journeyings of the children of Israel according to their armies,
c14927	when they set forward.
c14928	And Moses said unto Hobab, the son of Raguel the Midianite, Moses' father in law,
c14929	We are journeying unto the place
c14930	of which the LORD said,
c14931	I will give
c14932	it you: come thou with
c14933	us, and we will do thee good:
c14934	for the LORD hath spoken good concerning Israel.
c14935	And he said unto
c14936	him, I will not go;
c14937	but I will depart to mine own land, and to my kindred.
c14938	And he said,
c14939	Leave us not, I pray thee;
c14940	forasmuch as thou knowest
c14941	how we are to encamp in the wilderness,
c14942	and thou mayest be to us instead of eyes.
c14943	And it shall be,
c14944	if thou go with
c14945	us, yea, it shall be, that what goodness
c14946	the LORD shall do unto
c14947	us, the same will we do unto thee.
c14948	And they departed from the mount of the LORD three days' journey:
c14949	and the ark of the covenant of the LORD went before them in the three days' journey,
c14950	to search out a resting place for them.
c14951	And the cloud of the LORD <i>was</i> upon them by day,
c14952	when they went out of the camp.
c14953	And it came to pass,
c14954	when the ark set forward,
c14955	that Moses said,
c14956	Rise up,
c14957	LORD,
c14958	and let thine enemies be scattered;
c14959	and let them that hate thee flee before thee.
c14961	And when it rested,
c14962	he said,
c14963	Return,
c14964	O LORD,
c14965	unto the many thousands of Israel.
c14967	And <i>when</i> the people complained, it displeased the LORD:
c14968	and the LORD heard
c14969	<i>it;</i> and his anger was kindled;
c14970	and the fire of the LORD burnt
c14971	among them, and consumed <i>them that were</i> in the uttermost parts of the camp.
c14972	And the people cried unto Moses;
c14973	and when Moses prayed unto the LORD,
c14974	the fire was quenched.
c14975	And he called the name of the place Taberah:
c14976	because the fire of the LORD burnt among them.
c14977	And the mixt multitude
c14978	that <i>was</i> among
c14979	them fell a lusting:
c14980	again,
c14981	and the children of Israel also wept
c14982	and said,
c14983	Who shall give us flesh to eat?
c14984	We remember the fish,
c14985	which we did eat in Egypt freely;
c14986	the cucumbers, and the melons, and the leeks, and the onions, and the garlick:
c14987	But now our soul <i>is</i> dried away:
c14988	<i>there is</i> nothing at all,
c14989	beside this manna, <i>before</i> our eyes.
c14990	And the manna
c14991	<i>was</i> as coriander seed,
c14992	and the colour thereof as the colour of bdellium.
c14993	<i>And</i> the people went about,
c14994	and gathered
c14995	<i>it,</i> and ground <i>it</i> in mills,
c14996	or beat <i>it</i> in a mortar,
c14997	and baked <i>it</i> in pans,
c14998	and made cakes
c14999	of it: and the taste of it was as the taste of fresh oil.
c15001	And when the dew fell upon the camp in the night,
c15002	the manna fell upon it.
c15003	Then Moses heard the people
c15004	weep throughout their families,
c15005	every man in the door of his tent:
c15006	and the anger of the LORD was kindled greatly;
c15007	Moses also was displeased.
c15008	And Moses said unto the LORD,
c15009	Wherefore hast thou afflicted thy servant?
c15010	and wherefore have I not found favour in thy sight,
c15011	that thou layest the burden of all this people upon me?
c15012	Have I conceived all this people?
c15013	have I begotten
c15014	them, that thou shouldest say unto
c15015	me, Carry them in thy bosom,
c15016	as a nursing father beareth the sucking child,
c15017	unto the land
c15018	which thou swarest unto their fathers?
c15019	Whence should I have flesh
c15020	to give unto all this people?
c15021	for they weep unto
c15022	me, saying,
c15023	Give us flesh,
c15024	that we may eat.
c15025	I am not able to bear all this people alone,
c15027	because <i>it is</i> too heavy for me.
c15028	And if thou deal thus
c15029	with me, kill me, I pray thee, out of hand,
c15030	if I have found favour in thy sight;
c15031	and let me not see my wretchedness.
c15032	And the LORD said unto Moses,
c15033	Gather unto me seventy men of the elders of Israel,
c15034	whom thou knowest
c15035	to be the elders of the people, and officers
c15036	over them; and bring them unto the tabernacle of the congregation,
c15037	that they may stand there with thee.
c15038	And I will come down
c15039	and talk with thee there:
c15040	and I will take of the spirit
c15041	which <i>is</i> upon
c15042	thee, and will put <i>it</i> upon
c15043	them; and they shall bear the burden of the people with
c15044	thee, that thou bear <i>it</i> not thyself alone.
c15045	And say thou unto the people,
c15046	Sanctify yourselves against to morrow,
c15047	and ye shall eat flesh:
c15048	for ye have wept in the ears of the LORD,
c15049	saying,
c15050	Who shall give us flesh to eat?
c15051	for <i>it was</i> well with us in Egypt:
c15052	therefore the LORD will give you flesh,
c15053	and ye shall eat.
c15054	Ye shall not eat one day,
c15055	nor two days,
c15056	nor five days,
c15057	neither ten days,
c15058	nor twenty days;
c15059	<i>But</i> even a whole month,
c15060	until it come out at your nostrils,
c15061	and it be loathsome
c15062	unto you: because that ye have despised the LORD
c15063	which <i>is</i> among
c15064	you, and have wept before
c15065	him, saying,
c15066	Why came we forth out of Egypt?
c15067	And Moses said,
c15068	The people, among whom I <i>am, are</i> six hundred thousand footmen;
c15070	and thou hast said,
c15071	I will give them flesh,
c15072	that they may eat a whole month.
c15073	Shall the flocks and the herds be slain
c15074	for them, to suffice
c15075	them? or shall all the fish of the sea be gathered together
c15076	for them, to suffice them?
c15077	And the LORD said unto Moses,
c15078	Is the LORD'S hand waxed short?
c15079	thou shalt see now
c15080	whether my word shall come to pass
c15081	unto thee or not.
c15082	And Moses went out,
c15083	and told the people the words of the LORD,
c15084	and gathered the seventy men of the elders of the people,
c15085	and set them round about the tabernacle.
c15086	And the LORD came down in a cloud,
c15087	and spake unto
c15088	him, and took of the spirit
c15089	that <i>was</i> upon
c15090	him, and gave <i>it</i> unto the seventy elders:
c15091	and it came to pass,
c15092	<i>that,</i> when the spirit rested upon
c15093	them, they prophesied,
c15094	and did not cease.
c15095	But there remained two <i>of the</i> men in the camp,
c15096	the name of the one <i>was</i> Eldad,
c15097	and the name of the other Medad:
c15098	and the spirit rested upon
c15099	them; and they <i>were</i> of them that were written,
c15100	but went not out unto the tabernacle:
c15101	and they prophesied in the camp.
c15102	And there ran a young man,
c15103	and told Moses,
c15104	and said,
c15105	Eldad and Medad do prophesy in the camp.
c15106	And Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of Moses, <i>one</i> of his young men, answered
c15107	and said,
c15108	My lord Moses,
c15109	forbid them.
c15110	And Moses said
c15111	unto him, Enviest thou
c15112	for my sake? would God
c15113	that all the LORD'S people were prophets,
c15114	<i>and</i> that the LORD would put his spirit upon them!
c15115	And Moses gat him into the camp, he and the elders of Israel.
c15116	And there went forth a wind from the LORD,
c15117	and brought quails from the sea,
c15118	and let <i>them</i> fall by the camp, as it were a day's journey on this side, and as it were a day's journey on the other side, round about the camp, and as it were two cubits <i>high</i> upon the face of the earth.
c15119	And the people stood up all that day, and all <i>that</i> night, and all the next day,
c15120	and they gathered the quails:
c15121	he that gathered least gathered ten homers:
c15122	and they spread <i>them</i> all abroad for themselves round about the camp.
c15123	And while the flesh
c15124	<i>was</i> yet between their teeth,
c15125	ere it was chewed,
c15126	the wrath of the LORD was kindled against the people,
c15127	and the LORD smote the people with a very great plague.
c15128	And he called the name of that place Kibrothhattaavah:
c15129	because there they buried the people that lusted.
c15130	<i>And</i> the people journeyed from Kibrothhattaavah unto Hazeroth;
c15131	and abode at Hazeroth.
c15132	And Miriam and Aaron spake against Moses because of the Ethiopian woman
c15133	whom he had married:
c15134	for he had married an Ethiopian woman.
c15135	And they said,
c15136	Hath the LORD indeed spoken only by Moses?
c15137	hath he not spoken also
c15138	by us? And the LORD heard <i>it.</i>
c15139	(Now the man Moses <i>was</i> very meek, above all the men
c15140	which <i>were</i> upon the face of the earth.)
c15141	And the LORD spake suddenly unto Moses, and unto Aaron, and unto Miriam,
c15142	Come out ye three unto the tabernacle of the congregation.
c15143	And they three came out.
c15144	And the LORD came down in the pillar of the cloud,
c15145	and stood <i>in</i> the door of the tabernacle,
c15146	and called Aaron and Miriam:
c15147	and they both came forth.
c15148	And he said,
c15149	Hear now my words:
c15150	If there be a prophet
c15151	among you, <i>I</i> the LORD
c15152	will make myself known unto him in a vision,
c15153	<i>and</i> will speak unto him in a dream.
c15154	My servant Moses <i>is</i> not so,
c15155	who <i>is</i> faithful in all mine house.
c15156	With him will I speak mouth to mouth,
c15157	even apparently,
c15158	and not in dark speeches;
c15159	and the similitude of the LORD shall he behold:
c15160	wherefore then were ye not afraid
c15161	to speak against my servant Moses?
c15162	And the anger of the LORD was kindled
c15163	against them; and he departed.
c15164	And the cloud departed from off the tabernacle;
c15165	and, behold,
c15166	Miriam <i>became</i> leprous, <i>white</i> as snow:
c15167	and Aaron looked upon Miriam,
c15168	and, behold, <i>she was</i> leprous.
c15169	And Aaron said unto Moses,
c15170	Alas, my lord,
c15171	I beseech thee, lay not the sin upon
c15172	us, wherein we have done foolishly,
c15173	and wherein we have sinned.
c15174	Let her not be as one dead,
c15175	of whom the flesh is half consumed when he cometh out of his mother's womb.
c15177	And Moses cried unto the LORD,
c15178	saying,
c15180	Heal her now, O God, I beseech thee.
c15181	And the LORD said unto Moses,
c15182	If her father had but spit in her face,
c15183	should she not be ashamed seven days?
c15184	let her be shut out from the camp seven days,
c15185	and after that let her be received in <i>again.</i>
c15186	And Miriam was shut out from the camp seven days:
c15187	and the people journeyed not
c15188	till Miriam was brought in <i>again.</i>
c15189	And afterward the people removed from Hazeroth,
c15190	and pitched in the wilderness of Paran.
c15191	And the LORD spake unto Moses,
c15192	saying,
c15193	Send
c15195	which I give unto the children of Israel: of every tribe of their fathers shall ye send a man,
c15196	thou men, that they may search the land of Canaan,
c15197	every one a ruler among them.
c15198	And Moses by the commandment of the LORD sent them from the wilderness of Paran:
c15199	all those men
c15200	<i>were</i> heads of the children of Israel.
c15201	And these <i>were</i> their names:
c15202	of the tribe of Reuben, Shammua the son of Zaccur.
c15203	Of the tribe of Simeon, Shaphat the son of Hori.
c15204	Of the tribe of Judah, Caleb the son of Jephunneh.
c15205	Of the tribe of Issachar, Igal the son of Joseph.
c15206	Of the tribe of Ephraim, Oshea the son of Nun.
c15207	Of the tribe of Benjamin, Palti the son of Raphu.
c15208	Of the tribe of Zebulun, Gaddiel the son of Sodi.
c15209	Of the tribe of Joseph,
c15210	<i>namely,</i> of the tribe of Manasseh, Gaddi the son of Susi.
c15211	Of the tribe of Dan, Ammiel the son of Gemalli.
c15212	Of the tribe of Asher, Sethur the son of Michael.
c15213	Of the tribe of Naphtali, Nahbi the son of Vophsi.
c15214	Of the tribe of Gad, Geuel the son of Machi.
c15215	These <i>are</i> the names of the men
c15216	which Moses sent
c15217	to spy out the land.
c15218	And Moses called Oshea the son of Nun Jehoshua.
c15219	And Moses sent
c15220	them to spy out the land of Canaan, and said unto
c15222	them, Get you up this <i>way</i> southward,
c15223	and go up into the mountain:
c15224	And see the land,
c15225	what it
c15226	<i>is;</i> and the people
c15227	that dwelleth therein,
c15228	whether they <i>be</i> strong
c15229	or weak,
c15230	few
c15231	or many;
c15232	And what the land
c15233	<i>is</i> that they dwell
c15234	in, whether it <i>be</i> good
c15235	or bad;
c15236	and what cities
c15237	<i>they be</i> that they dwell in,
c15238	whether in tents,
c15239	or in strong holds;
c15240	And what the land
c15241	<i>is,</i> whether it <i>be</i> fat
c15242	or lean,
c15243	whether there be wood
c15244	therein, or not.
c15245	And be ye of good courage,
c15246	and bring of the fruit of the land.
c15247	Now the time <i>was</i> the time of the firstripe grapes.
c15248	So they went up,
c15249	and searched the land from the wilderness of Zin unto Rehob,
c15250	as men come to Hamath.
c15251	And they ascended by the south,
c15252	and came unto Hebron;
c15253	where Ahiman, Sheshai, and Talmai, the children of Anak,
c15254	<i>were.</i> (Now Hebron was built seven years before Zoan in Egypt.)
c15255	And they came unto the brook of Eshcol,
c15256	and cut down from thence a branch with one cluster of grapes,
c15257	and they bare it between two upon a staff;
c15258	and <i>they brought</i> of the pomegranates, and of the figs.
c15259	The place was called the brook Eshcol, because of the cluster of grapes
c15260	which the children of Israel cut down from thence.
c15261	And they returned
c15262	from searching of the land
c15263	after forty days.
c15264	And they went
c15265	and came to Moses, and to Aaron, and to all the congregation of the children of Israel, unto the wilderness of Paran, to Kadesh;
c15266	and brought back word unto them, and unto all the congregation,
c15267	and shewed them the fruit of the land.
c15268	And they told
c15269	him, and said,
c15270	We came unto the land
c15271	whither thou sentest
c15272	us, and surely it floweth with milk and honey;
c15273	and this <i>is</i> the fruit of it.
c15274	Nevertheless the people <i>be</i> strong
c15275	that dwell in the land,
c15276	and the cities <i>are</i> walled, <i>and</i> very great:
c15277	and moreover we saw the children of Anak there.
c15278	The Amalekites dwell in the land of the south:
c15279	and the Hittites, and the Jebusites, and the Amorites, dwell in the mountains:
c15280	and the Canaanites dwell by the sea, and by the coast of Jordan.
c15281	And Caleb stilled the people before Moses,
c15282	and said,
c15283	Let us go up at once,
c15284	and possess
c15285	it; for we are well able to overcome it.
c15286	But the men
c15287	that went up with
c15288	him said,
c15289	We be not able
c15290	to go up against the people;
c15291	for they <i>are</i> stronger than we.
c15292	And they brought up an evil report of the land
c15293	which they had searched
c15294	unto the children of Israel,
c15295	saying,
c15296	The land,
c15297	through which we have gone
c15298	to search
c15299	it, <i>is</i> a land
c15300	eateth up the inhabitants
c15301	that
c15302	thereof; and all the people
c15303	that we saw in
c15304	it <i>are</i> men of a great stature.
c15305	And there we saw the giants, the sons of Anak, <i>which come</i> of the giants:
c15306	and we were in our own sight as grasshoppers,
c15307	and so we were in their sight.
c15308	And all the congregation lifted up
c15309	their voice, and cried;
c15310	and the people wept that night.
c15311	And all the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron:
c15312	and the whole congregation said unto
c15313	them, Would God that we had died in the land of Egypt! or would God we had died in this wilderness!
c15315	And wherefore hath the LORD brought us unto this land,
c15316	to fall by the sword,
c15317	that our wives and our children should be a prey?
c15318	were it not better
c15319	for us to return into Egypt?
c15320	And they said
c15321	one to another,
c15322	Let us make a captain,
c15323	and let us return into Egypt.
c15324	Then Moses and Aaron fell on their faces before all the assembly of the congregation of the children of Israel.
c15325	And Joshua the son of Nun, and Caleb the son of Jephunneh,
c15326	<i>which were</i> of them that searched the land,
c15327	rent their clothes:
c15328	And they spake unto all the company of the children of Israel,
c15329	saying,
c15330	The land,
c15331	which we passed through
c15332	to search
c15333	it, <i>is</i> an exceeding good land.
c15334	If the LORD delight
c15335	in us, then he will bring us into this land,
c15336	and give
c15337	it us; a land
c15338	which floweth with milk and honey.
c15339	Only rebel not ye against the LORD,
c15340	neither fear ye the people of the land;
c15341	for they <i>are</i> bread
c15342	for us: their defence is departed from
c15343	them, and the LORD <i>is</i> with
c15344	us: fear them not.
c15345	But all the congregation bade
c15346	stone them with stones.
c15347	And the glory of the LORD appeared in the tabernacle of the congregation before all the children of Israel.
c15348	And the LORD said unto Moses,
c15349	How long will this people provoke
c15350	me? and how long will it be ere they believe me, for all the signs
c15351	which I have shewed among them?
c15352	I will smite them with the pestilence,
c15353	and disinherit
c15354	them, and will make of thee a greater nation and mightier than they.
c15355	And Moses said unto the LORD,
c15356	Then the Egyptians shall hear
c15357	<i>it,</i> (for thou broughtest up this people in thy might from among them;)
c15358	And they will tell <i>it</i> to the inhabitants of this land:
c15359	<i>for</i> they have heard
c15360	that thou
c15361	LORD
c15362	<i>art</i> among this people,
c15363	that thou LORD art seen face to face,
c15365	and <i>that</i> thy cloud standeth over
c15366	them, and <i>that</i> thou goest before them, by day time in a pillar of a cloud,
c15367	and in a pillar of fire by night.
c15368	Now <i>if</i> thou shalt kill <i>all</i> this people as one man,
c15369	then the nations which have heard the fame of thee will speak,
c15371	saying,
c15372	Because the LORD was not able
c15373	to bring this people into the land
c15374	which he sware
c15375	unto them, therefore he hath slain them in the wilderness.
c15376	And now,
c15377	I beseech thee, let the power of my Lord be great,
c15378	according as thou hast spoken,
c15379	saying,
c15380	The LORD <i>is</i> longsuffering, and of great mercy,
c15381	forgiving iniquity and transgression,
c15382	and by no means clearing
c15383	<i>the guilty,</i> visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth <i>generation.</i>
c15384	Pardon, I beseech thee, the iniquity of this people according unto the greatness of thy mercy,
c15385	and as thou hast forgiven this people, from Egypt even until now.
c15386	And the LORD said,
c15387	I have pardoned according to thy word:
c15388	But <i>as</i> truly <i>as</i> I live,
c15389	all the earth shall be filled with the glory of the LORD.
c15390	Because all those men
c15391	which have seen my glory, and my miracles,
c15392	which I did in Egypt and in the wilderness,
c15393	and have tempted me now these ten times,
c15394	and have not hearkened to my voice;
c15395	Surely they shall not see the land
c15396	which I sware unto their fathers,
c15397	neither shall any of them that provoked me see it:
c15398	But my servant Caleb,
c15399	because he had another spirit with
c15400	him, and hath followed me fully,
c15401	him will I bring into the land
c15402	whereinto he went;
c15403	and his seed shall possess it.
c15404	(Now the Amalekites and the Canaanites dwelt in the valley.)
c15405	To morrow turn
c15406	you, and get you into the wilderness by the way of the Red sea.
c15407	And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron,
c15408	saying,
c15409	How long <i>shall I bear with</i> this evil congregation,
c15410	which murmur against me? I have heard
c15411	the murmurings of the children of Israel,
c15412	which they murmur against me.
c15414	Say unto
c15415	them, <i>As truly as</i> I live,
c15416	saith the LORD,
c15418	as ye have spoken in mine ears,
c15419	so will I do to you:
c15420	Your carcases shall fall in this wilderness; and all that were numbered of you, according to your whole number, from twenty years old and upward,
c15421	which have murmured against me,
c15422	Doubtless ye shall not come into the land,
c15423	<i>concerning</i> which I sware
c15424	to make you dwell
c15425	therein, save Caleb the son of Jephunneh, and Joshua the son of Nun.
c15426	But your little ones,
c15427	which ye said
c15428	should be a prey,
c15429	them will I bring in,
c15430	and they shall know the land
c15431	which ye have despised.
c15432	But <i>as for</i> you, your carcases, they shall fall in this wilderness.
c15433	And your children shall wander in the wilderness forty years,
c15434	and bear your whoredoms,
c15435	until your carcases be wasted in the wilderness.
c15436	After the number of the days
c15437	in which ye searched the land,
c15438	<i>even</i> forty days, each day for a year, shall ye bear your iniquities, <i>even</i> forty years,
c15439	and ye shall know my breach of promise.
c15440	I the LORD have said,
c15441	I will surely do it unto all this evil congregation,
c15442	that are gathered together against
c15443	me: in this wilderness they shall be consumed,
c15444	and there they shall die.
c15445	And the men,
c15446	which Moses sent
c15447	to search the land,
c15448	who returned,
c15449	and made all the congregation to murmur against
c15450	him, by bringing up a slander upon the land,
c15451	Even those men that did bring up the evil report upon the land, died
c15453	by the plague before the LORD.
c15454	But Joshua the son of Nun, and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, <i>which were</i> of the men that went
c15456	to search the land, lived <i>still.</i>
c15457	And Moses told these sayings unto all the children of Israel:
c15458	and the people mourned greatly.
c15459	And they rose up early in the morning,
c15460	and gat them up into the top of the mountain,
c15461	saying,
c15462	Lo,
c15463	we <i>be here,</i> and will go up unto the place
c15464	which the LORD hath promised:
c15465	for we have sinned.
c15466	And Moses said,
c15467	Wherefore now do ye transgress the commandment of the LORD?
c15468	but it shall not prosper.
c15469	Go not up,
c15470	for the LORD <i>is</i> not among
c15471	you; that ye be not smitten before your enemies.
c15472	For the Amalekites and the Canaanites <i>are</i> there before
c15473	you, and ye shall fall by the sword:
c15474	because ye are turned away from the LORD,
c15475	therefore the LORD will not be with you.
c15476	But they presumed
c15477	to go up unto the hill top:
c15478	nevertheless the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and Moses, departed not out of the camp.
c15479	Then the Amalekites came down, and the Canaanites
c15480	which dwelt in that hill,
c15481	and smote
c15482	them, and discomfited them, <i>even</i> unto Hormah.
c15483	And the LORD spake unto Moses,
c15484	saying,
c15485	Speak unto the children of Israel,
c15486	and say unto
c15487	them, When ye be come into the land of your habitations,
c15488	which I give unto you,
c15489	And will make an offering by fire unto the LORD, a burnt offering, or a sacrifice
c15490	in performing a vow,
c15491	or in a freewill offering, or in your solemn feasts,
c15492	to make a sweet savour unto the LORD,
c15493	of the herd, or of the flock:
c15494	Then shall he that offereth
c15495	his offering unto the LORD bring
c15496	a meat offering of a tenth deal of flour
c15497	mingled with the fourth <i>part</i> of an hin of oil.
c15498	And the fourth <i>part</i> of an hin of wine for a drink offering shalt thou prepare with the burnt offering or sacrifice, for one lamb.
c15499	Or for a ram, thou shalt prepare <i>for</i> a meat offering two tenth deals of flour
c15500	mingled with the third <i>part</i> of an hin of oil.
c15501	And for a drink offering thou shalt offer the third <i>part</i> of an hin of wine,
c15502	<i>for</i> a sweet savour unto the LORD.
c15503	And when thou preparest a bullock <i>for</i> a burnt offering, or <i>for</i> a sacrifice
c15504	in performing a vow,
c15505	or peace offerings unto the LORD:
c15506	Then shall he bring with a bullock a meat offering of three tenth deals of flour
c15507	mingled with half an hin of oil.
c15508	And thou shalt bring for a drink offering half an hin of wine,
c15509	<i>for</i> an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD.
c15510	Thus shall it be done for one bullock, or for one ram, or for a lamb, or a kid.
c15511	According to the number
c15512	that ye shall prepare,
c15513	so shall ye do to every one according to their number.
c15514	All that are born of the country shall do these things after this manner,
c15515	in offering an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD.
c15516	And if a stranger sojourn with
c15517	you, or whosoever <i>be</i> among you in your generations,
c15518	and will offer an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD;
c15519	as ye do,
c15520	so he shall do.
c15522	One ordinance <i>shall be both</i> for you of the congregation, and also for the stranger that sojourneth
c15523	<i>with you,</i> an ordinance for ever in your generations:
c15524	as ye <i>are,</i> so shall the stranger be before the LORD.
c15525	One law and one manner shall be for you, and for the stranger
c15526	that sojourneth with you.
c15527	And the LORD spake unto Moses,
c15528	saying,
c15529	Speak unto the children of Israel,
c15530	and say unto
c15531	them, When ye come into the land
c15532	whither I bring you,
c15533	Then it shall be,
c15534	that, when ye eat of the bread of the land,
c15535	ye shall offer up an heave offering unto the LORD.
c15536	Ye shall offer up a cake of the first of your dough <i>for</i> an heave offering:
c15537	as <i>ye do</i> the heave offering of the threshingfloor, so shall ye heave it.
c15538	Of the first of your dough ye shall give unto the LORD an heave offering in your generations.
c15539	And if ye have erred,
c15540	and not observed all these commandments,
c15541	which the LORD hath spoken unto Moses,
c15542	<i>Even</i> all
c15543	that the LORD hath commanded you by the hand of Moses, from the day
c15544	that the LORD commanded
c15545	<i>Moses,</i> and henceforward among your generations;
c15546	Then it shall be,
c15547	if <i>ought</i> be committed by ignorance without the knowledge of the congregation,
c15548	that all the congregation shall offer one young bullock for a burnt offering, for a sweet savour unto the LORD,
c15549	with his meat offering, and his drink offering, according to the manner,
c15550	and one kid of the goats for a sin offering.
c15551	And the priest shall make an atonement for all the congregation of the children of Israel,
c15552	and it shall be forgiven
c15553	them; for it <i>is</i> ignorance:
c15554	and they shall bring their offering, a sacrifice made by fire unto the LORD,
c15555	and their sin offering before the LORD, for their ignorance:
c15556	And it shall be forgiven all the congregation of the children of Israel, and the stranger
c15557	that sojourneth among
c15558	them; seeing all the people <i>were</i> in ignorance.
c15559	And if any soul sin through ignorance,
c15560	then he shall bring a she goat of the first year for a sin offering.
c15561	And the priest shall make an atonement for the soul
c15562	that sinneth ignorantly, when he sinneth by ignorance before the LORD,
c15563	to make an atonement for
c15564	him; and it shall be forgiven him.
c15565	<i>both for</i> him that is born among the children of Israel, and for the stranger
c15566	that sojourneth among them.
c15567	Ye shall have one law
c15568	for him that sinneth through ignorance,
c15569	But the soul
c15570	that doeth <i>ought</i> presumptuously,
c15571	<i>whether he be</i> born in the land, or a stranger, the same reproacheth the LORD;
c15573	and that soul shall be cut off from among his people.
c15574	Because he hath despised the word of the LORD,
c15575	and hath broken his commandment,
c15576	that soul shall utterly be cut off;
c15577	his iniquity <i>shall be</i> upon him.
c15578	And while the children of Israel were in the wilderness,
c15579	they found a man
c15580	that gathered sticks upon the sabbath day.
c15581	brought
c15582	And they that found
c15583	him gathering sticks
c15584	him unto Moses and Aaron, and unto all the congregation.
c15585	And they put him in ward,
c15586	because it was not declared
c15587	what should be done to him.
c15588	And the LORD said unto Moses,
c15589	The man shall be surely put to death:
c15590	all the congregation shall stone him with stones without the camp.
c15591	And all the congregation brought him without the camp,
c15592	and stoned him with stones,
c15593	and he died;
c15594	as the LORD commanded Moses.
c15595	And the LORD spake unto Moses,
c15596	saying,
c15597	Speak unto the children of Israel,
c15598	and bid
c15599	them that they make them fringes in the borders of their garments throughout their generations,
c15600	and that they put upon the fringe of the borders a ribband of blue:
c15601	And it shall be unto you for a fringe,
c15602	that ye may look upon
c15603	it, and remember all the commandments of the LORD,
c15604	and do
c15605	them; and that ye seek not after your own heart and your own eyes, after
c15606	which ye use to go a whoring:
c15607	That ye may remember,
c15608	and do all my commandments,
c15609	and be holy unto your God.
c15610	I <i>am</i> the LORD your God,
c15611	which brought you out of the land of Egypt,
c15612	to be your God:
c15613	I <i>am</i> the LORD your God.
c15614	Now Korah, the son of Izhar, the son of Kohath, the son of Levi, and Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, and On, the son of Peleth, sons of Reuben, took <i>men:</i>
c15615	And they rose up before Moses,
c15616	with certain of the children of Israel, two hundred and fifty princes of the assembly, famous in the congregation, men of renown:
c15617	And they gathered themselves together against Moses and against Aaron,
c15618	and said unto
c15619	them, <i>Ye take</i> too much
c15620	upon you, seeing all the congregation
c15621	<i>are</i> holy, every one
c15622	of them, and the LORD <i>is</i> among
c15623	them: wherefore then lift ye up yourselves above the congregation of the LORD?
c15624	And when Moses heard
c15625	<i>it,</i> he fell upon his face:
c15626	And he spake unto Korah and unto all his company,
c15627	saying,
c15628	Even to morrow
c15629	the LORD will shew
c15630	who
c15631	<i>are</i> his, and <i>who is</i> holy;
c15632	and will cause <i>him</i> to come near unto
c15634	him: even <i>him</i> whom he hath chosen
c15635	will he cause to come near unto him.
c15636	This do;
c15637	Take you censers,
c15638	Korah, and all his company;
c15639	And put fire
c15640	therein, and put incense in them before the LORD to morrow:
c15641	and it shall be
c15642	<i>that</i> the man
c15643	whom the LORD doth choose,
c15644	he <i>shall be</i> holy:
c15645	<i>ye take</i> too much
c15646	upon you, ye sons of Levi.
c15647	And Moses said unto Korah,
c15648	Hear, I pray you,
c15649	ye sons of Levi:
c15650	<i>Seemeth it but</i> a small thing unto
c15651	you, that the God of Israel hath separated you from the congregation of Israel,
c15652	to bring you near to
c15653	himself to do the service of the tabernacle of the LORD,
c15654	and to stand before the congregation
c15655	to minister unto them?
c15656	And he hath brought thee near <i>to him,</i> and all thy brethren the sons of Levi with
c15657	thee: and seek ye the priesthood also?
c15658	For which cause <i>both</i> thou and all thy company
c15659	<i>are</i> gathered together against the LORD:
c15660	<i>is</i> Aaron,
c15661	and what
c15662	that ye murmur against him?
c15663	And Moses sent
c15664	to call Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab:
c15665	which said,
c15666	We will not come up:
c15667	<i>Is it</i> a small thing
c15668	that thou hast brought us up out of a land that floweth with milk and honey,
c15669	to kill us in the wilderness,
c15670	except thou make thyself altogether a prince over us?
c15671	Moreover thou hast not brought us into a land that floweth with milk and honey,
c15672	or given us inheritance of fields and vineyards:
c15673	wilt thou put out the eyes of these men?
c15674	we will not come up.
c15675	And Moses was very wroth,
c15676	and said unto the LORD,
c15677	Respect not thou their offering:
c15678	I have not taken one ass from
c15679	them, neither have I hurt one of them.
c15680	And Moses said unto Korah,
c15681	Be thou and all thy company before the LORD, thou, and they, and Aaron, to morrow:
c15682	And take every man his censer,
c15683	and put incense in
c15684	them, and bring ye before the LORD every man his censer, two hundred and fifty censers;
c15685	thou also, and Aaron, each <i>of you</i> his censer.
c15686	And they took every man his censer,
c15687	and put fire in
c15688	them, and laid incense thereon,
c15689	and stood in the door of the tabernacle of the congregation
c15690	with Moses and Aaron.
c15691	And Korah gathered all the congregation against them unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation:
c15692	and the glory of the LORD appeared unto all the congregation.
c15693	And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron,
c15694	saying,
c15695	Separate yourselves from among this congregation,
c15696	that I may consume them in a moment.
c15697	And they fell upon their faces,
c15698	and said,
c15699	O God, the God of the spirits of all flesh,
c15700	shall one man sin,
c15701	and wilt thou be wroth with all the congregation?
c15702	And the LORD spake unto Moses,
c15703	saying,
c15704	Speak unto the congregation,
c15705	saying,
c15706	Get you up from about the tabernacle of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram.
c15707	And Moses rose up
c15708	and went unto Dathan and Abiram;
c15709	and the elders of Israel followed him.
c15710	And he spake unto the congregation,
c15711	saying,
c15712	Depart, I pray you, from the tents of these wicked men,
c15713	and touch nothing
c15715	of theirs, lest ye be consumed in all their sins.
c15716	So they gat up from the tabernacle of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram, on every side:
c15717	and Dathan and Abiram came out,
c15718	and stood in the door of their tents,
c15719	and their wives, and their sons, and their little children.
c15720	And Moses said,
c15721	Hereby ye shall know
c15722	that the LORD hath sent
c15723	me to do all these works;
c15724	for <i>I have</i> not <i>done them</i> of mine own mind.
c15725	If these men die the common death of all men,
c15726	or if they be visited after the visitation of all men;
c15727	<i>then</i> the LORD hath not sent me.
c15728	But if the LORD make a new thing,
c15729	and the earth open her mouth,
c15730	and swallow them up, with all
c15731	that
c15732	<i>appertain</i> unto them, and they go down quick into the pit;
c15733	then ye shall understand
c15734	that these men have provoked the LORD.
c15735	And it came to pass,
c15736	as he had made an end
c15737	of speaking all these words,
c15738	that the ground clave asunder
c15739	that <i>was</i> under them:
c15740	And the earth opened her mouth,
c15741	and swallowed them up, and their houses, and all the men
c15742	that <i>appertained</i> unto Korah,
c15743	and all <i>their</i> goods.
c15744	They, and all that <i>appertained</i> to them, went down
c15746	alive into the pit,
c15747	and the earth closed upon
c15748	them: and they perished from among the congregation.
c15749	And all Israel
c15750	that <i>were</i> round about
c15751	them fled at the cry
c15752	of them: for they said,
c15753	Lest the earth swallow us up <i>also.</i>
c15754	And there came out a fire from the LORD, and consumed the
c15755	two hundred and fifty men
c15756	that offered incense.
c15757	And the LORD spake unto Moses,
c15758	saying,
c15759	Speak unto Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest,
c15760	that he take up the censers out of the burning,
c15761	and scatter thou the fire yonder;
c15762	for they are hallowed.
c15763	The censers of these sinners against their own souls,
c15764	let them make them broad plates <i>for</i> a covering of the altar:
c15765	for they offered them before the LORD,
c15766	therefore they are hallowed:
c15767	and they shall be a sign unto the children of Israel.
c15768	And Eleazar the priest took the brasen censers,
c15769	wherewith they that were burnt had offered;
c15770	and they were made broad <i>plates for</i> a covering of the altar:
c15771	<i>To be</i> a memorial unto the children of Israel,
c15772	that no stranger, which <i>is</i> not of the seed of Aaron, come near
c15773	as
c15774	to offer incense before the LORD;
c15775	that he be not as Korah, and as his company:
c15776	the LORD said to him by the hand of Moses.
c15777	But on the morrow all the congregation of the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron,
c15778	saying,
c15779	Ye have killed the people of the LORD.
c15780	And it came to pass,
c15781	when the congregation was gathered against Moses and against Aaron,
c15782	that they looked toward the tabernacle of the congregation:
c15783	and, behold, the cloud covered
c15784	it, and the glory of the LORD appeared.
c15785	And Moses and Aaron came before the tabernacle of the congregation.
c15786	And the LORD spake unto Moses,
c15787	saying,
c15788	Get you up from among this congregation,
c15789	that I may consume them as in a moment.
c15790	And they fell upon their faces.
c15791	And Moses said unto Aaron,
c15792	Take a censer,
c15793	and put fire therein from off the altar,
c15794	and put on incense,
c15795	and go quickly unto the congregation,
c15796	and make an atonement for
c15797	them: for there is wrath gone out from the LORD;
c15798	the plague is begun.
c15799	And Aaron took
c15800	as Moses commanded,
c15801	and ran into the midst of the congregation;
c15802	and, behold, the plague was begun among the people:
c15803	and he put on incense,
c15804	and made an atonement for the people.
c15805	And he stood between the dead and the living;
c15806	and the plague was stayed.
c15807	were
c15808	Now they that died in the plague
c15809	fourteen thousand and seven hundred,
c15810	beside them that died about the matter of Korah.
c15811	And Aaron returned unto Moses unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation:
c15812	and the plague was stayed.
c15813	And the LORD spake unto Moses,
c15814	saying,
c15815	Speak unto the children of Israel,
c15816	and take of every one of them a rod according to the house of <i>their</i> fathers, of all their princes according to the house of their fathers twelve rods: write thou
c15817	his rod.
c15818	every man's name upon
c15819	And thou shalt write Aaron's name upon the rod of Levi:
c15820	for one rod <i>shall be</i> for the head of the house of their fathers.
c15821	And thou shalt lay them up in the tabernacle of the congregation before the testimony,
c15822	where I will meet with you.
c15823	And it shall come to pass,
c15824	<i>that</i> the man's
c15826	rod, whom I shall choose, shall blossom:
c15827	and I will make to cease from me the murmurings of the children of Israel,
c15828	whereby they murmur against you.
c15829	And Moses spake unto the children of Israel,
c15830	and every one of their princes gave him a rod apiece, for each prince one, according to their fathers' houses, <i>even</i> twelve rods:
c15831	and the rod of Aaron <i>was</i> among their rods.
c15832	And Moses laid up the rods before the LORD in the tabernacle of witness.
c15833	And it came to pass, that on the morrow
c15834	Moses went into the tabernacle of witness;
c15835	and, behold, the rod of Aaron for the house of Levi was budded,
c15836	and brought forth buds,
c15837	and bloomed blossoms,
c15838	and yielded almonds.
c15839	And Moses brought out all the rods from before the LORD unto all the children of Israel:
c15840	and they looked,
c15841	and took every man his rod.
c15842	And the LORD said unto Moses,
c15843	Bring Aaron's rod again before the testimony, to be kept for a token against the rebels;
c15844	and thou shalt quite take away their murmurings from
c15845	me, that they die not.
c15846	And Moses did
c15847	<i>so:</i> as the LORD commanded
c15848	him, so did he.
c15849	And the children of Israel spake unto Moses,
c15850	saying,
c15851	Behold, we die,
c15852	we perish,
c15853	we all perish.
c15854	Whosoever
c15855	cometh any thing near
c15856	unto the tabernacle of the LORD
c15857	shall die:
c15858	shall we be consumed
c15859	with dying?
c15860	And the LORD said unto Aaron,
c15861	Thou and thy sons and thy father's house with thee shall bear the iniquity of the sanctuary:
c15862	and thou and thy sons with thee shall bear the iniquity of your priesthood.
c15863	And thy brethren also of the tribe of Levi, the tribe of thy father, bring thou with
c15864	thee, that they may be joined unto
c15865	thee, and minister
c15866	unto thee: but thou and thy sons with thee <i>shall minister</i> before the tabernacle of witness.
c15867	And they shall keep thy charge, and the charge of all the tabernacle:
c15868	only they shall not come nigh the vessels of the sanctuary and the altar,
c15869	that neither they, nor ye also, die.
c15870	And they shall be joined unto
c15871	thee, and keep the charge of the tabernacle of the congregation, for all the service of the tabernacle:
c15872	and a stranger shall not come nigh unto you.
c15873	And ye shall keep the charge of the sanctuary, and the charge of the altar:
c15874	that there be no wrath any more upon the children of Israel.
c15875	And I,
c15876	behold, I have taken your brethren the Levites from among the children of Israel:
c15877	to you <i>they are</i> given <i>as</i> a gift for the LORD,
c15878	to do the service of the tabernacle of the congregation.
c15879	Therefore thou and thy sons with thee shall keep your priest's office for every thing of the altar, and within the vail;
c15880	and ye shall serve:
c15881	I have given your priest's office <i>unto you</i> as a service of gift:
c15882	and the stranger
c15883	that cometh nigh
c15884	shall be put to death.
c15885	And the LORD spake unto Aaron,
c15887	Behold, I also have given thee the charge of mine heave offerings
c15888	of all the hallowed things of the children of Israel;
c15889	unto thee have I given them by reason of the anointing,
c15890	and to thy sons, by an ordinance for ever.
c15891	This shall be thine of the most holy things, <i>reserved</i> from the fire:
c15892	every oblation of theirs, every meat offering of theirs, and every sin offering of theirs, and every trespass offering
c15893	of theirs, which they shall render
c15894	unto me, <i>shall be</i> most holy
c15895	for thee and for thy sons.
c15896	In the most holy <i>place</i> shalt thou eat
c15897	it; every male shall eat
c15898	it: it shall be holy unto thee.
c15899	And this <i>is</i> thine; the heave offering of their gift, with all the wave offerings of the children of Israel:
c15900	I have given
c15901	them unto thee, and to thy sons and to thy daughters with thee, by a statute for ever:
c15902	every one that is clean in thy house shall eat of it.
c15903	All the best of the oil, and all the best of the wine, and of the wheat, the firstfruits
c15904	of them which they shall offer unto the LORD,
c15905	them have I given thee.
c15906	<i>And</i> whatsoever is first ripe
c15907	in the land,
c15908	which they shall bring unto the LORD,
c15909	shall be
c15910	thine; every one that is clean in thine house shall eat <i>of</i> it.
c15911	Every thing devoted in Israel shall be thine.
c15912	Every thing that openeth the matrix in all flesh,
c15913	which they bring unto the LORD, <i>whether it be</i> of men or beasts,
c15914	shall be
c15915	thine: nevertheless the firstborn of man shalt thou surely redeem,
c15916	and the firstling of unclean beasts shalt thou redeem.
c15917	And those that are to be redeemed from a month old shalt thou redeem, according to thine estimation, for the money of five shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary,
c15918	which <i>is</i> twenty gerahs.
c15919	But the firstling of a cow, or the firstling of a sheep, or the firstling of a goat, thou shalt not redeem;
c15920	they <i>are</i> holy:
c15921	thou shalt sprinkle their blood upon the altar,
c15922	and shalt burn their fat <i>for</i> an offering made by fire, for a sweet savour unto the LORD.
c15923	And the flesh of them shall be
c15924	thine, as the wave breast and as the right shoulder are thine.
c15925	All the heave offerings of the holy things,
c15926	which the children of Israel offer unto the LORD,
c15927	have I given thee, and thy sons and thy daughters with thee, by a statute for ever:
c15928	it <i>is</i> a covenant of salt for ever before the LORD unto thee and to thy seed with thee.
c15929	And the LORD spake unto Aaron,
c15930	Thou shalt have no inheritance in their land,
c15931	neither shalt thou have any part among
c15932	them: I <i>am</i> thy part and thine inheritance among the children of Israel.
c15934	And, behold, I have given the children of Levi all the tenth in Israel for an inheritance, for their service
c15935	which they serve, <i>even</i> the service of the tabernacle of the congregation.
c15936	Neither must the children of Israel henceforth come nigh the tabernacle of the congregation,
c15937	lest they bear sin,
c15938	and die.
c15939	But the Levites shall do the service of the tabernacle of the congregation,
c15940	and they shall bear their iniquity:
c15941	<i>it shall be</i> a statute for ever throughout your generations,
c15942	that among the children of Israel they have no inheritance.
c15943	But the tithes of the children of Israel,
c15944	which they offer <i>as</i> an heave offering unto the LORD,
c15945	I have given to the Levites to inherit:
c15946	therefore I have said
c15947	unto them, Among the children of Israel they shall have no inheritance.
c15948	And the LORD spake unto Moses,
c15949	saying,
c15950	Thus speak unto the Levites,
c15951	and say unto
c15952	them, When ye take of the children of Israel the tithes
c15953	which I have given you from them for your inheritance,
c15954	then ye shall offer up an heave offering of it for the LORD, <i>even</i> a tenth <i>part</i> of the tithe.
c15955	And <i>this</i> your heave offering shall be reckoned unto you, as though <i>it were</i> the corn of the threshingfloor, and as the fulness of the winepress.
c15956	Thus ye also shall offer an heave offering unto the LORD of all your tithes,
c15957	which ye receive of the children of Israel;
c15958	and ye shall give thereof the LORD'S heave offering to Aaron the priest.
c15959	Out of all your gifts ye shall offer every heave offering of the LORD,
c15960	of all the best thereof, <i>even</i> the hallowed part thereof out of it.
c15961	Therefore thou shalt say unto
c15962	them, When ye have heaved the best thereof from
c15963	it, then it shall be counted unto the Levites as the increase of the threshingfloor, and as the increase of the winepress.
c15964	And ye shall eat it in every place, ye and your households:
c15965	for it <i>is</i> your reward for your service in the tabernacle of the congregation.
c15966	And ye shall bear no sin by reason of
c15967	it, when ye have heaved from it the best of
c15968	it: neither shall ye pollute the holy things of the children of Israel,
c15969	lest ye die.
c15970	And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron,
c15971	saying,
c15972	This <i>is</i> the ordinance of the law
c15973	which the LORD hath commanded,
c15974	saying,
c15975	Speak unto the children of Israel,
c15976	that they bring thee a red heifer without spot,
c15977	wherein <i>is</i> no blemish,
c15978	<i>and</i> upon which never came yoke:
c15979	And ye shall give her unto Eleazar the priest,
c15980	that he may bring her forth without the camp,
c15981	and <i>one</i> shall slay her before his face:
c15982	And Eleazar the priest shall take of her blood with his finger,
c15983	and sprinkle of her blood directly before the tabernacle of the congregation seven times:
c15984	And <i>one</i> shall burn the heifer in his sight;
c15985	her skin, and her flesh, and her blood, with her dung, shall he burn:
c15986	And the priest shall take cedar wood, and hyssop, and scarlet,
c15987	and cast <i>it</i> into the midst of the burning of the heifer.
c15988	Then the priest shall wash his clothes,
c15989	and he shall bathe his flesh in water,
c15990	and afterward he shall come into the camp,
c15991	and the priest shall be unclean until the even.
c15993	And he that burneth
c15994	her shall wash his clothes in water,
c15995	and bathe his flesh in water,
c15996	and shall be unclean until the even.
c15997	And a man <i>that is</i> clean shall gather up the ashes of the heifer,
c15998	and lay <i>them</i> up without the camp in a clean place,
c15999	and it shall be kept for the congregation of the children of Israel for a water of separation:
c16000	it <i>is</i> a purification for sin.
c16001	shall wash
c16002	And he that gathereth the ashes of the heifer
c16003	his clothes,
c16004	and be unclean until the even:
c16005	and it shall be unto the children of Israel, and unto the stranger
c16006	that sojourneth among
c16007	them, for a statute for ever.
c16008	He that toucheth the dead body of any man
c16009	shall be unclean seven days.
c16010	He shall purify himself with it on the third day,
c16011	and on the seventh day he shall be clean:
c16012	but if he purify not himself the third day,
c16013	then the seventh day he shall not be clean.
c16014	Whosoever
c16015	toucheth the dead body of any man
c16016	that is dead,
c16017	and purifieth not himself,
c16018	defileth the tabernacle of the LORD;
c16019	and that soul shall be cut off from Israel:
c16020	because the water of separation was not sprinkled upon
c16021	him, he shall be unclean;
c16022	his uncleanness <i>is</i> yet upon him.
c16023	This <i>is</i> the law,
c16025	when a man dieth in a tent:
c16026	all
c16027	that come into the tent,
c16028	and all
c16029	that <i>is</i> in the tent,
c16030	shall be unclean seven days.
c16031	And every open vessel,
c16032	which hath no covering bound upon
c16033	it, <i>is</i> unclean.
c16034	And whosoever
c16035	toucheth one that is slain with a sword in the open fields, or a dead body, or a bone of a man, or a grave,
c16036	shall be unclean seven days.
c16037	And for an unclean <i>person</i> they shall take of the ashes of the burnt heifer of purification for sin,
c16038	and running water shall be put thereto in a vessel:
c16040	And a clean person shall take hyssop, and dip <i>it</i> in the water,
c16041	and sprinkle <i>it</i> upon the tent, and upon all the vessels, and upon the persons
c16042	that were there,
c16043	and upon him that touched a bone, or one slain, or one dead, or a grave:
c16044	And the clean <i>person</i> shall sprinkle upon the unclean on the third day, and on the seventh day:
c16045	and on the seventh day he shall purify
c16046	himself, and wash his clothes,
c16047	and bathe himself in water,
c16048	and shall be clean at even.
c16049	But the man
c16050	that shall be unclean,
c16051	and shall not purify himself,
c16052	that soul shall be cut off from among the congregation,
c16053	because he hath defiled the sanctuary of the LORD:
c16054	the water of separation hath not been sprinkled upon
c16055	him; he <i>is</i> unclean.
c16056	And it shall be a perpetual statute
c16057	unto them, that he that sprinkleth the water of separation shall wash his clothes;
c16059	and he that toucheth the water of separation
c16060	shall be unclean until even.
c16061	And whatsoever
c16062	the unclean <i>person</i> toucheth
c16063	shall be unclean;
c16064	and the soul
c16065	that toucheth
c16066	<i>it</i> shall be unclean until even.
c16067	Then came the children of Israel, <i>even</i> the whole congregation, into the desert of Zin in the first month:
c16068	and the people abode in Kadesh;
c16069	and Miriam died there,
c16070	and was buried there.
c16071	And there was no water for the congregation:
c16072	and they gathered themselves together against Moses and against Aaron.
c16073	And the people chode with Moses,
c16074	and spake,
c16075	saying,
c16076	Would God that we had died
c16077	when our brethren died before the LORD!
c16078	And why have ye brought up the congregation of the LORD into this wilderness,
c16079	that we and our cattle should die there?
c16080	And wherefore have ye made us to come up out of Egypt,
c16081	to bring us in unto this evil place?
c16082	it <i>is</i> no place of seed, or of figs, or of vines, or of pomegranates;
c16083	neither <i>is</i> there any water
c16084	to drink.
c16085	And Moses and Aaron went from the presence of the assembly unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation,
c16086	and they fell upon their faces:
c16087	and the glory of the LORD appeared unto them.
c16088	And the LORD spake unto Moses,
c16089	saying,
c16090	Take the rod,
c16091	and gather thou the assembly together, thou, and Aaron thy brother,
c16092	and speak ye unto the rock before their eyes;
c16093	and it shall give forth his water,
c16094	and thou shalt bring forth to them water out of the rock:
c16095	so thou shalt give the congregation and their beasts drink.
c16096	And Moses took the rod from before the LORD,
c16097	as he commanded him.
c16098	And Moses and Aaron gathered the congregation together before the rock,
c16099	and he said
c16100	unto them, Hear now,
c16101	ye rebels;
c16102	must we fetch you water out of this rock?
c16103	And Moses lifted up his hand,
c16104	and with his rod he smote the rock twice:
c16105	and the water came out abundantly,
c16106	and the congregation drank, and their beasts <i>also.</i>
c16107	And the LORD spake unto Moses and Aaron, Because ye believed me not,
c16109	to sanctify me in the eyes of the children of Israel,
c16110	therefore ye shall not bring this congregation into the land
c16111	which I have given them.
c16112	This <i>is</i> the water of Meribah;
c16113	because the children of Israel strove with the LORD,
c16114	and he was sanctified in them.
c16115	And Moses sent messengers from Kadesh unto the king of Edom,
c16116	Thus saith thy brother Israel,
c16117	Thou knowest all the travail
c16118	that hath befallen us:
c16119	How our fathers went down into Egypt,
c16120	and we have dwelt in Egypt a long time;
c16121	and the Egyptians vexed us, and our fathers:
c16122	And when we cried unto the LORD,
c16123	he heard our voice,
c16124	and sent an angel,
c16125	and hath brought us forth out of Egypt:
c16126	and, behold, we <i>are</i> in Kadesh, a city in the uttermost of thy border:
c16127	Let us pass, I pray thee, through thy country:
c16128	we will not pass through the fields, or through the vineyards,
c16129	neither will we drink <i>of</i> the water of the wells:
c16130	we will go by the king's <i>high</i> way,
c16131	we will not turn to the right hand nor to the left,
c16132	until we have passed thy borders.
c16133	And Edom said unto
c16134	him, Thou shalt not pass
c16135	by me, lest I come out against thee with the sword.
c16137	And the children of Israel said unto
c16138	him, We will go by the high way:
c16139	and if I and my cattle drink of thy water,
c16140	then I will pay
c16141	for it: I will only, without <i>doing</i> any thing
c16142	<i>else,</i> go through on my feet.
c16143	And he said,
c16144	Thou shalt not go through.
c16145	And Edom came out
c16146	against
c16147	him with much people, and with a strong hand.
c16148	Thus Edom refused
c16149	to give Israel
c16150	passage through his border:
c16151	wherefore Israel turned away from him.
c16153	And the children of Israel, <i>even</i> the whole congregation, journeyed from Kadesh, and came unto mount Hor.
c16154	And the LORD spake unto Moses and Aaron in mount Hor, by the coast of the land of Edom,
c16155	saying,
c16156	Aaron shall be gathered unto his people:
c16157	for he shall not enter into the land
c16158	which I have given unto the children of Israel,
c16159	because ye rebelled against my word at the water of Meribah.
c16160	Take Aaron and Eleazar his son,
c16161	and bring them up unto mount Hor:
c16162	And strip Aaron of his garments,
c16163	and put them upon Eleazar his son:
c16164	and Aaron shall be gathered
c16165	<i>unto his people,</i> and shall die there.
c16166	And Moses did
c16167	as the LORD commanded:
c16168	and they went up into mount Hor in the sight of all the congregation.
c16169	And Moses stripped Aaron of his garments,
c16170	and put them upon Eleazar his son;
c16171	and Aaron died there in the top of the mount:
c16172	and Moses and Eleazar came down from the mount.
c16173	And when all the congregation saw
c16174	that Aaron was dead,
c16175	they mourned for Aaron thirty days, <i>even</i> all the house of Israel.
c16176	And <i>when</i> king Arad the Canaanite, which dwelt in the south, heard tell
c16178	that Israel came by the way of the spies;
c16179	then he fought against Israel,
c16180	and took <i>some</i> of them prisoners.
c16181	And Israel vowed a vow unto the LORD,
c16182	and said,
c16183	If thou wilt indeed deliver this people into my hand,
c16184	then I will utterly destroy their cities.
c16185	And the LORD hearkened to the voice of Israel,
c16186	and delivered up the Canaanites;
c16187	and they utterly destroyed them and their cities:
c16188	and he called the name of the place Hormah.
c16189	And they journeyed from mount Hor by the way of the Red sea,
c16190	to compass the land of Edom:
c16191	and the soul of the people was much discouraged because of the way.
c16192	And the people spake against God, and against Moses,
c16193	Wherefore have ye brought us up out of Egypt
c16194	to die in the wilderness?
c16195	for <i>there is</i> no bread,
c16196	neither <i>is there any</i> water;
c16197	and our soul loatheth this light bread.
c16198	And the LORD sent fiery serpents among the people,
c16199	and they bit the people;
c16200	and much people of Israel died.
c16201	Therefore the people came to Moses,
c16202	and said,
c16203	We have sinned,
c16204	for we have spoken against the LORD,
c16205	and against thee; pray unto the LORD,
c16206	that he take away the serpents from
c16207	us. And Moses prayed for the people.
c16208	And the LORD said unto Moses,
c16209	Make thee a fiery serpent,
c16210	and set it upon a pole:
c16211	and it shall come to pass, that every one that is bitten,
c16212	when he looketh upon
c16213	it, shall live.
c16214	And Moses made a serpent of brass,
c16215	and put it upon a pole,
c16216	and it came to pass,
c16217	that if a serpent had bitten any man,
c16218	when he beheld the serpent of brass,
c16219	he lived.
c16220	And the children of Israel set forward,
c16221	and pitched in Oboth.
c16222	And they journeyed from Oboth,
c16223	and pitched at Ijeabarim, in the wilderness
c16224	which <i>is</i> before Moab, toward the sunrising.
c16225	From thence they removed,
c16226	and pitched in the valley of Zared.
c16227	From thence they removed,
c16228	and pitched on the other side of Arnon,
c16229	which <i>is</i> in the wilderness
c16230	that cometh out of the coasts of the Amorites:
c16231	for Arnon <i>is</i> the border of Moab, between Moab and the Amorites.
c16232	Wherefore it is said in the book of the wars of the LORD,
c16233	What he did in the Red sea,
c16234	and in the brooks of Arnon,
c16235	And at the stream of the brooks
c16236	that goeth down
c16237	to the dwelling of Ar,
c16238	and lieth upon the border of Moab.
c16239	And from thence <i>they went</i> to Beer:
c16240	that <i>is</i> the well
c16241	whereof the LORD spake unto Moses,
c16242	Gather the people together,
c16243	and I will give them water.
c16244	Then Israel sang this song,
c16245	Spring up,
c16246	O well;
c16247	sing ye unto it:
c16248	the well,
c16249	The princes digged
c16250	the nobles of the people digged it, by <i>the direction of</i> the lawgiver, with their staves.
c16251	And from the wilderness <i>they went</i> to Mattanah:
c16252	And from Mattanah to Nahaliel:
c16253	and from Nahaliel to Bamoth:
c16254	And from Bamoth <i>in</i> the valley,
c16255	that <i>is</i> in the country of Moab,
c16256	to the top of Pisgah,
c16257	which looketh toward Jeshimon.
c16258	And Israel sent messengers unto Sihon king of the Amorites,
c16259	saying,
c16260	Let me pass through thy land:
c16261	we will not turn into the fields, or into the vineyards;
c16262	we will not drink <i>of</i> the waters of the well:
c16263	<i>but</i> we will go along by the king's <i>high</i> way,
c16264	until we be past thy borders.
c16265	And Sihon would not suffer Israel
c16266	to pass through his border:
c16267	but Sihon gathered all his people together,
c16268	and went out
c16269	against Israel
c16270	into the wilderness:
c16271	and he came to Jahaz,
c16272	and fought against Israel.
c16273	And Israel smote him with the edge of the sword,
c16274	and possessed his land from Arnon unto Jabbok, even unto the children of Ammon:
c16275	for the border of the children of Ammon <i>was</i> strong.
c16276	And Israel took all these cities:
c16277	and Israel dwelt in all the cities of the Amorites, in Heshbon, and in all the villages thereof.
c16278	For Heshbon
c16279	<i>was</i> the city of Sihon the king of the Amorites, who
c16280	had fought against the former king of Moab,
c16281	and taken all his land out of his hand, even unto Arnon.
c16282	Wherefore they that speak in proverbs say,
c16283	Come
c16284	into Heshbon, let the city of Sihon be built
c16285	and prepared:
c16286	For there is a fire gone out of Heshbon,
c16287	a flame from the city of Sihon:
c16288	it hath consumed Ar of Moab,
c16289	<i>and</i> the lords of the high places of Arnon.
c16290	Woe
c16291	to thee, Moab!
c16292	thou art undone,
c16293	O people of Chemosh:
c16294	he hath given his sons that escaped,
c16295	and his daughters, into captivity unto Sihon king of the Amorites.
c16296	We have shot
c16297	at them; Heshbon is perished even unto Dibon,
c16298	and we have laid them waste even unto Nophah,
c16299	which <i>reacheth</i> unto Medeba.
c16300	Thus Israel dwelt in the land of the Amorites.
c16301	And Moses sent
c16302	to spy out Jaazer,
c16303	and they took the villages
c16304	thereof, and drove out the Amorites
c16305	that <i>were</i> there.
c16306	And they turned
c16307	and went up by the way of Bashan:
c16308	and Og the king of Bashan went out
c16309	against
c16310	them, he, and all his people, to the battle at Edrei.
c16311	And the LORD said unto Moses,
c16312	Fear him not:
c16313	for I have delivered him into thy hand, and all his people, and his land;
c16314	and thou shalt do
c16315	to him as thou didst unto Sihon king of the Amorites,
c16316	which dwelt at Heshbon.
c16317	So they smote him, and his sons, and all his people,
c16318	until there was none left him alive:
c16319	and they possessed his land.
c16320	And the children of Israel set forward,
c16321	and pitched in the plains of Moab on this side Jordan <i>by</i> Jericho.
c16322	And Balak the son of Zippor saw all
c16323	that Israel had done to the Amorites.
c16324	And Moab was sore afraid of the people,
c16325	because they <i>were</i> many:
c16326	and Moab was distressed because of the children of Israel.
c16327	And Moab said unto the elders of Midian,
c16328	Now shall this company lick up all <i>that are</i> round about
c16329	us, as the ox licketh up the grass of the field.
c16330	And Balak the son of Zippor <i>was</i> king of the Moabites at that time.
c16331	He sent messengers therefore unto Balaam the son of Beor to Pethor,
c16332	which <i>is</i> by the river of the land of the children of his people,
c16333	to call
c16334	him, saying,
c16335	Behold, there is a people come out from Egypt:
c16336	behold, they cover the face of the earth,
c16337	and they abide over against me:
c16339	Come now therefore, I pray thee,
c16340	curse me this people;
c16341	for they <i>are</i> too mighty for
c16342	me: peradventure I shall prevail,
c16343	<i>that</i> we may smite
c16344	them, and <i>that</i> I may drive them out of the land:
c16345	for I wot
c16346	that he whom thou blessest
c16347	<i>is</i> blessed,
c16349	and he whom thou cursest
c16350	is cursed.
c16351	And the elders of Moab and the elders of Midian departed
c16352	with the rewards of divination in their hand;
c16353	and they came unto Balaam,
c16354	and spake unto him the words of Balak.
c16355	And he said unto
c16356	them, Lodge here this night,
c16357	and I will bring you word
c16358	again, as the LORD shall speak unto
c16359	me: and the princes of Moab abode with Balaam.
c16360	And God came unto Balaam,
c16361	and said,
c16362	What men <i>are</i> these with thee?
c16363	And Balaam said unto God,
c16364	Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, hath sent unto me, <i>saying,</i>
c16365	Behold, <i>there is</i> a people
c16366	come out of Egypt,
c16367	which covereth the face of the earth:
c16368	come now,
c16369	curse
c16370	me them; peradventure I shall be able
c16371	to overcome
c16372	them, and drive them out.
c16373	And God said unto Balaam,
c16374	Thou shalt not go with
c16375	them; thou shalt not curse the people:
c16376	for they <i>are</i> blessed.
c16377	And Balaam rose up in the morning,
c16378	and said unto the princes of Balak,
c16379	Get you into your land:
c16380	for the LORD refuseth
c16381	to give me leave
c16382	to go with you.
c16383	And the princes of Moab rose up,
c16384	and they went unto Balak,
c16385	and said,
c16386	Balaam refuseth
c16387	to come with us.
c16388	And Balak sent yet again
c16389	princes, more, and more honourable than they.
c16390	And they came to Balaam,
c16391	and said
c16392	to him, Thus saith Balak the son of Zippor,
c16393	Let nothing, I pray thee, hinder
c16394	thee from coming unto me:
c16395	For I will promote thee unto very great honour,
c16396	whatsoever
c16397	thou sayest unto
c16398	and I will do
c16399	me: come therefore, I pray thee,
c16400	curse me this people.
c16401	And Balaam answered
c16402	and said unto the servants of Balak,
c16403	If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold,
c16404	I cannot
c16405	go beyond the word of the LORD my God,
c16406	to do less or more.
c16407	Now therefore, I pray you, tarry ye also here this night,
c16408	that I may know
c16409	what the LORD will say unto me more.
c16411	And God came unto Balaam at night,
c16412	and said
c16413	unto him, If
c16414	to call
c16415	the men come
c16416	thee, rise up,
c16417	<i>and</i> go with
c16418	them; but yet the word
c16419	which I shall say unto
c16420	thee, that shalt thou do.
c16421	And Balaam rose up in the morning,
c16422	and saddled his ass,
c16423	and went with the princes of Moab.
c16424	And God's anger was kindled
c16425	because he went:
c16426	and the angel of the LORD stood in the way for an adversary
c16427	against him. Now he was riding upon his ass,
c16428	and his two servants <i>were</i> with him.
c16429	And the ass saw the angel of the LORD
c16430	standing in the way,
c16431	and his sword drawn in his hand:
c16432	and the ass turned aside out of the way,
c16433	and went into the field:
c16434	and Balaam smote the ass,
c16435	to turn her into the way.
c16436	But the angel of the LORD stood in a path of the vineyards,
c16437	a wall <i>being</i> on this side,
c16438	and a wall on that side.
c16439	And when the ass saw the angel of the LORD,
c16440	she thrust herself unto the wall,
c16441	and crushed Balaam's foot against the wall:
c16442	her again.
c16443	and he smote
c16444	And the angel of the LORD went further,
c16446	and stood in a narrow place,
c16447	where <i>was</i> no way
c16448	to turn either to the right hand or to the left.
c16449	And when the ass saw the angel of the LORD,
c16450	she fell down under Balaam:
c16451	and Balaam's anger was kindled,
c16452	and he smote the ass with a staff.
c16453	And the LORD opened the mouth of the ass,
c16454	and she said unto Balaam,
c16455	What have I done
c16456	unto thee, that thou hast smitten me these three times?
c16457	And Balaam said unto the ass,
c16458	Because thou hast mocked
c16459	me: I would there were a sword in mine hand,
c16460	for now would I kill thee.
c16461	And the ass said unto Balaam,
c16462	<i>Am</i> not I thine ass,
c16463	upon which thou hast ridden ever since <i>I was</i> thine unto this day?
c16464	was I ever wont
c16465	to do so
c16466	unto thee? And he said,
c16467	Nay.
c16468	Then the LORD opened the eyes of Balaam,
c16469	and he saw the angel of the LORD
c16470	standing in the way,
c16471	and his sword drawn in his hand:
c16472	and he bowed down his head,
c16473	and fell flat on his face.
c16474	And the angel of the LORD said unto
c16475	him, Wherefore hast thou smitten thine ass these three times?
c16476	behold, I went out to withstand
c16477	thee, because <i>thy</i> way is perverse before me:
c16478	And the ass saw
c16479	me, and turned from me these three times:
c16480	unless she had turned from
c16481	me, surely now also I had slain
c16482	thee, and saved her alive.
c16483	And Balaam said unto the angel of the LORD,
c16484	I have sinned;
c16485	for I knew not
c16486	that thou stoodest
c16487	in the way against
c16488	me: now
c16489	therefore, if it displease
c16490	thee, I will get me back again.
c16491	And the angel of the LORD said unto Balaam,
c16492	Go with the men:
c16493	but only the word
c16494	that I shall speak unto
c16495	thee, that thou shalt speak.
c16496	So Balaam went with the princes of Balak.
c16497	And when Balak heard
c16498	that Balaam was come,
c16499	he went out
c16500	to meet
c16501	him unto a city of Moab,
c16502	which <i>is</i> in the border of Arnon,
c16503	which <i>is</i> in the utmost coast.
c16504	And Balak said unto Balaam,
c16505	Did I not earnestly send unto
c16506	thee to call
c16507	thee? wherefore camest thou not unto
c16508	me? am I not able indeed
c16509	to promote thee to honour?
c16510	And Balaam said unto Balak,
c16511	Lo, I am come unto
c16512	thee: have I now
c16513	any power at all
c16514	to say any thing?
c16515	the word
c16516	that God putteth in my mouth,
c16517	that shall I speak.
c16518	And Balaam went with Balak,
c16519	and they came unto Kirjathhuzoth.
c16520	And Balak offered oxen and sheep,
c16521	and sent to Balaam, and to the princes
c16522	that <i>were</i> with him.
c16523	And it came to pass on the morrow,
c16524	that Balak took Balaam,
c16525	and brought him up into the high places of Baal,
c16526	that thence he might see the utmost <i>part</i> of the people.
c16527	And Balaam said unto Balak,
c16528	Build me here seven altars,
c16529	and prepare me here seven oxen and seven rams.
c16530	And Balak did
c16531	as Balaam had spoken;
c16532	and Balak and Balaam offered on <i>every</i> altar a bullock and a ram.
c16533	And Balaam said unto Balak,
c16534	Stand by thy burnt offering,
c16535	and I will go:
c16536	peradventure the LORD will come
c16537	to meet
c16538	me: and whatsoever
c16539	he sheweth
c16540	me I will tell
c16541	thee. And he went to an high place.
c16542	And God met Balaam:
c16543	and he said unto
c16544	him, I have prepared seven altars,
c16545	and I have offered upon <i>every</i> altar a bullock and a ram.
c16546	And the LORD put a word in Balaam's mouth,
c16547	and said,
c16548	Return unto Balak,
c16549	and thus thou shalt speak.
c16550	And he returned unto
c16551	him, and, lo, he stood by his burnt sacrifice, he, and all the princes of Moab.
c16552	And he took up his parable,
c16553	and said,
c16554	Balak the king of Moab hath brought me from Aram, out of the mountains of the east,
c16555	<i>saying,</i> Come,
c16556	curse me Jacob,
c16557	and come,
c16558	defy Israel.
c16559	How shall I curse, whom God hath not cursed?
c16561	or how shall I defy,
c16562	<i>whom</i> the LORD hath not defied?
c16563	For from the top of the rocks I see
c16564	him, and from the hills I behold
c16565	him: lo, the people shall dwell alone,
c16566	and shall not be reckoned among the nations.
c16567	Who can count the dust of Jacob, and the number of the fourth <i>part</i> of Israel?
c16568	Let me die the death of the righteous,
c16569	and let my last end be like his!
c16570	And Balak said unto Balaam,
c16571	What hast thou done
c16572	thee to curse mine enemies,
c16573	unto me? I took
c16574	and, behold, thou hast blessed <i>them</i> altogether.
c16575	And he answered
c16576	and said,
c16577	Must I not
c16578	that which the LORD hath put in my mouth?
c16579	take heed
c16580	to speak
c16581	And Balak said unto
c16582	him, Come, I pray thee, with me unto another place,
c16583	from whence thou mayest see
c16584	them: thou shalt see but the utmost part
c16585	of them, and shalt not see them all:
c16586	and curse me them from thence.
c16587	And he brought him into the field of Zophim, to the top of Pisgah,
c16588	and built seven altars,
c16589	and offered a bullock and a ram on <i>every</i> altar.
c16590	And he said unto Balak,
c16591	Stand here by thy burnt offering,
c16592	while I meet <i>the LORD</i> yonder.
c16593	And the LORD met Balaam,
c16594	and put a word in his mouth,
c16595	and said,
c16596	Go again unto Balak,
c16597	and say thus.
c16598	And when he came to
c16599	him, behold, he stood by his burnt offering,
c16600	and the princes of Moab with
c16601	him. And Balak said
c16602	unto him, What hath the LORD spoken?
c16603	And he took up his parable,
c16604	and said,
c16605	Rise up,
c16606	Balak,
c16607	and hear;
c16608	hearken unto
c16609	me, thou son of Zippor:
c16610	God <i>is</i> not a man,
c16611	that he should lie;
c16612	neither the son of man,
c16613	that he should repent:
c16614	hath he said,
c16615	and shall he not do
c16616	<i>it?</i> or hath he spoken,
c16617	and shall he not make it good?
c16618	Behold, I have received <i>commandment</i> to bless:
c16620	and he hath blessed;
c16621	and I cannot reverse it.
c16622	He hath not beheld iniquity in Jacob,
c16623	neither hath he seen perverseness in Israel:
c16624	the LORD his God <i>is</i> with
c16625	him, and the shout of a king <i>is</i> among them.
c16626	God brought them out of Egypt;
c16627	he hath as it were the strength of an unicorn.
c16628	Surely <i>there is</i> no enchantment against Jacob,
c16629	neither <i>is there</i> any divination against Israel:
c16630	according to this time it shall be said of Jacob and of Israel,
c16631	What hath God wrought!
c16632	Behold, the people shall rise up as a great lion,
c16633	and lift up himself as a young lion:
c16634	he shall not lie down
c16635	until he eat <i>of</i> the prey,
c16636	and drink the blood of the slain.
c16637	And Balak said unto Balaam,
c16638	Neither curse them at all,
c16639	nor bless them at all.
c16640	But Balaam answered
c16641	and said unto Balak,
c16642	Told not
c16643	I thee, saying,
c16644	All
c16645	that the LORD speaketh,
c16646	that I must do?
c16647	And Balak said unto Balaam,
c16648	Come, I pray thee,
c16649	I will bring thee unto another place;
c16650	peradventure it will please God
c16651	that thou mayest curse me them from thence.
c16652	And Balak brought Balaam unto the top of Peor,
c16653	that looketh toward Jeshimon.
c16654	And Balaam said unto Balak,
c16655	Build me here seven altars,
c16656	and prepare me here seven bullocks and seven rams.
c16657	And Balak did
c16658	as Balaam had said,
c16659	and offered a bullock and a ram on <i>every</i> altar.
c16660	And when Balaam saw
c16661	that it pleased the LORD
c16662	to bless Israel,
c16663	he went not, as at other times,
c16664	to seek for enchantments,
c16665	but he set his face toward the wilderness.
c16666	And Balaam lifted up his eyes,
c16667	and he saw Israel
c16668	abiding <i>in his tents</i> according to their tribes;
c16669	and the spirit of God came upon him.
c16670	And he took up his parable,
c16671	and said,
c16672	Balaam the son of Beor hath said,
c16673	and the man whose eyes are open hath said:
c16674	He hath said,
c16675	which heard the words of God,
c16676	which saw the vision of the Almighty, falling <i>into a trance,</i> but having his eyes open:
c16677	How goodly are thy tents,
c16678	O Jacob,
c16679	<i>and</i> thy tabernacles,
c16680	O Israel!
c16681	As the valleys are they spread forth, as gardens by the river's
c16682	side, as the trees of lign aloes which the LORD hath planted, <i>and</i> as cedar trees beside the waters.
c16683	He shall pour the water out of his buckets,
c16684	and his seed <i>shall be</i> in many waters,
c16685	and his king shall be higher than Agag,
c16686	and his kingdom shall be exalted.
c16687	God brought him forth out of Egypt;
c16688	he hath as it were the strength of an unicorn:
c16689	he shall eat up the nations his enemies,
c16690	and shall break their bones,
c16691	and pierce <i>them</i> through with his arrows.
c16692	He couched,
c16693	he lay down as a lion, and as a great lion:
c16694	who shall stir him up?
c16695	Blessed
c16696	<i>is</i> he that blesseth
c16698	thee, and cursed
c16699	<i>is</i> he that curseth thee.
c16700	And Balak's anger was kindled against Balaam,
c16701	and he smote his hands together:
c16702	and Balak said unto Balaam,
c16703	thee to curse mine enemies,
c16704	I called
c16705	and, behold, thou hast altogether blessed <i>them</i> these three times.
c16706	Therefore now flee thou to thy place:
c16707	I thought
c16708	to promote thee unto great honour;
c16709	but, lo, the LORD hath kept thee back from honour.
c16710	And Balaam said unto Balak,
c16711	I not also to thy messengers
c16712	which thou sentest unto
c16713	Spake
c16714	me, saying,
c16715	If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold,
c16716	I cannot
c16717	go beyond the commandment of the LORD,
c16718	to do <i>either</i> good or bad of mine own mind;
c16719	<i>but</i> what the LORD saith,
c16720	that will I speak?
c16721	And now,
c16722	behold, I go unto my people:
c16723	come
c16724	<i>therefore, and</i> I will advertise
c16725	thee what this people shall do to thy people in the latter days.
c16726	And he took up his parable,
c16727	and said,
c16728	Balaam the son of Beor hath said,
c16729	and the man whose eyes are open hath said:
c16730	He hath said,
c16731	which heard the words of God,
c16732	and knew the knowledge of the most High,
c16733	<i>which</i> saw the vision of the Almighty, falling <i>into a trance,</i> but having his eyes open:
c16734	I shall see
c16735	him, but not now:
c16736	I shall behold
c16737	him, but not nigh:
c16738	there shall come a Star out of Jacob,
c16739	and a Sceptre shall rise out of Israel,
c16740	and shall smite the corners of Moab, and destroy all the children of Sheth.
c16741	And Edom shall be a possession,
c16742	Seir also shall be a possession for his enemies;
c16743	and Israel shall do valiantly.
c16744	Out of Jacob shall come he that shall have dominion,
c16745	and shall destroy him that remaineth of the city.
c16746	And when he looked on Amalek,
c16747	he took up his parable,
c16748	and said,
c16749	Amalek <i>was</i> the first of the nations;
c16750	but his latter end <i>shall be</i> that he perish for ever.
c16751	And he looked on the Kenites,
c16752	and took up his parable,
c16753	and said,
c16754	Strong is thy dwellingplace,
c16755	and thou puttest thy nest in a rock.
c16756	Nevertheless the Kenite shall be
c16757	wasted,
c16759	until Asshur shall carry thee away captive.
c16760	And he took up his parable,
c16761	and said,
c16762	Alas,
c16763	who shall live
c16764	when God doeth this!
c16765	And ships <i>shall come</i> from the coast of Chittim,
c16766	and shall afflict Asshur,
c16767	and shall afflict Eber,
c16768	and he also shall perish for ever.
c16769	And Balaam rose up,
c16770	and went
c16771	and returned to his place:
c16772	and Balak also went his way.
c16773	And Israel abode in Shittim,
c16774	and the people began
c16775	to commit whoredom with the daughters of Moab.
c16776	And they called the people unto the sacrifices of their gods:
c16777	and the people did eat,
c16778	and bowed down to their gods.
c16779	And Israel joined himself unto Baalpeor:
c16780	and the anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel.
c16781	And the LORD said unto Moses,
c16782	Take all the heads of the people,
c16783	and hang them up before the LORD against the sun,
c16784	that the fierce anger of the LORD may be turned away from Israel.
c16785	And Moses said unto the judges of Israel,
c16786	Slay ye every one his men
c16787	that were joined unto Baalpeor.
c16788	And, behold, one of the children of Israel came
c16789	and brought unto his brethren a Midianitish woman in the sight of Moses, and in the sight of all the congregation of the children of Israel,
c16790	who <i>were</i> weeping <i>before</i> the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.
c16791	And when Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, saw
c16792	<i>it,</i> he rose up from among the congregation,
c16793	and took a javelin in his hand;
c16794	And he went after the man of Israel into the tent,
c16795	and thrust both of them through, the man of Israel, and the woman through her belly.
c16796	So the plague was stayed from the children of Israel.
c16797	were
c16798	And those that died in the plague
c16799	twenty and four thousand.
c16800	And the LORD spake unto Moses,
c16801	saying,
c16802	Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, hath turned my wrath away from the children of Israel,
c16803	in my jealousy.
c16804	while he was zealous for my sake among them, that I consumed not the children of Israel
c16805	Wherefore say,
c16806	Behold, I give unto him my covenant of peace:
c16807	And he shall have it, and his seed after him, <i>even</i> the covenant of an everlasting priesthood;
c16808	because he was zealous for his God,
c16809	and made an atonement for the children of Israel.
c16810	Now the name of the Israelite
c16811	that was slain,
c16812	<i>even</i> that was slain with the Midianitish woman,
c16813	<i>was</i> Zimri, the son of Salu, a prince of a chief house among the Simeonites.
c16814	And the name of the Midianitish woman
c16815	that was slain
c16816	<i>was</i> Cozbi, the daughter of Zur;
c16817	he <i>was</i> head over a people, <i>and</i> of a chief house in Midian.
c16818	And the LORD spake unto Moses,
c16819	saying,
c16820	Vex the Midianites,
c16821	and smite them:
c16822	For they vex you with their wiles,
c16823	wherewith they have beguiled
c16824	you in the matter of Peor, and in the matter of Cozbi, the daughter of a prince of Midian, their sister,
c16825	which was slain in the day of the plague for Peor's sake.
c16826	And it came to pass after the plague,
c16827	that the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest,
c16828	saying,
c16829	Take the sum of all the congregation of the children of Israel, from twenty years old and upward, throughout their fathers' house, all
c16830	that are able to go to war in Israel.
c16831	And Moses and Eleazar the priest spake with them in the plains of Moab by Jordan <i>near</i> Jericho,
c16832	saying,
c16833	<i>Take the sum of the people,</i> from twenty years old and upward;
c16834	as the LORD commanded Moses and the children of Israel,
c16835	which went forth out of the land of Egypt.

c16849	and swallowed them up together with Korah, when that company died,

c16938	These <i>are</i> the families of the sons of Asher according to those that were numbered of them; <i>who were</i> fifty and three thousand and four hundred.
c16939	<i>Of</i> the sons of Naphtali after their families:
c16940	of Jahzeel, the family of the Jahzeelites:
c16941	of Guni, the family of the Gunites:
c16942	Of Jezer, the family of the Jezerites:
c16943	of Shillem, the family of the Shillemites.
c16944	These <i>are</i> the families of Naphtali according to their families:
c16945	and they that were numbered of them <i>were</i> forty and five thousand and four hundred.
c16946	These <i>were</i> the numbered of the children of Israel, six hundred thousand and a thousand seven hundred and thirty.
c16947	And the LORD spake unto Moses,
c16948	saying,
c16949	Unto these the land shall be divided for an inheritance according to the number of names.
c16950	To many thou shalt give the more inheritance,
c16951	and to few thou shalt give the less inheritance:
c16952	to every one shall his inheritance be given according to those that were numbered of him.
c16953	Notwithstanding the land shall be divided by lot:
c16954	according to the names of the tribes of their fathers they shall inherit.
c16955	According to the lot shall the possession thereof be divided between many and few.
c16956	And these <i>are</i> they that were numbered of the Levites after their families:
c16957	of Gershon, the family of the Gershonites:
c16958	of Kohath, the family of the Kohathites:
c16959	of Merari, the family of the Merarites.
c16960	These <i>are</i> the families of the Levites: the family of the Libnites, the family of the Hebronites, the family of the Mahlites, the family of the Mushites, the family of the Korathites.
c16961	And Kohath begat Amram.
c16962	And the name of Amram's wife <i>was</i> Jochebed, the daughter of Levi,
c16963	whom <i>her mother</i> bare to Levi in Egypt:
c16964	and she bare unto Amram Aaron and Moses, and Miriam their sister.
c16965	And unto Aaron was born Nadab, and Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar.
c16966	And Nadab and Abihu died,
c16967	when they offered strange fire before the LORD.
c16968	And those that were numbered of them were twenty and three thousand, all males from a month old and upward:
c16969	for they were not numbered among the children of Israel,
c16970	because there was no inheritance given them among the children of Israel.
c16971	These <i>are</i> they that were numbered by Moses and Eleazar the priest,
c16972	who numbered the children of Israel in the plains of Moab by Jordan <i>near</i> Jericho.
c16973	But among these there was not a man of them whom Moses and Aaron the priest numbered,
c16974	when they numbered the children of Israel in the wilderness of Sinai.
c16975	For the LORD had said
c16976	of them, They shall surely die in the wilderness.
c16977	And there was not left a man of
c16978	them, save Caleb the son of Jephunneh, and Joshua the son of Nun.
c16979	Then came the daughters of Zelophehad, the son of Hepher, the son of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, of the families of Manasseh the son of Joseph:
c16980	and these <i>are</i> the names of his daughters;
c16981	Mahlah, Noah, and Hoglah, and Milcah, and Tirzah.
c16982	And they stood before Moses, and before Eleazar the priest, and before the princes and all the congregation, <i>by</i> the door of the tabernacle of the congregation,
c16983	saying,
c16984	Our father died in the wilderness,
c16985	and he was not in the company
c16986	of them that gathered themselves together against the LORD in the company of Korah;
c16987	but died in his own sin,
c16988	and had no sons.
c16989	Why should the name of our father be done away from among his family,
c16990	because he hath no son?
c16991	Give unto us <i>therefore</i> a possession among the brethren of our father.
c16992	And Moses brought their cause before the LORD.
c16993	And the LORD spake unto Moses,
c16994	saying,
c16995	The daughters of Zelophehad speak right:
c16996	thou shalt surely give them a possession of an inheritance among their father's brethren;
c16997	and thou shalt cause the inheritance of their father to pass unto them.
c16998	And thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel,
c16999	saying,
c17001	If a man die,
c17002	and have no son,
c17003	then ye shall cause his inheritance to pass unto his daughter.
c17004	And if he have no daughter,
c17005	then ye shall give his inheritance unto his brethren.
c17006	And if he have no brethren,
c17007	then ye shall give his inheritance unto his father's brethren.
c17008	And if his father have no brethren,
c17009	then ye shall give his inheritance unto his kinsman
c17010	that is next to him of his family,
c17011	and he shall possess
c17012	it: and it shall be unto the children of Israel a statute of judgment,
c17013	as the LORD commanded Moses.
c17014	And the LORD said unto Moses,
c17015	Get thee up into this mount Abarim,
c17016	and see the land
c17017	which I have given unto the children of Israel.
c17018	And when thou hast seen
c17019	it, thou also shalt be gathered unto thy people,
c17020	as Aaron thy brother was gathered.
c17021	For ye rebelled against my commandment in the desert of Zin, in the strife of the congregation,
c17022	to sanctify me at the water before their eyes:
c17023	that <i>is</i> the water of Meribah in Kadesh in the wilderness of Zin.
c17024	And Moses spake unto the LORD,
c17025	saying,
c17026	Let the LORD, the God of the spirits of all flesh, set a man over the congregation,
c17027	Which may go out before
c17028	them, and which may go in before
c17029	them, and which may lead them out,
c17030	and which may bring them in;
c17031	that the congregation of the LORD be not as sheep
c17032	which have no shepherd.
c17033	And the LORD said unto Moses,
c17034	Take thee Joshua the son of Nun, a man
c17035	in whom <i>is</i> the spirit,
c17036	and lay thine hand upon him;
c17037	And set him before Eleazar the priest, and before all the congregation;
c17038	and give him a charge in their sight.
c17039	And thou shalt put <i>some</i> of thine honour upon
c17040	him, that all the congregation of the children of Israel may be obedient.
c17041	And he shall stand before Eleazar the priest,
c17042	who shall ask <i>counsel</i> for him after the judgment of Urim before the LORD:
c17043	at his word shall they go out,
c17044	and at his word they shall come in, <i>both</i> he, and all the children of Israel with him, even all the congregation.
c17045	And Moses did
c17046	as the LORD commanded
c17047	him: and he took Joshua,
c17048	and set him before Eleazar the priest, and before all the congregation:
c17049	And he laid his hands upon
c17050	him, and gave him a charge,
c17051	as the LORD commanded by the hand of Moses.
c17052	And the LORD spake unto Moses,
c17053	saying,
c17054	Command the children of Israel,
c17055	and say unto
c17056	them, My offering, <i>and</i> my bread for my sacrifices made by fire, <i>for</i> a sweet savour unto me, shall ye observe
c17057	to offer unto me in their due season.
c17058	And thou shalt say
c17059	unto them, This <i>is</i> the offering made by fire
c17060	which ye shall offer unto the LORD;
c17061	two lambs of the first year without spot day by day, <i>for</i> a continual burnt offering.
c17062	The one lamb shalt thou offer in the morning,
c17063	and the other lamb shalt thou offer at even;
c17064	And a tenth <i>part</i> of an ephah of flour for a meat offering,
c17065	mingled with the fourth <i>part</i> of an hin of beaten oil.
c17066	<i>It is</i> a continual burnt offering,
c17067	which was ordained in mount Sinai for a sweet savour, a sacrifice made by fire unto the LORD.
c17068	And the drink offering thereof <i>shall be</i> the fourth <i>part</i> of an hin for the one lamb:
c17069	in the holy <i>place</i> shalt thou cause the strong wine to be poured unto the LORD <i>for</i> a drink offering.
c17070	And the other lamb shalt thou offer at even:
c17071	as the meat offering of the morning, and as the drink offering thereof, thou shalt offer
c17072	<i>it,</i> a sacrifice made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD.
c17073	And on the sabbath day two lambs of the first year without spot, and two tenth deals of flour <i>for</i> a meat offering,
c17074	mingled with oil,
c17075	and the drink offering thereof:
c17076	<i>This is</i> the burnt offering of every sabbath, beside the continual burnt offering, and his drink offering.
c17077	And in the beginnings of your months ye shall offer a burnt offering unto the LORD; two young bullocks, and one ram, seven lambs of the first year without spot;
c17078	And three tenth deals of flour <i>for</i> a meat offering,
c17079	mingled with oil,
c17080	for one bullock;
c17081	and two tenth deals of flour <i>for</i> a meat offering,
c17082	mingled with oil,
c17083	for one ram;
c17084	And a several tenth deal of flour mingled with oil <i>for</i> a meat offering
c17086	unto one lamb;
c17087	<i>for</i> a burnt offering of a sweet savour,
c17088	a sacrifice made by fire unto the LORD.
c17089	And their drink offerings
c17090	shall be half an hin of wine unto a bullock,
c17091	and the third <i>part</i> of an hin unto a ram,
c17092	and a fourth <i>part</i> of an hin unto a lamb:
c17093	this <i>is</i> the burnt offering of every month throughout the months of the year.
c17094	And one kid of the goats for a sin offering unto the LORD shall be offered, beside the continual burnt offering,
c17095	and his drink offering.
c17096	And in the fourteenth day of the first month <i>is</i> the passover of the LORD.
c17097	And in the fifteenth day of this month <i>is</i> the feast:
c17098	seven days shall unleavened bread be eaten.
c17099	In the first day <i>shall be</i> an holy convocation;
c17100	ye shall do no manner of servile work <i>therein:</i>
c17101	But ye shall offer a sacrifice made by fire <i>for</i> a burnt offering unto the LORD; two young bullocks, and one ram, and seven lambs of the first year:

c17109	to make an atonement for you.
c17110	beside the burnt offering in the morning,
c17111	which <i>is</i> for a continual burnt offering.
c17112	Ye shall offer these
c17113	After this manner ye shall offer daily, throughout the seven days, the meat of the sacrifice made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD:
c17114	it shall be offered beside the continual burnt offering,
c17115	and his drink offering.
c17116	And on the seventh day ye shall have an holy convocation;
c17117	ye shall do no servile work.
c17118	Also in the day of the firstfruits,
c17119	when ye bring a new meat offering unto the LORD, after your weeks
c17120	<i>be out,</i> ye shall have an holy convocation;

c17133	and their drink offerings.
c17134	And in the seventh month, on the first <i>day</i> of the month, ye shall have an holy convocation;

c17192	And Moses told the children of Israel according to all
c17193	that the LORD commanded Moses.
c17194	And Moses spake unto the heads of the tribes concerning the children of Israel,
c17195	saying,
c17196	This <i>is</i> the thing
c17197	which the LORD hath commanded.
c17199	If a man vow a vow unto the LORD,
c17200	or swear an oath
c17201	to bind his soul with a bond;
c17202	he shall not break his word,
c17203	according to all
c17204	that proceedeth out of his mouth.
c17205	he shall do
c17207	If a woman also vow a vow unto the LORD,
c17208	and bind herself by a bond, <i>being</i> in her father's house in her youth;
c17209	And her father hear her vow, and her bond
c17210	wherewith she hath bound her soul,
c17211	and her father shall hold his peace
c17212	at her: then all her vows shall stand,
c17213	and every bond
c17214	wherewith she hath bound her soul
c17215	shall stand.
c17216	But if her father disallow her in the day
c17217	that he heareth;
c17219	wherewith she hath bound her soul, shall stand:
c17220	not any of her vows, or of her bonds
c17221	and the LORD shall forgive
c17222	her, because her father disallowed her.
c17223	And if she had at all an husband,
c17224	when she vowed,
c17225	or uttered ought out of her lips,
c17226	wherewith she bound her soul;
c17227	And her husband heard <i>it,</i> and held his peace at her in the day
c17228	that he heard
c17230	<i>it:</i> then her vows shall stand,
c17231	and her bonds
c17232	wherewith she bound her soul
c17233	shall stand.
c17234	But if her husband
c17235	that he heard
c17236	disallowed her on the day
c17237	<i>it;</i> then he shall make her vow which she vowed,
c17239	and that which she uttered with her lips,
c17240	wherewith she bound her soul, of none effect:
c17241	and the LORD shall forgive her.
c17242	vow of a widow, and of her that is divorced,
c17243	But every
c17244	wherewith they have bound their souls,
c17245	shall stand against her.
c17246	And if she vowed in her husband's house,
c17247	or bound her soul by a bond with an oath;
c17248	And her husband heard
c17249	<i>it,</i> and held his peace
c17250	at her, <i>and</i> disallowed her not:
c17251	then all her vows shall stand,
c17252	and every bond
c17253	wherewith she bound her soul
c17254	shall stand.
c17255	But if her husband hath utterly made them void on the day
c17256	he heard
c17257	<i>them; then</i> whatsoever proceeded out of her lips concerning her vows, or concerning the bond of her soul, shall not stand:
c17258	her husband hath made them void;
c17259	and the LORD shall forgive her.
c17260	Every vow, and every binding oath
c17261	to afflict the soul,
c17262	her husband may establish
c17263	it, or her husband may make it void.
c17264	But if her husband altogether hold his peace at her from day to day;
c17265	then he establisheth all her vows, or all her bonds,
c17266	which <i>are</i> upon
c17267	her: he confirmeth
c17268	them, because he held his peace at her in the day
c17269	that he heard <i>them.</i>
c17270	But if he shall any ways make them void
c17271	after that he hath heard
c17272	<i>them;</i> then he shall bear her iniquity.
c17273	These <i>are</i> the statutes,
c17274	which the LORD commanded Moses,
c17275	between a man and his wife, between the father and his daughter, <i>being yet</i> in her youth in her father's house.
c17276	And the LORD spake unto Moses,
c17277	saying,
c17278	Avenge the children of Israel of the Midianites:
c17279	afterward shalt thou be gathered unto thy people.
c17280	And Moses spake unto the people,
c17281	saying,
c17282	Arm some of yourselves unto the war,
c17283	and let them go against the Midianites,
c17284	and avenge the LORD of Midian.
c17285	Of every tribe a thousand, throughout all the tribes of Israel, shall ye send to the war.
c17286	So there were delivered out of the thousands of Israel, a thousand of <i>every</i> tribe, twelve thousand armed for war.
c17287	And Moses sent them to the war, a thousand of <i>every</i> tribe,
c17288	them and Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, to the war,
c17289	with the holy instruments, and the trumpets to blow in his hand.
c17290	And they warred against the Midianites,
c17291	as the LORD commanded Moses;
c17292	and they slew all the males.
c17293	And they slew the kings of Midian, beside the rest of them that were slain; <i>namely,</i> Evi, and Rekem, and Zur, and Hur, and Reba, five kings of Midian:
c17294	Balaam also the son of Beor they slew with the sword.
c17295	And the children of Israel took <i>all</i> the women of Midian captives, and their little ones,
c17296	and took the spoil of all their cattle, and all their flocks, and all their goods.
c17297	And they burnt all their cities wherein they dwelt, and all their goodly castles, with fire.
c17298	And they took all the spoil, and all the prey, <i>both</i> of men and of beasts.
c17299	And they brought the captives, and the prey, and the spoil, unto Moses, and Eleazar the priest, and unto the congregation of the children of Israel, unto the camp at the plains of Moab,
c17300	which <i>are</i> by Jordan <i>near</i> Jericho.
c17301	And Moses, and Eleazar the priest, and all the princes of the congregation, went forth
c17302	to meet
c17303	them without the camp.
c17304	And Moses was wroth with the officers of the host, <i>with</i> the captains over thousands, and captains over hundreds,
c17305	which came from the battle.
c17306	And Moses said unto
c17307	them, Have ye saved all the women alive?
c17308	Behold, these caused the children of Israel, through the counsel of Balaam,
c17309	to commit trespass against the LORD in the matter of Peor,
c17310	and there was a plague among the congregation of the LORD.
c17311	Now therefore kill every male among the little ones,
c17312	every woman
c17313	that hath known man by lying with him.
c17314	and kill
c17315	But all the women children,
c17316	that have not known a man by lying
c17317	with him, keep alive for yourselves.
c17318	And do ye abide without the camp seven days:
c17319	whosoever
c17320	hath killed any person,
c17321	and whosoever
c17322	hath touched any slain,
c17323	purify <i>both</i> yourselves and your captives on the third day, and on the seventh day.
c17324	And purify all <i>your</i> raiment, and all that is made of skins, and all work of goats' <i>hair,</i> and all things made of wood.
c17325	And Eleazar the priest said unto the men of war
c17326	which went to the battle,
c17327	This <i>is</i> the ordinance of the law
c17328	which the LORD commanded Moses;
c17329	Only the gold, and the silver, the brass, the iron, the tin, and the lead,
c17330	Every thing
c17331	that may abide the fire,
c17332	ye shall make <i>it</i> go through the fire,
c17333	and it shall be clean:
c17334	nevertheless it shall be purified with the water of separation:
c17335	and all
c17336	that abideth not the fire
c17337	ye shall make go through the water.
c17338	And ye shall wash your clothes on the seventh day,
c17339	and ye shall be clean,
c17340	and afterward ye shall come into the camp.
c17341	And the LORD spake unto Moses,
c17342	saying,
c17343	Take the sum of the prey that was taken, <i>both</i> of man and of beast, thou, and Eleazar the priest, and the chief fathers of the congregation:
c17344	And divide the prey into two parts; between them that took the war
c17345	upon them, who went out to battle,
c17346	and between all the congregation:
c17347	And levy a tribute unto the LORD of the men of war
c17348	which went out to battle:
c17349	one soul of five hundred, <i>both</i> of the persons, and of the beeves, and of the asses, and of the sheep:
c17350	Take <i>it</i> of their half,
c17351	and give it unto Eleazar the priest, <i>for</i> an heave offering of the LORD.
c17352	And of the children of Israel's half, thou shalt take one portion of fifty, of the persons, of the beeves, of the asses, and of the flocks, of all manner of beasts,
c17353	and give them unto the Levites, which keep the charge of the tabernacle of the LORD.
c17354	And Moses and Eleazar the priest did
c17355	as the LORD commanded Moses.
c17356	And the booty, <i>being</i> the rest of the prey which the men of war had caught, was
c17358	six hundred thousand and seventy thousand and five thousand sheep,
c17359	And threescore and twelve thousand beeves,
c17360	And threescore and one thousand asses,
c17361	of women
c17362	that had not known man by lying with him.
c17363	And thirty and two thousand persons in all,
c17364	And the half, <i>which was</i> the portion of them that went out to war, was
c17366	in number three hundred thousand and seven and thirty thousand and five hundred sheep:
c17367	And the LORD'S tribute of the sheep was six hundred and threescore and fifteen.
c17368	And the beeves <i>were</i> thirty and six thousand;
c17369	of which the LORD'S tribute <i>was</i> threescore and twelve.
c17370	And the asses <i>were</i> thirty thousand and five hundred;
c17371	of which the LORD'S tribute <i>was</i> threescore and one.
c17372	And the persons <i>were</i> sixteen thousand;
c17373	of which the LORD'S tribute <i>was</i> thirty and two persons.
c17374	And Moses gave the tribute, <i>which was</i> the LORD'S heave offering, unto Eleazar the priest,
c17375	as the LORD commanded Moses.
c17376	And of the children of Israel's half,
c17377	which Moses divided from the men
c17378	that warred,
c17379	(Now the half <i>that pertained unto</i> the congregation was three hundred thousand and thirty thousand <i>and</i> seven thousand and five hundred sheep,
c17380	And thirty and six thousand beeves,
c17381	And thirty thousand asses and five hundred,
c17382	And sixteen thousand persons;)
c17383	Even of the children of Israel's half, Moses took one portion of fifty, <i>both</i> of man and of beast,
c17384	and gave them unto the Levites, which kept the charge of the tabernacle of the LORD;
c17385	as the LORD commanded Moses.
c17386	And the officers which <i>were</i> over thousands of the host,
c17388	the captains of thousands, and captains of hundreds, came near unto Moses:
c17389	And they said unto Moses,
c17390	Thy servants have taken the sum of the men of war
c17391	which <i>are</i> under our charge,
c17392	and there lacketh not one man of us.
c17393	We have therefore brought an oblation for the LORD,
c17395	what every man hath gotten,
c17396	of jewels of gold, chains, and bracelets, rings, earrings, and tablets,
c17397	to make an atonement for our souls before the LORD.
c17398	And Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold of them, <i>even</i> all wrought jewels.
c17399	And all the gold of the offering that they offered up to the LORD,
c17401	of the captains of thousands, and of the captains of hundreds, was sixteen thousand seven hundred and fifty shekels.
c17402	<i>(For</i> the men of war had taken spoil,
c17403	every man for himself.)
c17404	And Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold of the captains of thousands and of hundreds,
c17405	and brought it into the tabernacle of the congregation, <i>for</i> a memorial for the children of Israel before the LORD.
c17406	Now the children of Reuben and the children of Gad had a very great multitude of cattle:
c17408	and when they saw the land of Jazer, and the land of Gilead,
c17409	that, behold, the place <i>was</i> a place for cattle;
c17410	The children of Gad and the children of Reuben came
c17411	and spake unto Moses, and to Eleazar the priest, and unto the princes of the congregation,
c17412	saying,
c17413	Ataroth, and Dibon, and Jazer, and Nimrah, and Heshbon, and Elealeh, and Shebam, and Nebo, and Beon,
c17414	<i>Even</i> the country
c17415	which the LORD smote before the congregation of Israel,
c17416	<i>is</i> a land for cattle,
c17417	and thy servants have cattle:
c17418	Wherefore, said
c17419	they, if we have found grace in thy sight,
c17420	let this land be given unto thy servants for a possession,
c17421	<i>and</i> bring us not over Jordan.
c17422	And Moses said unto the children of Gad and to the children of Reuben,
c17423	Shall your brethren go to war,
c17424	and shall ye sit here?
c17425	And wherefore discourage ye the heart of the children of Israel
c17426	from going over into the land
c17427	which the LORD hath given them?
c17428	Thus did your fathers,
c17429	when I sent them from Kadeshbarnea
c17430	to see the land.
c17431	For when they went up unto the valley of Eshcol,
c17432	and saw the land,
c17433	they discouraged the heart of the children of Israel,
c17434	that they should not go into the land
c17435	which the LORD had given them.
c17436	And the LORD'S anger was kindled the same time,
c17437	and he sware,
c17438	saying,
c17439	Surely none of the men that came up out of Egypt,
c17441	from twenty years old and upward, shall see the land
c17442	which I sware unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob;
c17443	because they have not wholly followed me:
c17444	Save Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenezite, and Joshua the son of Nun:
c17445	for they have wholly followed the LORD.
c17446	And the LORD'S anger was kindled against Israel,
c17447	and he made them wander in the wilderness forty years,
c17448	until all the generation, that had done
c17450	evil in the sight of the LORD, was consumed.
c17451	And, behold, ye are risen up in your fathers' stead, an increase of sinful men,
c17452	to augment yet the fierce anger of the LORD toward Israel.
c17453	For if ye turn away from after
c17454	him, he will yet again
c17455	leave them in the wilderness;
c17456	and ye shall destroy all this people.
c17457	And they came near unto
c17458	him, and said,
c17459	We will build sheepfolds here for our cattle,
c17460	and cities for our little ones:
c17461	But we ourselves will go ready armed
c17462	before the children of Israel,
c17463	until we have brought them unto their place:
c17464	and our little ones shall dwell in the fenced cities because of the inhabitants of the land.
c17465	We will not return unto our houses,
c17466	until the children of Israel have inherited every man his inheritance.
c17467	For we will not inherit with them on yonder side Jordan, or forward;
c17468	because our inheritance is fallen to us on this side Jordan eastward.
c17469	And Moses said unto
c17470	them, If ye will do this thing,
c17471	if ye will go armed before the LORD to war,
c17472	And will go all of you armed over Jordan before the LORD,
c17473	until he hath driven out his enemies from before him,
c17474	And the land be subdued before the LORD:
c17475	then afterward ye shall return,
c17476	and be guiltless before the LORD, and before Israel;
c17477	and this land shall be your possession before the LORD.
c17478	But if ye will not do so,
c17479	behold, ye have sinned against the LORD:
c17480	and be sure your sin
c17481	will find you out.
c17482	Build you cities for your little ones,
c17483	and folds for your sheep;
c17485	that which hath proceeded out of your mouth.
c17486	and do
c17487	And the children of Gad and the children of Reuben spake unto Moses,
c17488	saying,
c17489	Thy servants will do
c17490	as my lord commandeth.
c17491	Our little ones, our wives, our flocks, and all our cattle, shall be there in the cities of Gilead:
c17492	But thy servants will pass over, every man armed for war, before the LORD to battle,
c17493	as my lord saith.
c17494	So concerning them Moses commanded Eleazar the priest, and Joshua the son of Nun, and the chief fathers of the tribes of the children of Israel:
c17495	And Moses said unto
c17496	them, If the children of Gad and the children of Reuben will pass with you over Jordan, every man armed to battle, before the LORD,
c17497	and the land shall be subdued before
c17498	you; then ye shall give them the land of Gilead for a possession:
c17499	But if they will not pass over with you armed,
c17500	they shall have possessions among you in the land of Canaan.
c17501	And the children of Gad and the children of Reuben answered,
c17502	saying,
c17503	As the LORD hath said unto thy servants,
c17504	so will we do.
c17505	We will pass over armed before the LORD into the land of Canaan,
c17506	that the possession of our inheritance on this side Jordan <i>may be</i> ours.
c17507	And Moses gave unto them, <i>even</i> to the children of Gad, and to the children of Reuben, and unto half the tribe of Manasseh the son of Joseph, the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites, and the kingdom of Og king of Bashan, the land, with the cities thereof in the coasts, <i>even</i> the cities of the country round about.
c17508	And the children of Gad built Dibon, and Ataroth, and Aroer,
c17509	And Atroth, Shophan, and Jaazer, and Jogbehah,
c17510	And Bethnimrah, and Bethharan, fenced cities: and folds for sheep.
c17511	And the children of Reuben built Heshbon, and Elealeh, and Kirjathaim,
c17512	And Nebo, and Baalmeon,
c17513	(their names being changed,)
c17514	and Shibmah:
c17515	and gave other names unto the cities
c17516	which they builded.
c17517	And the children of Machir the son of Manasseh went to Gilead,
c17518	and took
c17519	it, and dispossessed the Amorite
c17520	which <i>was</i> in it.
c17521	And Moses gave Gilead unto Machir the son of Manasseh;
c17522	and he dwelt therein.
c17523	And Jair the son of Manasseh went
c17524	and took the small towns
c17525	thereof, and called them Havothjair.
c17526	And Nobah went
c17527	and took Kenath, and the villages
c17528	thereof, and called it Nobah, after his own name.
c17529	These <i>are</i> the journeys of the children of Israel,
c17530	which went forth out of the land of Egypt with their armies under the hand of Moses and Aaron.
c17531	And Moses wrote their goings out according to their journeys by the commandment of the LORD:
c17532	and these <i>are</i> their journeys according to their goings out.
c17533	And they departed from Rameses in the first month, on the fifteenth day of the first month;
c17534	on the morrow after the passover the children of Israel went out with an high hand in the sight of all the Egyptians.
c17535	For the Egyptians buried
c17536	which the LORD had smitten
c17537	all <i>their</i> firstborn,
c17538	among them: upon their gods also the LORD executed judgments.
c17539	And the children of Israel removed from Rameses,
c17540	and pitched in Succoth.
c17541	And they departed from Succoth,
c17542	and pitched in Etham,
c17543	which <i>is</i> in the edge of the wilderness.
c17544	And they removed from Etham,
c17545	and turned again unto Pihahiroth,
c17546	which <i>is</i> before Baalzephon:
c17547	and they pitched before Migdol.
c17548	And they departed from before Pihahiroth,
c17549	and passed through the midst of the sea into the wilderness,
c17550	and went three days' journey in the wilderness of Etham,
c17551	and pitched in Marah.
c17552	And they removed from Marah,
c17553	and came unto Elim:
c17554	and in Elim <i>were</i> twelve fountains of water, and threescore and ten palm trees;
c17555	and they pitched there.
c17556	And they removed from Elim,
c17557	and encamped by the Red sea.
c17558	And they removed from the Red sea,
c17559	and encamped in the wilderness of Sin.
c17560	And they took their journey out of the wilderness of Sin,
c17561	and encamped in Dophkah.
c17562	And they departed from Dophkah,
c17563	and encamped in Alush.
c17564	And they removed from Alush,
c17565	and encamped at Rephidim,
c17566	where was no water for the people
c17567	to drink.
c17568	And they departed from Rephidim,
c17569	and pitched in the wilderness of Sinai.
c17570	And they removed from the desert of Sinai,
c17571	and pitched at Kibrothhattaavah.
c17572	And they departed from Kibrothhattaavah,
c17573	and encamped at Hazeroth.
c17574	And they departed from Hazeroth,
c17575	and pitched in Rithmah.
c17576	And they departed from Rithmah,
c17577	and pitched at Rimmonparez.
c17578	And they departed from Rimmonparez,
c17579	and pitched in Libnah.
c17580	And they removed from Libnah,
c17581	and pitched at Rissah.
c17582	And they journeyed from Rissah,
c17583	and pitched in Kehelathah.
c17584	And they went from Kehelathah,
c17585	and pitched in mount Shapher.
c17586	And they removed from mount Shapher,
c17587	and encamped in Haradah.
c17588	And they removed from Haradah,
c17589	and pitched in Makheloth.
c17590	And they removed from Makheloth,
c17591	and encamped at Tahath.
c17592	And they departed from Tahath,
c17593	and pitched at Tarah.
c17594	And they removed from Tarah,
c17595	and pitched in Mithcah.
c17596	And they went from Mithcah,
c17597	and pitched in Hashmonah.
c17598	And they departed from Hashmonah,
c17599	and encamped at Moseroth.
c17600	And they departed from Moseroth,
c17601	and pitched in Benejaakan.
c17602	And they removed from Benejaakan,
c17603	and encamped at Horhagidgad.
c17604	And they went from Horhagidgad,
c17605	and pitched in Jotbathah.
c17606	And they removed from Jotbathah,
c17607	and encamped at Ebronah.
c17608	And they departed from Ebronah,
c17609	and encamped at Eziongaber.
c17610	And they removed from Eziongaber,
c17611	and pitched in the wilderness of Zin,
c17612	which <i>is</i> Kadesh.
c17613	And they removed from Kadesh,
c17614	and pitched in mount Hor, in the edge of the land of Edom.
c17615	And Aaron the priest went up into mount Hor at the commandment of the LORD,
c17616	and died there, in the fortieth year
c17617	after the children of Israel were come out of the land of Egypt,
c17618	in the first <i>day</i> of the fifth month.
c17619	And Aaron <i>was</i> an hundred and twenty and three years old when he died in mount Hor.
c17620	And king Arad the Canaanite, which dwelt in the south in the land of Canaan, heard
c17622	of the coming of the children of Israel.
c17623	And they departed from mount Hor,
c17624	and pitched in Zalmonah.
c17625	And they departed from Zalmonah,
c17626	and pitched in Punon.
c17627	And they departed from Punon,
c17628	and pitched in Oboth.
c17629	And they departed from Oboth,
c17630	and pitched in Ijeabarim, in the border of Moab.
c17631	And they departed from Iim,
c17632	and pitched in Dibongad.
c17633	And they removed from Dibongad,
c17634	and encamped in Almondiblathaim.
c17635	And they removed from Almondiblathaim,
c17636	and pitched in the mountains of Abarim, before Nebo.
c17637	And they departed from the mountains of Abarim,
c17638	and pitched in the plains of Moab by Jordan <i>near</i> Jericho.
c17639	And they pitched by Jordan, from Bethjesimoth <i>even</i> unto Abelshittim in the plains of Moab.
c17640	And the LORD spake unto Moses in the plains of Moab by Jordan <i>near</i> Jericho,
c17641	saying,
c17642	Speak unto the children of Israel,
c17643	and say unto
c17644	them, When ye are passed over Jordan into the land of Canaan;
c17645	Then ye shall drive out all the inhabitants of the land from before
c17646	you, and destroy all their pictures,
c17647	and destroy all their molten images,
c17648	and quite pluck down all their high places:
c17649	And ye shall dispossess <i>the inhabitants</i> of the land,
c17650	and dwell
c17651	therein: for I have given you the land
c17652	to possess it.
c17653	And ye shall divide the land by lot for an inheritance among your families:
c17654	<i>and</i> to the more ye shall give the more inheritance,
c17655	and to the fewer ye shall give the less inheritance:
c17656	in the place where his lot falleth;
c17657	every man's <i>inheritance</i> shall be
c17658	according to the tribes of your fathers ye shall inherit.
c17659	But if ye will not drive out the inhabitants of the land from before
c17660	you; then it shall come to pass,
c17661	that those which ye let remain of
c17662	them <i>shall be</i> pricks in your eyes,
c17663	and thorns in your sides,
c17664	and shall vex you in the land
c17665	wherein ye dwell.
c17666	Moreover it shall come to pass,
c17667	unto you, as I thought
c17668	<i>that</i> I shall do
c17669	to do unto them.
c17670	And the LORD spake unto Moses,
c17671	saying,
c17672	Command the children of Israel,
c17673	and say unto
c17674	them, When ye come into the land of Canaan;
c17675	(this <i>is</i> the land
c17676	that shall fall unto you for an inheritance,
c17677	<i>even</i> the land of Canaan with the coasts thereof:)
c17678	Then your south quarter shall be from the wilderness of Zin along by the coast of Edom,
c17679	and your south border shall be the outmost coast of the salt sea eastward:
c17680	And your border shall turn from the south to the ascent of Akrabbim,
c17681	and pass on to Zin:
c17682	and the going forth thereof shall be from the south to Kadeshbarnea,
c17683	and shall go on to Hazaraddar,
c17684	and pass on to Azmon:
c17685	And the border shall fetch a compass from Azmon unto the river of Egypt,
c17686	and the goings out of it shall be at the sea.
c17687	And <i>as for</i> the western border,
c17688	ye shall even have the great sea
c17689	for a border:
c17690	this shall be your west border.
c17691	And this shall be your north border:
c17692	from the great sea ye shall point out for you mount Hor:
c17693	From mount Hor ye shall point out
c17694	<i>your border</i> unto the entrance of Hamath;
c17695	and the goings forth of the border shall be to Zedad:
c17696	And the border shall go on to Ziphron,
c17697	and the goings out of it shall be at Hazarenan:
c17698	this shall be your north border.
c17699	And ye shall point out your east border from Hazarenan to Shepham:
c17700	And the coast shall go down from Shepham to Riblah, on the east side of Ain;
c17701	and the border shall descend,
c17702	and shall reach unto the side of the sea of Chinnereth eastward:
c17703	And the border shall go down to Jordan,
c17704	and the goings out of it shall be at the salt sea:
c17705	this shall be your land with the coasts thereof round about.
c17706	And Moses commanded the children of Israel,
c17707	saying,
c17708	This <i>is</i> the land
c17709	which ye shall inherit by lot,
c17710	which the LORD commanded
c17711	to give unto the nine tribes, and to the half tribe:
c17712	For the tribe of the children of Reuben according to the house of their fathers, and the tribe of the children of Gad according to the house of their fathers, have received
c17713	<i>their inheritance;</i> and half the tribe of Manasseh have received their inheritance:
c17714	The two tribes and the half tribe have received their inheritance on this side Jordan <i>near</i> Jericho eastward, toward the sunrising.
c17715	And the LORD spake unto Moses,
c17716	saying,
c17717	These <i>are</i> the names of the men
c17718	which shall divide the land
c17719	unto you: Eleazar the priest, and Joshua the son of Nun.
c17720	And ye shall take one prince of every tribe,
c17721	to divide the land by inheritance.
c17722	And the names of the men <i>are</i> these:
c17723	Of the tribe of Judah, Caleb the son of Jephunneh.
c17724	And of the tribe of the children of Simeon, Shemuel the son of Ammihud.
c17725	Of the tribe of Benjamin, Elidad the son of Chislon.
c17726	And the prince of the tribe of the children of Dan, Bukki the son of Jogli.
c17728	The prince of the children of Joseph, for the tribe of the children of Manasseh, Hanniel the son of Ephod.
c17729	And the prince of the tribe of the children of Ephraim, Kemuel the son of Shiphtan.
c17730	And the prince of the tribe of the children of Zebulun, Elizaphan the son of Parnach.
c17731	And the prince of the tribe of the children of Issachar, Paltiel the son of Azzan.
c17732	And the prince of the tribe of the children of Asher, Ahihud the son of Shelomi.
c17733	And the prince of the tribe of the children of Naphtali, Pedahel the son of Ammihud.
c17734	These
c17735	<i>are they</i> whom the LORD commanded
c17736	to divide the inheritance unto the children of Israel in the land of Canaan.
c17737	And the LORD spake unto Moses in the plains of Moab by Jordan <i>near</i> Jericho,
c17738	saying,
c17739	Command the children of Israel,
c17740	that they give unto the Levites of the inheritance of their possession cities
c17741	to dwell in;
c17742	and ye shall give <i>also</i> unto the Levites suburbs for the cities round about them.
c17743	And the cities shall they have
c17744	to dwell in;
c17745	and the suburbs of them shall be for their cattle, and for their goods, and for all their beasts.
c17746	And the suburbs of the cities,
c17747	which ye shall give unto the Levites,
c17748	<i>shall reach</i> from the wall of the city and outward a thousand cubits round about.
c17749	And ye shall measure from without the city on the east side two thousand cubits,
c17750	and on the south side two thousand cubits,
c17751	and on the west side two thousand cubits,
c17752	and on the north side two thousand cubits;
c17753	and the city <i>shall be</i> in the midst:
c17754	this shall be to them the suburbs of the cities.
c17756	which ye shall give unto the Levites <i>there shall be</i> six cities for refuge,
c17757	And among the cities
c17758	which ye shall appoint
c17759	for the manslayer, that he may flee thither:
c17760	and to them ye shall add forty and two cities.
c17761	<i>So</i> all the cities
c17762	which ye shall give to the Levites
c17763	<i>shall be</i> forty and eight cities:
c17764	them <i>shall ye give</i> with their suburbs.
c17765	And the cities
c17766	which ye shall give <i>shall be</i> of the possession of the children of Israel:
c17767	from <i>them that have</i> many ye shall give many;
c17768	but from <i>them that have</i> few ye shall give few:
c17769	every one shall give of his cities unto the Levites according to his inheritance
c17770	which he inheriteth.
c17772	And the LORD spake unto Moses,
c17773	saying,
c17774	Speak unto the children of Israel,
c17775	and say unto
c17776	them, When ye be come over Jordan into the land of Canaan;
c17777	Then ye shall appoint you cities
c17778	to be cities of refuge
c17779	for you; that the slayer may flee thither,
c17780	which killeth any person at unawares.
c17781	And they shall be unto you cities for refuge from the avenger;
c17782	that the manslayer die not,
c17783	until he stand before the congregation in judgment.
c17784	And of these cities
c17785	which ye shall give
c17786	six cities shall ye have for refuge.
c17787	Ye shall give three cities on this side Jordan,
c17788	and three cities shall ye give in the land of Canaan,
c17789	<i>which</i> shall be cities of refuge.
c17790	These six cities shall be a refuge, <i>both</i> for the children of Israel, and for the stranger, and for the sojourner among
c17791	them: that every one that killeth any person unawares may flee thither.
c17793	And if he smite him with an instrument of iron,
c17794	so that he die,
c17795	he <i>is</i> a murderer:
c17796	the murderer shall surely be put to death.
c17797	And if he smite him with throwing a stone,
c17798	wherewith he may die,
c17800	and he die,
c17801	he <i>is</i> a murderer:
c17802	the murderer shall surely be put to death.
c17803	Or <i>if</i> he smite him with an hand weapon of wood,
c17804	wherewith he may die,
c17806	and he die,
c17807	he <i>is</i> a murderer:
c17808	the murderer shall surely be put to death.
c17809	The revenger of blood
c17810	himself shall slay the murderer:
c17811	when he meeteth
c17812	him, he shall slay him.
c17813	But if he thrust him of hatred,
c17814	or hurl at him by laying of wait,
c17815	that he die;
c17816	Or in enmity smite him with his hand,
c17817	that he die:
c17818	he that smote <i>him</i> shall surely be put to death;
c17819	<i>for</i> he <i>is</i> a murderer:
c17820	the revenger of blood shall slay the murderer,
c17821	when he meeteth him.
c17822	But if he thrust him suddenly without enmity,
c17823	or have cast upon him any thing without laying of wait,
c17824	Or with any stone,
c17825	wherewith a man may die,
c17826	seeing <i>him</i> not,
c17827	and cast <i>it</i> upon
c17828	him, that he die,
c17829	and <i>was</i> not his enemy,
c17830	neither sought his harm:
c17831	Then the congregation shall judge between the slayer and the revenger of blood according to these judgments:
c17832	And the congregation shall deliver the slayer out of the hand of the revenger of blood,
c17833	and the congregation shall restore him to the city of his refuge,
c17834	whither he was fled:
c17835	and he shall abide in it unto the death of the high priest,
c17836	which was anointed with the holy oil.
c17837	But if the slayer shall at any time come without the border of the city of his refuge,
c17838	whither he was fled;
c17839	And the revenger of blood find him without the borders of the city of his refuge,
c17840	and the revenger of blood kill the slayer;
c17841	he shall not be guilty of blood:
c17842	Because he should have remained in the city of his refuge until the death of the high priest:
c17843	but after the death of the high priest the slayer shall return into the land of his possession.
c17844	So these <i>things</i> shall be for a statute of judgment unto you throughout your generations in all your dwellings.
c17845	Whoso killeth any person,
c17846	the murderer shall be put to death by the mouth of witnesses:
c17847	but one witness shall not testify against any person
c17848	<i>to cause him</i> to die.
c17849	Moreover ye shall take no satisfaction for the life of a murderer,
c17850	which <i>is</i> guilty
c17851	of death:
c17852	but he shall be surely put to death.
c17853	And ye shall take no satisfaction
c17854	for him that is fled to the city of his refuge,
c17855	that he should come again
c17856	to dwell in the land, until the death of the priest.
c17857	So ye shall not pollute the land
c17858	wherein ye
c17859	<i>are:</i> for blood
c17860	it defileth the land:
c17861	and the land cannot be cleansed of the blood
c17862	that is shed
c17863	therein, but by the blood of him that shed it.
c17864	Defile not therefore the land
c17865	which ye shall inhabit,
c17866	wherein I dwell:
c17867	for I the LORD dwell among the children of Israel.
c17868	And the chief fathers of the families of the children of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, of the families of the sons of Joseph, came near,
c17869	and spake before Moses, and before the princes, the chief fathers of the children of Israel:
c17870	And they said,
c17871	The LORD commanded my lord
c17872	to give the land for an inheritance by lot to the children of Israel:
c17873	and my lord was commanded by the LORD
c17874	to give the inheritance of Zelophehad our brother unto his daughters.
c17875	And if they be married to any of the sons of the <i>other</i> tribes of the children of Israel,
c17876	then shall their inheritance be taken from the inheritance of our fathers,
c17877	and shall be put to the inheritance of the tribe
c17878	whereunto they are received:
c17879	so shall it be taken from the lot of our inheritance.
c17880	And when the jubile of the children of Israel shall be,
c17881	then shall their inheritance be put unto the inheritance of the tribe
c17882	whereunto they are received:
c17883	so shall their inheritance be taken away from the inheritance of the tribe of our fathers.
c17884	And Moses commanded the children of Israel according to the word of the LORD,
c17885	saying,
c17886	The tribe of the sons of Joseph hath said well.
c17887	This <i>is</i> the thing
c17888	which the LORD doth command concerning the daughters of Zelophehad,
c17889	saying,
c17890	Let them marry to whom they think best;
c17891	only to the family of the tribe of their father shall they marry.
c17892	So shall not the inheritance of the children of Israel remove from tribe to tribe:
c17893	for every one
c17894	of the children of Israel shall keep himself to the inheritance of the tribe of his fathers.
c17895	And every daughter,
c17896	that possesseth an inheritance in any tribe of the children of Israel,
c17897	shall be wife unto one of the family of the tribe of her father,
c17898	that the children of Israel may enjoy every man the inheritance of his fathers.
c17899	Neither shall the inheritance remove from <i>one</i> tribe to another tribe;
c17900	but every one
c17901	of the tribes of the children of Israel shall keep himself to his own inheritance.
c17902	Even as the LORD commanded Moses,
c17903	so did the daughters of Zelophehad:
c17904	For Mahlah, Tirzah, and Hoglah, and Milcah, and Noah, the daughters of Zelophehad, were married unto their father's brothers' sons:
c17905	<i>And</i> they were married into the families of the sons of Manasseh the son of Joseph,
c17906	and their inheritance remained in the tribe of the family of their father.
c17907	These <i>are</i> the commandments and the judgments,
c17908	which the LORD commanded by the hand of Moses unto the children of Israel in the plains of Moab by Jordan <i>near</i> Jericho.
c17909	These <i>be</i> the words
c17910	which Moses spake unto all Israel on this side Jordan in the wilderness, in the plain over against the Red <i>sea,</i> between Paran, and Tophel, and Laban, and Hazeroth, and Dizahab.
c17911	<i>(There are</i> eleven days' <i>journey</i> from Horeb by the way of mount Seir unto Kadeshbarnea.)
c17912	And it came to pass
c17913	in the fortieth year, in the eleventh month, on the first <i>day</i> of the month, <i>that</i> Moses spake unto the children of Israel, according unto all
c17914	that the LORD had given him in commandment unto them;
c17915	After he had slain Sihon the king of the Amorites,
c17916	which dwelt in Heshbon,
c17917	and Og the king of Bashan,
c17918	which dwelt at Astaroth
c17919	in Edrei:
c17920	On this side Jordan, in the land of Moab, began Moses
c17921	to declare this law,
c17922	saying,
c17923	The LORD our God spake unto us in Horeb,
c17924	saying,
c17926	Ye have dwelt long enough in this mount:
c17927	Turn
c17928	you, and take your journey,
c17929	and go to the mount of the Amorites,
c17930	and unto all <i>the places</i> nigh thereunto, in the plain, in the hills, and in the vale, and in the south, and by the sea side,
c17931	to the land of the Canaanites, and unto Lebanon, unto the great river, the river Euphrates.
c17932	Behold,
c17933	I have set the land before
c17934	you: go in
c17935	and possess the land
c17936	which the LORD sware unto your fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob,
c17937	to give unto them and to their seed after them.
c17938	And I spake unto you at that time,
c17939	saying,
c17940	I am not able to bear you myself alone:
c17942	The LORD your God hath multiplied
c17943	you, and, behold, ye <i>are</i> this day as the stars of heaven for multitude.
c17944	(The LORD God of your fathers make you a thousand times so many more
c17945	as ye <i>are,</i> and bless
c17946	you, as he hath promised you!)
c17947	How can I myself alone bear your cumbrance, and your burden, and your strife?
c17948	Take you wise men, and understanding, and known among your tribes,
c17949	and I will make them rulers over you.
c17950	And ye answered
c17951	me, and said,
c17952	The thing which thou hast spoken <i>is</i> good
c17954	<i>for us</i> to do.
c17955	So I took the chief of your tribes, wise men, and known,
c17956	and made them heads over
c17957	you, captains over thousands, and captains over hundreds, and captains over fifties, and captains over tens, and officers among your tribes.
c17958	And I charged your judges at that time,
c17959	saying,
c17960	Hear <i>the causes</i> between your brethren,
c17961	and judge righteously between <i>every</i> man and his brother, and the stranger <i>that is</i> with him.
c17962	Ye shall not respect persons in judgment;
c17963	<i>but</i> ye shall hear the small as well as the great;
c17964	ye shall not be afraid of the face of man;
c17965	for the judgment
c17966	<i>is</i> God's:
c17967	and the cause
c17968	that is too hard for
c17969	you, bring <i>it</i> unto
c17970	me, and I will hear it.
c17971	And I commanded you at that time all the things
c17972	which ye should do.
c17973	And when we departed from Horeb,
c17974	we went through all that great and terrible wilderness,
c17975	which ye saw
c17976	by the way of the mountain of the Amorites,
c17977	as the LORD our God commanded
c17978	us; and we came to Kadeshbarnea.
c17979	And I said unto
c17980	you, Ye are come unto the mountain of the Amorites,
c17981	which the LORD our God doth give unto us.
c17982	Behold,
c17983	the LORD thy God hath set the land before
c17984	thee: go up
c17985	<i>and</i> possess
c17986	<i>it,</i> as the LORD God of thy fathers hath said
c17987	unto thee; fear not,
c17988	neither be discouraged.
c17989	And ye came near unto me every one
c17990	of you, and said,
c17991	We will send men before
c17992	us, and they shall search us out the land,
c17993	and bring us word again by what way
c17994	we must go up,
c17996	and into what cities we shall come.
c17997	And the saying pleased me well:
c17998	and I took twelve men of
c17999	you, one of a tribe:
c18000	And they turned
c18001	and went up into the mountain,
c18002	and came unto the valley of Eshcol,
c18003	and searched it out.
c18004	And they took of the fruit of the land in their hands,
c18005	and brought <i>it</i> down unto
c18006	us, and brought us word
c18007	again, and said,
c18008	<i>It is</i> a good land
c18009	which the LORD our God doth give us.
c18010	Notwithstanding ye would not
c18011	go up,
c18012	but rebelled against the commandment of the LORD your God:
c18013	And ye murmured in your tents,
c18014	and said,
c18015	Because the LORD hated us, he hath brought us forth out of the land of Egypt,
c18016	to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites,
c18017	to destroy us.
c18018	Whither shall we go up?
c18019	our brethren have discouraged our heart,
c18020	saying,
c18021	The people
c18022	<i>is</i> greater and taller than
c18023	we; the cities
c18024	<i>are</i> great and walled up to heaven;
c18025	and moreover we have seen the sons of the Anakims there.
c18026	Then I said unto
c18027	you, Dread not,
c18028	neither be afraid of them.
c18029	The LORD your God
c18030	which goeth before
c18031	you, he shall fight for you, according to all
c18032	that he did for you in Egypt before your eyes;
c18033	And in the wilderness,
c18034	where thou hast seen
c18035	how that the LORD thy God bare
c18036	thee, as a man doth bear his son,
c18037	in all the way
c18038	that ye went,
c18039	until ye came into this place.
c18040	Yet in this thing ye did not believe the LORD your God,
c18041	Who went in the way before
c18042	you, to search you out a place
c18043	to pitch your tents
c18044	<i>in,</i> in fire by night,
c18045	to shew you by what way
c18046	ye should go,
c18047	and in a cloud by day.
c18048	And the LORD heard the voice of your words,
c18049	and was wroth,
c18050	and sware,
c18051	saying,
c18052	Surely there shall not one of these men of this evil generation see that good land,
c18053	which I sware
c18054	to give unto your fathers,
c18055	Save Caleb the son of Jephunneh;
c18056	he shall see
c18057	it, and to him will I give the land
c18058	that he hath trodden
c18059	upon, and to his children,
c18060	because he hath wholly followed the LORD.
c18061	Also the LORD was angry with me for your sakes,
c18062	saying,
c18063	Thou also shalt not go in thither.
c18064	<i>But</i> Joshua the son of Nun,
c18065	which standeth before
c18066	thee, he shall go in thither:
c18067	encourage
c18068	him: for he shall cause Israel to inherit it.
c18069	Moreover your little ones,
c18070	which ye said
c18071	should be a prey,
c18072	and your children,
c18073	which in that day had no knowledge between good and evil,
c18074	they shall go in thither,
c18075	and unto them will I give
c18076	it, and they shall possess it.
c18077	But <i>as for</i> you, turn
c18078	you, and take your journey into the wilderness by the way of the Red sea.
c18079	Then ye answered
c18080	and said unto
c18081	me, We have sinned against the LORD, we
c18082	will go up
c18083	and fight,
c18084	according to all
c18085	that the LORD our God commanded
c18086	us. And when ye had girded on
c18087	every man his weapons of war,
c18088	ye were ready
c18089	to go up into the hill.
c18090	And the LORD said unto
c18091	me, Say
c18092	unto them, Go not up,
c18093	neither fight;
c18094	for I <i>am</i> not among
c18095	you; lest ye be smitten before your enemies.
c18096	So I spake unto
c18097	you; and ye would not hear,
c18098	but rebelled against the commandment of the LORD,
c18100	and went presumptuously up into the hill.
c18101	And the Amorites, which dwelt in that mountain, came out
c18103	against
c18104	you, and chased
c18105	you, as bees do,
c18106	and destroyed you in Seir, <i>even</i> unto Hormah.
c18107	And ye returned
c18108	and wept before the LORD;
c18109	but the LORD would not hearken to your voice,
c18110	nor give ear unto you.
c18111	So ye abode in Kadesh many days, according unto the days
c18112	that ye abode <i>there.</i>
c18113	Then we turned,
c18114	and took our journey into the wilderness by the way of the Red sea,
c18115	as the LORD spake unto
c18116	me: and we compassed mount Seir many days.
c18117	And the LORD spake unto
c18118	me, saying,
c18119	long enough:
c18120	Ye have compassed this mountain
c18121	turn you northward.
c18122	And command thou the people,
c18123	saying,
c18124	Ye <i>are</i> to pass through the coast of your brethren the children of Esau,
c18125	which dwell in Seir;
c18126	and they shall be afraid of
c18127	you: take ye good heed unto yourselves therefore:
c18128	Meddle not
c18129	with them; for I will not give you of their land, no, not so much as a foot breadth;
c18130	because I have given mount Seir unto Esau <i>for</i> a possession.
c18131	Ye shall buy meat of them for money,
c18132	that ye may eat;
c18133	and ye shall also buy water of them for money,
c18134	that ye may drink.
c18135	For the LORD thy God hath blessed thee in all the works of thy hand:
c18136	he knoweth
c18137	thy walking through this great wilderness: these forty years
c18138	the LORD thy God <i>hath been</i> with
c18139	thee; thou hast lacked nothing.
c18140	And when we passed by from our brethren the children of Esau,
c18141	which dwelt in Seir,
c18142	through the way of the plain from Elath, and from Eziongaber,
c18143	we turned
c18144	and passed by the way of the wilderness of Moab.
c18145	And the LORD said unto
c18146	me, Distress not the Moabites,
c18147	neither contend with them in battle:
c18148	for I will not give thee of their land <i>for</i> a possession;
c18149	because I have given Ar unto the children of Lot <i>for</i> a possession.
c18150	The Emims dwelt therein in times past, a people great, and many, and tall, as the Anakims;
c18151	Which also were accounted giants, as the Anakims;
c18152	but the Moabites call them Emims.
c18153	The Horims also dwelt in Seir beforetime;
c18154	but the children of Esau succeeded
c18155	them, when they had destroyed them from before
c18156	them, and dwelt in their stead;
c18157	as Israel did unto the land of his possession,
c18158	which the LORD gave unto them.
c18159	Now rise up,
c18160	<i>said I,</i> and get you over the brook Zered.
c18161	And we went over the brook Zered.
c18162	And the space
c18163	in which we came from Kadeshbarnea,
c18164	until we were come over the brook Zered,
c18165	<i>was</i> thirty and eight years;
c18166	until all the generation of the men of war were wasted out from among the host,
c18167	as the LORD sware unto them.
c18168	For indeed the hand of the LORD was
c18169	against them, to destroy them from among the host,
c18170	until they were consumed.
c18171	So it came to pass,
c18172	when all the men of war were consumed
c18173	and dead
c18174	from among the people,
c18175	That the LORD spake unto
c18176	me, saying,
c18177	Thou art to pass over through Ar, the coast of Moab, this day:
c18178	And <i>when</i> thou comest nigh over against the children of Ammon,
c18179	distress them not,
c18180	nor meddle
c18181	with them: for I will not give thee of the land of the children of Ammon <i>any</i> possession;
c18182	because I have given it unto the children of Lot <i>for</i> a possession.
c18183	(That also was accounted a land of giants:
c18184	giants dwelt therein in old time;
c18185	and the Ammonites call them Zamzummims;
c18186	A people great, and many, and tall, as the Anakims;
c18187	but the LORD destroyed them before
c18188	them; and they succeeded
c18189	them, and dwelt in their stead:
c18190	As he did to the children of Esau,
c18191	which dwelt in Seir,
c18192	when he destroyed the Horims from before
c18193	them; and they succeeded
c18194	them, and dwelt in their stead even unto this day:
c18195	And the Avims
c18196	which dwelt in Hazerim, <i>even</i> unto Azzah,
c18197	the Caphtorims,
c18198	which came forth out of Caphtor,
c18199	destroyed
c18200	them, and dwelt in their stead.)
c18201	Rise ye up,
c18202	take your journey,
c18203	and pass over the river Arnon:
c18204	behold,
c18205	I have given into thine hand Sihon the Amorite, king of Heshbon, and his land:
c18206	begin
c18207	to possess
c18208	<i>it,</i> and contend with him in battle.
c18209	This day will I begin
c18210	to put the dread of thee and the fear of thee upon the nations <i>that are</i> under the whole heaven,
c18211	who shall hear report
c18212	of thee, and shall tremble,
c18213	and be in anguish because of thee.
c18214	And I sent messengers out of the wilderness of Kedemoth unto Sihon king of Heshbon with words of peace,
c18215	saying,
c18216	Let me pass through thy land:
c18217	I will go along by the high way,
c18218	I will neither turn unto the right hand nor to the left.
c18219	Thou shalt sell me meat for money,
c18220	that I may eat;
c18221	and give me water for money,
c18222	that I may drink:
c18223	only I will pass through on my feet;
c18224	(As the children of Esau which dwell in Seir,
c18226	and the Moabites
c18227	which dwell in Ar, did
c18228	unto me;) until I shall pass over Jordan into the land
c18229	which the LORD our God giveth us.
c18230	But Sihon king of Heshbon would not
c18231	let us pass
c18232	by him: for the LORD thy God hardened his spirit,
c18233	and made his heart obstinate,
c18234	that he might deliver him into thy hand,
c18235	as <i>appeareth</i> this day.
c18236	And the LORD said unto
c18237	me, Behold,
c18238	I have begun
c18239	to give Sihon and his land before
c18240	thee: begin
c18241	to possess,
c18242	that thou mayest inherit his land.
c18243	Then Sihon came out
c18244	against
c18245	us, he and all his people, to fight at Jahaz.
c18246	And the LORD our God delivered him before
c18247	us; and we smote him, and his sons, and all his people.
c18248	And we took all his cities at that time,
c18249	and utterly destroyed the men, and the women, and the little ones, of every city,
c18250	we left none to remain:
c18251	Only the cattle we took for a prey
c18252	unto ourselves, and the spoil of the cities
c18253	which we took.
c18254	From Aroer,
c18255	which <i>is</i> by the brink of the river of Arnon,
c18256	and <i>from</i> the city
c18257	that <i>is</i> by the river,
c18258	even unto Gilead, there was not one city
c18259	too strong for
c18260	us: the LORD our God delivered all unto us:
c18261	Only unto the land of the children of Ammon thou camest not, <i>nor</i> unto any place of the river Jabbok, nor unto the cities in the mountains, nor unto whatsoever
c18262	the LORD our God forbad us.
c18263	Then we turned,
c18264	and went up the way to Bashan:
c18265	and Og the king of Bashan came out
c18266	against
c18267	us, he and all his people, to battle at Edrei.
c18268	And the LORD said unto
c18269	me, Fear him not:
c18270	for I will deliver him, and all his people, and his land, into thy hand;
c18271	and thou shalt do
c18272	unto him as thou didst unto Sihon king of the Amorites,
c18273	which dwelt at Heshbon.
c18274	So the LORD our God delivered into our hands Og also, the king of Bashan, and all his people:
c18275	and we smote
c18276	him until none was left to him remaining.
c18277	And we took all his cities at that time,
c18278	there was not a city
c18279	which we took not from
c18280	them, threescore cities, all the region of Argob, the kingdom of Og in Bashan.
c18281	All these cities <i>were</i> fenced with high walls, gates, and bars; beside unwalled towns a great many.
c18282	And we utterly destroyed
c18283	them, as we did unto Sihon king of Heshbon,
c18284	utterly destroying the men, women, and children, of every city.
c18285	But all the cattle, and the spoil of the cities, we took for a prey to ourselves.
c18286	And we took at that time out of the hand of the two kings of the Amorites the land
c18287	that <i>was</i> on this side Jordan,
c18288	from the river of Arnon unto mount Hermon;
c18289	<i>(Which</i> Hermon the Sidonians call Sirion;
c18290	and the Amorites call it Shenir;)
c18291	All the cities of the plain, and all Gilead, and all Bashan, unto Salchah and Edrei, cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan.
c18292	For only Og king of Bashan remained of the remnant of giants;
c18293	behold, his bedstead <i>was</i> a bedstead of iron;
c18294	<i>is</i> it not in Rabbath of the children of Ammon?
c18295	nine cubits <i>was</i> the length
c18296	thereof, and four cubits the breadth of it, after the cubit of a man.
c18297	And this land, <i>which</i> we possessed at that time,
c18298	from Aroer,
c18299	which <i>is</i> by the river Arnon,
c18300	and half mount Gilead, and the cities thereof, gave I unto the Reubenites and to the Gadites.
c18301	And the rest of Gilead, and all Bashan, <i>being</i> the kingdom of Og, gave I unto the half tribe of Manasseh; all the region of Argob,
c18302	with all Bashan, which was called the land of giants.
c18303	Jair the son of Manasseh took all the country of Argob unto the coasts of Geshuri and Maachathi;
c18304	and called them after his own name,
c18305	Bashanhavothjair, unto this day.
c18306	And I gave Gilead unto Machir.
c18307	And unto the Reubenites and unto the Gadites I gave from Gilead even unto the river Arnon half the valley, and the border
c18308	even unto the river Jabbok, <i>which is</i> the border of the children of Ammon;
c18309	The plain also, and Jordan, and the coast <i>thereof,</i> from Chinnereth even unto the sea of the plain, <i>even</i> the salt sea, under Ashdothpisgah eastward.
c18310	And I commanded you at that time,
c18311	saying,
c18312	The LORD your God hath given you this land
c18313	to possess
c18314	it: ye shall pass over armed before your brethren the children of Israel,
c18315	all <i>that are</i> meet for the war.
c18316	But your wives, and your little ones, and your cattle,
c18317	<i>(for</i> I know
c18318	that ye have much cattle,)
c18319	shall abide in your cities
c18320	which I have given you;
c18321	Until the LORD have given rest unto your brethren,
c18322	as well as unto you, and <i>until</i> they also possess the land
c18323	which the LORD your God hath given them beyond Jordan:
c18324	and <i>then</i> shall ye return
c18325	every man unto his possession,
c18326	which I have given you.
c18327	And I commanded Joshua at that time,
c18328	saying,
c18329	Thine eyes
c18330	have seen all
c18331	that the LORD your God hath done unto these two kings:
c18332	so shall the LORD do unto all the kingdoms
c18333	whither thou passest.
c18334	Ye shall not fear
c18335	them: for the LORD your God
c18336	he
c18337	shall fight for you.
c18338	And I besought the LORD at that time,
c18339	saying,
c18340	O Lord GOD,
c18341	thou hast begun
c18342	to shew thy servant thy greatness, and thy mighty hand:
c18343	for what God <i>is there</i> in heaven or in earth,
c18344	that can do according to thy works, and according to thy might?
c18345	I pray thee, let me go over,
c18346	and see the good land
c18347	that <i>is</i> beyond Jordan,
c18348	that goodly mountain, and Lebanon.
c18349	But the LORD was wroth with me for your sakes,
c18350	and would not hear
c18351	me: and the LORD said unto
c18352	me, Let it suffice
c18354	thee; speak no more unto me of this matter.
c18355	Get thee up into the top of Pisgah,
c18356	and lift up thine eyes westward, and northward, and southward, and eastward,
c18357	and behold <i>it</i> with thine eyes:
c18358	for thou shalt not go over this Jordan.
c18359	But charge Joshua,
c18360	and encourage
c18361	him, and strengthen
c18362	him: for he shall go over before this people,
c18363	and he shall cause them to inherit the land
c18364	which thou shalt see.
c18365	So we abode in the valley over against Bethpeor.
c18366	Now therefore hearken, O Israel,
c18367	unto the statutes and unto the judgments,
c18368	which I teach
c18369	you, for to do
c18370	<i>them,</i> that ye may live,
c18371	and go in
c18372	and possess the land
c18373	which the LORD God of your fathers giveth you.
c18374	Ye shall not add unto the word
c18375	which I command
c18376	you, neither shall ye diminish <i>ought</i> from
c18377	it, that ye may keep the commandments of the LORD your God
c18378	which I command you.
c18379	Your eyes
c18380	have seen
c18381	what the LORD did because of Baalpeor:
c18382	for all the men
c18383	that followed Baalpeor,
c18384	the LORD thy God hath destroyed them from among you.
c18385	But ye
c18386	that did cleave unto the LORD your God
c18387	<i>are</i> alive every one of you this day.
c18388	Behold,
c18389	I have taught you statutes and judgments,
c18390	even as the LORD my God commanded
c18391	me, that ye should do so in the land
c18392	whither ye go
c18393	to possess it.
c18394	Keep
c18395	therefore and do
c18396	<i>them;</i> for this <i>is</i> your wisdom and your understanding in the sight of the nations,
c18397	which shall hear all these statutes,
c18398	and say,
c18399	Surely this great nation <i>is</i> a wise and understanding people.
c18400	For what nation <i>is there so</i> great,
c18401	who <i>hath</i> God
c18402	<i>so</i> nigh unto
c18403	them, as the LORD our God <i>is</i> in all
c18404	<i>things that</i> we call upon him <i>for?</i>
c18405	And what nation <i>is there so</i> great,
c18406	that hath statutes and judgments <i>so</i> righteous as all this law,
c18407	which I set before you this day?
c18408	Only take heed
c18409	to thyself, and keep thy soul diligently,
c18410	lest thou forget the things
c18411	which thine eyes have seen,
c18412	and lest they depart from thy heart all the days of thy life:
c18413	but teach them thy sons, and thy sons' sons;
c18414	<i>Specially</i> the day
c18415	that thou stoodest before the LORD thy God in Horeb,
c18416	when the LORD said unto
c18417	me, Gather me the people together,
c18418	and I will make them hear my words,
c18419	that they may learn
c18420	to fear me all the days
c18421	that they shall live upon the earth,
c18422	and <i>that</i> they may teach their children.
c18423	And ye came near
c18424	and stood under the mountain;
c18425	and the mountain burned with fire unto the midst of heaven, with darkness, clouds, and thick darkness.
c18426	And the LORD spake unto you out of the midst of the fire:
c18427	ye heard the voice of the words,
c18428	but saw no similitude;
c18429	only <i>ye heard</i> a voice.
c18430	And he declared unto you his covenant,
c18431	which he commanded
c18432	you to perform,
c18433	<i>even</i> ten commandments;
c18434	and he wrote them upon two tables of stone.
c18435	And the LORD commanded me at that time
c18436	to teach you statutes and judgments,
c18437	that ye might do them in the land
c18438	whither ye go over
c18439	to possess it.
c18440	Take ye therefore good heed unto yourselves;
c18441	for ye saw no manner of similitude on the day
c18442	<i>that</i> the LORD spake unto you in Horeb out of the midst of the fire:
c18443	Lest ye corrupt
c18444	<i>yourselves,</i> and make you a graven image, the similitude of any figure, the likeness of male or female,
c18445	The likeness of any beast
c18446	that <i>is</i> on the earth,
c18447	the likeness of any winged fowl
c18448	that flieth in the air,
c18449	The likeness of any thing
c18450	that creepeth on the ground,
c18451	the likeness of any fish
c18452	that <i>is</i> in the waters beneath the earth:
c18453	And lest thou lift up thine eyes unto heaven,
c18454	and when thou seest the sun, and the moon, and the stars, <i>even</i> all the host of heaven,
c18455	shouldest be driven
c18456	to worship
c18457	them, and serve
c18458	them, which the LORD thy God hath divided unto all nations under the whole heaven.
c18459	But the LORD hath taken
c18460	you, and brought you forth out of the iron furnace, <i>even</i> out of Egypt,
c18461	to be unto him a people of inheritance,
c18462	as <i>ye are</i> this day.
c18463	Furthermore the LORD was angry with me for your sakes,
c18464	and sware
c18465	that I should not go over Jordan,
c18466	and that I should not go in unto that good land,
c18467	which the LORD thy God giveth thee <i>for</i> an inheritance:
c18468	But I must die in this land,
c18469	I must not go over Jordan:
c18470	but ye shall go over,
c18471	and possess that good land.
c18472	Take heed
c18473	unto yourselves, lest ye forget the covenant of the LORD your God,
c18474	which he made with
c18475	you, and make you a graven image, <i>or</i> the likeness of any
c18476	<i>thing,</i> which the LORD thy God hath forbidden thee.
c18477	For the LORD thy God
c18478	<i>is</i> a consuming fire,
c18479	<i>even</i> a jealous God.
c18480	When thou shalt beget children, and children's children,
c18481	and ye shall have remained long in the land,
c18482	and shall corrupt
c18483	<i>yourselves,</i> and make a graven image, <i>or</i> the likeness of any
c18484	<i>thing,</i> and shall do
c18485	evil in the sight of the LORD thy God,
c18486	to provoke him to anger:
c18487	I call heaven and earth to witness against you this day,
c18488	that ye shall soon utterly perish from off the land
c18489	whereunto ye go over Jordan
c18490	to possess
c18491	it; ye shall not prolong <i>your</i> days upon
c18492	it, but shall utterly be destroyed.
c18493	And the LORD shall scatter you among the nations,
c18494	and ye shall be left few in number among the heathen,
c18495	whither the LORD shall lead you.
c18496	And there ye shall serve gods, the work of men's hands, wood and stone,
c18497	which neither see,
c18498	nor hear,
c18499	nor eat,
c18500	nor smell.
c18501	But if from thence thou shalt seek the LORD thy God,
c18502	thou shalt find
c18503	<i>him,</i> if thou seek him with all thy heart and with all thy soul.
c18504	When thou art in tribulation,
c18505	and all these things are come upon thee, <i>even</i> in the latter days,
c18506	if thou turn to the LORD thy God,
c18507	and shalt be obedient unto his voice;
c18508	(For the LORD thy God <i>is</i> a merciful God;)
c18509	he will not forsake
c18510	thee, neither destroy
c18511	thee, nor forget the covenant of thy fathers
c18512	which he sware unto them.
c18513	For ask now of the days that are past,
c18514	which were before
c18515	thee, since the day
c18516	that God created man upon the earth,
c18517	and <i>ask</i> from the one side of heaven unto the other,
c18518	whether there hath been <i>any such thing</i> as this great thing
c18519	<i>is,</i> or hath been heard like it?
c18520	Did <i>ever</i> people hear the voice of God
c18521	speaking out of the midst of the fire,
c18522	as thou hast heard,
c18523	and live?
c18524	Or hath God assayed
c18525	to go
c18526	<i>and</i> take him a nation from the midst of <i>another</i> nation, by temptations, by signs, and by wonders, and by war, and by a mighty hand, and by a stretched out arm, and by great terrors, according to all
c18527	that the LORD your God did for you in Egypt before your eyes?
c18528	Unto thee it was shewed,
c18529	that thou mightest know
c18530	that the LORD
c18531	he <i>is</i> God;
c18532	<i>there is</i> none else beside him.
c18533	Out of heaven he made thee to hear his voice,
c18534	that he might instruct
c18535	thee: and upon earth he shewed thee his great fire;
c18536	and thou heardest his words out of the midst of the fire.
c18537	And because he loved thy fathers,
c18538	therefore he chose their seed after
c18539	them, and brought thee out in his sight with his mighty power out of Egypt;
c18540	To drive out nations from before thee greater and mightier than
c18541	thou <i>art,</i> to bring thee in,
c18542	to give thee their land <i>for</i> an inheritance,
c18543	as <i>it is</i> this day.
c18544	Know therefore this day,
c18545	and consider <i>it</i> in thine heart,
c18546	that the LORD
c18547	he <i>is</i> God in heaven above, and upon the earth beneath:
c18548	<i>there is</i> none else.
c18549	Thou shalt keep therefore his statutes, and his commandments,
c18550	which I command thee this day,
c18551	that it may go well with thee, and with thy children after
c18552	thee, and that thou mayest prolong <i>thy</i> days upon the earth,
c18553	which the LORD thy God giveth thee, for ever.
c18554	Then Moses severed three cities on this side Jordan toward the sunrising;
c18555	That the slayer might flee thither,
c18556	which should kill his neighbour unawares,
c18557	and hated him not in times past;
c18558	and that fleeing unto one of these cities
c18559	he might live:
c18560	<i>Namely,</i> Bezer in the wilderness, in the plain country, of the Reubenites;
c18561	and Ramoth in Gilead, of the Gadites;
c18562	and Golan in Bashan, of the Manassites.
c18563	And this <i>is</i> the law
c18564	which Moses set before the children of Israel:
c18565	These <i>are</i> the testimonies, and the statutes, and the judgments,
c18566	which Moses spake unto the children of Israel,
c18567	after they came forth out of Egypt,
c18568	On this side Jordan, in the valley over against Bethpeor, in the land of Sihon king of the Amorites,
c18569	who dwelt at Heshbon,
c18570	whom Moses and the children of Israel smote,
c18571	after they were come forth out of Egypt:
c18572	And they possessed his land, and the land of Og king of Bashan, two kings of the Amorites,
c18573	which <i>were</i> on this side Jordan toward the sunrising;
c18574	From Aroer,
c18575	which <i>is</i> by the bank of the river Arnon,
c18576	even unto mount Sion,
c18577	which <i>is</i> Hermon,
c18578	And all the plain on this side Jordan eastward, even unto the sea of the plain, under the springs of Pisgah.
c18579	And Moses called all Israel,
c18580	and said unto
c18581	them, Hear,
c18582	O Israel,
c18583	the statutes and judgments
c18584	which I speak in your ears this day,
c18585	that ye may learn
c18586	them, and keep,
c18587	and do them.
c18588	The LORD our God made a covenant with us in Horeb.
c18589	The LORD made not this covenant with our fathers,
c18590	but with us, <i>even</i> us,
c18591	who <i>are</i> all of us here alive this day.
c18592	The LORD talked with you face to face in the mount out of the midst of the fire,
c18593	(I stood between the LORD and you at that time,
c18594	to shew you the word of the LORD:
c18595	for ye were afraid by reason of the fire,
c18596	and went not up into the mount;)
c18597	saying,
c18598	I <i>am</i> the LORD thy God,
c18599	which brought thee out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage.
c18600	Thou shalt have none other gods before me.
c18601	Thou shalt not make thee <i>any</i> graven image, <i>or</i> any likeness
c18602	<i>of any thing</i> that <i>is</i> in heaven above,
c18603	or that <i>is</i> in the earth beneath,
c18604	or that <i>is</i> in the waters beneath the earth:
c18605	Thou shalt not bow down thyself
c18606	unto them, nor serve
c18607	them: for I the LORD thy God <i>am</i> a jealous God,
c18608	visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth <i>generation</i> of them that hate me,
c18609	And shewing mercy unto thousands of them that love me and keep my commandments.
c18610	Thou shalt not take the name of the LORD thy God in vain:
c18611	for the LORD will not hold <i>him</i> guiltless
c18612	that taketh his name in vain.
c18613	Keep the sabbath day
c18614	to sanctify
c18615	it, as the LORD thy God hath commanded thee.
c18616	Six days thou shalt labour,
c18617	and do all thy work:
c18618	But the seventh day <i>is</i> the sabbath of the LORD thy God:
c18619	<i>in it</i> thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, nor thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thine ox, nor thine ass, nor any of thy cattle, nor thy stranger
c18620	that <i>is</i> within thy gates;
c18621	that thy manservant and thy maidservant may rest as well as thou.
c18622	And remember
c18623	that thou wast a servant in the land of Egypt,
c18624	and <i>that</i> the LORD thy God brought thee out thence through a mighty hand and by a stretched out arm:
c18625	therefore the LORD thy God commanded
c18626	thee to keep the sabbath day.
c18627	Honour thy father and thy mother,
c18628	as the LORD thy God hath commanded
c18629	thee; that thy days may be prolonged,
c18630	and that it may go well with thee, in the land
c18631	which the LORD thy God giveth thee.
c18632	Thou shalt not kill.
c18633	Neither shalt thou commit adultery.
c18634	Neither shalt thou steal.
c18635	Neither shalt thou bear false witness against thy neighbour.
c18636	Neither shalt thou desire thy neighbour's wife,
c18637	neither shalt thou covet thy neighbour's house, his field, or his manservant, or his maidservant, his ox, or his ass, or any
c18638	<i>thing</i> that <i>is</i> thy neighbour's.
c18639	These words the LORD spake unto all your assembly in the mount out of the midst of the fire, of the cloud, and of the thick darkness, with a great voice:
c18640	and he added no more.
c18641	And he wrote them in two tables of stone,
c18642	and delivered them unto me.
c18643	And it came to pass,
c18644	when ye heard the voice out of the midst of the darkness,
c18645	(for the mountain did burn with fire,)
c18646	that ye came near unto
c18647	me, <i>even</i> all the heads of your tribes, and your elders;
c18648	And ye said,
c18649	Behold, the LORD our God hath shewed us his glory and his greatness,
c18650	and we have heard his voice out of the midst of the fire:
c18651	we have seen this day
c18652	that God doth talk with man,
c18653	and he liveth.
c18654	Now
c18655	therefore why should we die?
c18656	for this great fire will consume
c18657	us: if we hear the voice of the LORD our God any more,
c18659	then we shall die.
c18660	For who <i>is there of</i> all flesh,
c18661	that hath heard the voice of the living God
c18662	speaking out of the midst of the fire,
c18663	as we
c18664	<i>have,</i> and lived?
c18665	Go thou near,
c18666	and hear all
c18667	that the LORD our God shall say:
c18668	and speak thou unto us all
c18669	that the LORD our God shall speak unto
c18670	thee; and we will hear
c18671	<i>it,</i> and do <i>it.</i>
c18672	And the LORD heard the voice of your words,
c18673	when ye spake unto
c18674	me; and the LORD said unto
c18675	me, I have heard the voice of the words of this people,
c18676	which they have spoken unto
c18677	thee: they have well said all
c18678	that they have spoken.
c18679	O that
c18680	there were such an heart
c18681	in them, that they would fear
c18682	me, and keep all my commandments always,
c18683	that it might be well with them, and with their children for ever!
c18684	Go
c18685	say
c18686	to them, Get you into your tents again.
c18687	But as for thee,
c18688	stand thou here by
c18689	me, and I will speak unto thee all the commandments, and the statutes, and the judgments,
c18690	which thou shalt teach
c18691	them, that they may do <i>them</i> in the land
c18692	which I give
c18693	them to possess it.
c18694	Ye shall observe
c18695	to do
c18696	therefore as the LORD your God hath commanded
c18697	you: ye shall not turn aside to the right hand or to the left.
c18698	in all the ways
c18699	which the LORD your God hath commanded
c18700	Ye shall walk
c18701	you, that ye may live,
c18702	and <i>that it may be</i> well
c18703	with you, and <i>that</i> ye may prolong <i>your</i> days in the land
c18704	which ye shall possess.
c18705	Now these <i>are</i> the commandments, the statutes, and the judgments,
c18706	which the LORD your God commanded
c18707	to teach
c18708	you, that ye might do <i>them</i> in the land
c18709	whither ye go
c18710	to possess it:
c18711	That thou mightest fear the LORD thy God,
c18712	to keep all his statutes and his commandments,
c18713	which I command
c18714	thee, thou, and thy son, and thy son's son, all the days of thy life;
c18715	and that thy days may be prolonged.
c18716	Hear
c18717	therefore, O Israel,
c18718	and observe
c18719	to do
c18720	<i>it;</i> that it may be well
c18721	with thee, and that ye may increase mightily,
c18722	as the LORD God of thy fathers hath promised
c18723	thee, in the land that floweth with milk and honey.
c18724	Hear,
c18725	O Israel:
c18726	The LORD our God
c18727	<i>is</i> one LORD:
c18728	And thou shalt love the LORD thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy might.
c18729	And these words, which I command thee this day, shall be
c18731	in thine heart:
c18732	And thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children,
c18733	and shalt talk
c18734	of them when thou sittest in thine house,
c18735	and when thou walkest by the way,
c18736	and when thou liest down,
c18737	and when thou risest up.
c18738	And thou shalt bind them for a sign upon thine hand,
c18739	and they shall be as frontlets between thine eyes.
c18740	And thou shalt write them upon the posts of thy house,
c18741	and on thy gates.
c18742	And it shall be,
c18743	when the LORD thy God shall have brought thee into the land
c18744	which he sware unto thy fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob,
c18745	to give
c18746	thee great and goodly cities,
c18747	which thou buildedst not,
c18748	And houses
c18749	full of all good
c18750	<i>things,</i> which thou filledst not,
c18751	and wells digged,
c18752	which thou diggedst not,
c18753	vineyards and olive trees,
c18754	which thou plantedst not;
c18755	when thou shalt have eaten
c18756	and be full;
c18757	<i>Then</i> beware
c18758	lest thou forget the LORD,
c18759	which brought thee forth out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage.
c18760	Thou shalt fear the LORD thy God,
c18761	and serve
c18762	him, and shalt swear by his name.
c18763	Ye shall not go after other gods, of the gods of the people
c18764	which <i>are</i> round about you;
c18765	(For the LORD thy God <i>is</i> a jealous God among
c18766	you) lest the anger of the LORD thy God be kindled
c18767	against thee, and destroy thee from off the face of the earth.
c18768	Ye shall not tempt the LORD your God,
c18769	as ye tempted <i>him</i> in Massah.
c18770	Ye shall diligently keep the commandments of the LORD your God, and his testimonies, and his statutes,
c18771	which he hath commanded thee.
c18772	And thou shalt do <i>that which is</i> right and good in the sight of the LORD:
c18773	that it may be well
c18774	with thee, and that thou mayest go in
c18775	and possess the good land
c18776	which the LORD sware unto thy fathers,
c18777	To cast out all thine enemies from before
c18778	thee, as the LORD hath spoken.
c18779	<i>And</i> when thy son asketh thee in time to come,
c18780	saying,
c18781	What <i>mean</i> the testimonies, and the statutes, and the judgments,
c18782	which the LORD our God hath commanded you?
c18783	Then thou shalt say unto thy son,
c18784	We were Pharaoh's bondmen in Egypt;
c18785	and the LORD brought us out of Egypt with a mighty hand:
c18786	And the LORD shewed signs and wonders, great and sore, upon Egypt, upon Pharaoh, and upon all his household, before our eyes:
c18787	And he brought us out from thence,
c18788	that he might bring us in,
c18789	to give us the land
c18790	which he sware unto our fathers.
c18791	And the LORD commanded
c18792	us to do all these statutes,
c18793	to fear the LORD our God,
c18794	for our good always,
c18795	that he might preserve us alive,
c18796	as <i>it is</i> at this day.
c18797	And it shall be our righteousness,
c18798	if we observe
c18799	to do all these commandments before the LORD our God,
c18800	as he hath commanded us.
c18801	When the LORD thy God shall bring thee into the land
c18802	whither thou goest
c18803	to possess
c18804	it, and hath cast out many nations before thee, the Hittites, and the Girgashites, and the Amorites, and the Canaanites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, seven nations
c18805	greater and mightier than thou;
c18806	And when the LORD thy God shall deliver them before
c18807	thee; thou shalt smite
c18808	them, <i>and</i> utterly destroy
c18809	them; thou shalt make no covenant
c18810	with them, nor shew mercy unto them:
c18811	Neither shalt thou make marriages
c18812	with them; thy daughter thou shalt not give unto his son,
c18813	nor his daughter shalt thou take unto thy son.
c18814	For they will turn away thy son from following
c18815	me, that they may serve other gods:
c18816	so will the anger of the LORD be kindled
c18817	against you, and destroy thee suddenly.
c18818	But thus shall ye deal
c18819	with them; ye shall destroy their altars,
c18820	and break down their images,
c18821	and cut down their groves,
c18822	and burn their graven images with fire.
c18823	For thou <i>art</i> an holy people unto the LORD thy God:
c18824	the LORD thy God hath chosen
c18825	thee to be a special people
c18826	unto himself, above all people
c18827	that <i>are</i> upon the face of the earth.
c18829	you, because ye were more in number than any people;
c18830	The LORD did not set his love
c18831	upon you, nor choose
c18832	for ye <i>were</i> the fewest of all people:
c18833	But
c18834	because the LORD loved
c18835	you, and because he would keep the oath
c18836	which he had sworn unto your fathers,
c18837	hath the LORD brought you out with a mighty hand,
c18838	and redeemed you out of the house of bondmen, from the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt.
c18839	Know
c18840	therefore that the LORD thy God,
c18841	he <i>is</i> God, the faithful God,
c18842	which keepeth covenant and mercy with them that love him and keep his commandments to a thousand generations;
c18843	And repayeth them that hate him to their face,
c18844	to destroy
c18845	them: he will not be slack to him that hateth
c18846	him, he will repay him to his face.
c18847	Thou shalt therefore keep the commandments, and the statutes, and the judgments,
c18848	which I command thee this day,
c18849	to do them.
c18850	Wherefore it shall come to pass,
c18851	if ye hearken to these judgments,
c18852	and keep,
c18853	and do
c18854	them, that the LORD thy God shall keep unto thee the covenant and the mercy
c18855	which he sware unto thy fathers:
c18856	And he will love
c18857	thee, and bless
c18858	thee, and multiply
c18859	thee: he will also bless the fruit of thy womb, and the fruit of thy land, thy corn, and thy wine, and thine oil, the increase of thy kine, and the flocks of thy sheep, in the land
c18860	which he sware unto thy fathers
c18861	to give thee.
c18862	Thou shalt be blessed above all people:
c18863	there shall not be male or female barren
c18864	among you, or among your cattle.
c18865	And the LORD will take away from thee all sickness,
c18866	none of the evil diseases of Egypt,
c18867	which thou knowest,
c18868	and will put
c18869	upon thee; but will lay them upon all <i>them</i> that hate thee.
c18870	And thou shalt consume all the people
c18871	which the LORD thy God shall deliver
c18872	thee; thine eye shall have no pity upon
c18873	them: neither shalt thou serve their gods;
c18874	for that <i>will be</i> a snare unto thee.
c18875	If thou shalt say in thine heart,
c18876	These nations <i>are</i> more than
c18877	I; how can
c18878	I dispossess them?
c18879	Thou shalt not be afraid of
c18880	them: <i>but</i> shalt well remember
c18881	what the LORD thy God did unto Pharaoh, and unto all Egypt;
c18882	The great temptations
c18883	which thine eyes saw,
c18884	and the signs, and the wonders, and the mighty hand, and the stretched out arm,
c18885	whereby the LORD thy God brought thee out:
c18886	so shall the LORD thy God do unto all the people
c18887	of whom thou art afraid.
c18888	Moreover the LORD thy God will send the hornet
c18889	among them, until they that are left, and hide themselves from thee, be destroyed.
c18890	Thou shalt not be affrighted at
c18891	them: for the LORD thy God <i>is</i> among
c18892	you, a mighty God and terrible.
c18893	And the LORD thy God will put out those nations before thee by little and little:
c18894	thou mayest not
c18895	consume them at once,
c18896	lest the beasts of the field increase upon thee.
c18897	But the LORD thy God shall deliver them unto
c18898	thee, and shall destroy them with a mighty destruction,
c18899	until they be destroyed.
c18900	And he shall deliver their kings into thine hand,
c18901	and thou shalt destroy their name from under heaven:
c18902	there shall no man be able to stand before
c18903	thee, until thou have destroyed them.
c18904	The graven images of their gods shall ye burn with fire:
c18905	thou shalt not desire the silver or gold <i>that is</i> on
c18906	them, nor take
c18907	<i>it</i> unto thee, lest thou be snared
c18908	therein: for it <i>is</i> an abomination to the LORD thy God.
c18909	Neither shalt thou bring an abomination into thine house,
c18910	lest thou be a cursed thing like it:
c18911	<i>but</i> thou shalt utterly detest
c18912	it, and thou shalt utterly abhor
c18913	it; for it <i>is</i> a cursed thing.
c18914	All the commandments
c18915	which I command thee this day
c18916	shall ye observe
c18917	to do,
c18918	that ye may live,
c18919	and multiply,
c18920	and go in
c18921	and possess the land
c18922	which the LORD sware unto your fathers.
c18923	And thou shalt remember all the way
c18924	which the LORD thy God led thee these forty years in the wilderness,
c18925	to humble
c18926	thee, <i>and</i> to prove
c18927	thee, to know
c18928	what <i>was</i> in thine heart,
c18929	whether thou wouldest keep his commandments,
c18930	or no.
c18931	And he humbled
c18932	thee, and suffered thee to hunger,
c18933	and fed thee with manna,
c18934	which thou knewest not,
c18935	neither did thy fathers know;
c18936	that he might make thee know
c18937	that man doth not live by bread only,
c18938	but by every <i>word</i> that proceedeth out of the mouth of the LORD doth man live.
c18939	Thy raiment waxed not old upon
c18940	thee, neither did thy foot swell, these forty years.
c18941	Thou shalt also consider in thine heart,
c18942	that,
c18943	as a man chasteneth his son,
c18944	<i>so</i> the LORD thy God chasteneth thee.
c18945	Therefore thou shalt keep the commandments of the LORD thy God,
c18946	to walk in his ways,
c18947	and to fear him.
c18948	For the LORD thy God bringeth thee into a good land, a land of brooks of water, of fountains and depths
c18949	that spring out of valleys and hills;
c18950	A land of wheat, and barley, and vines, and fig trees, and pomegranates; a land of oil olive, and honey;
c18951	A land
c18952	wherein thou shalt eat bread without scarceness,
c18953	thou shalt not lack any
c18954	<i>thing</i> in it; a land
c18955	whose stones <i>are</i> iron,
c18956	and out of whose hills thou mayest dig brass.
c18957	When thou hast eaten
c18958	and art full,
c18959	then thou shalt bless the LORD thy God for the good land
c18960	which he hath given thee.
c18961	Beware
c18962	that thou forget not the LORD thy God,
c18963	in not keeping his commandments, and his judgments, and his statutes,
c18964	which I command thee this day:
c18965	Lest <i>when</i> thou hast eaten
c18966	and art full,
c18967	and hast built goodly houses,
c18968	and dwelt <i>therein;</i>
c18969	And <i>when</i> thy herds and thy flocks multiply,
c18970	and thy silver and thy gold is multiplied,
c18971	and all
c18972	that
c18973	thou hast is multiplied;
c18974	Then thine heart be lifted up,
c18975	and thou forget the LORD thy God,
c18976	which brought thee forth out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage;
c18977	Who led thee through that great and terrible wilderness, <i>wherein were</i> fiery serpents, and scorpions, and drought,
c18978	where <i>there was</i> no water;
c18979	who brought thee forth water out of the rock of flint;
c18980	Who fed thee in the wilderness with manna,
c18981	which thy fathers knew not,
c18982	that he might humble
c18983	thee, and that he might prove
c18984	thee, to do thee good at thy latter end;
c18985	And thou say in thine heart,
c18986	My power and the might of <i>mine</i> hand hath gotten me this wealth.
c18987	But thou shalt remember the LORD thy God:
c18988	for <i>it is</i> he
c18989	that giveth thee power
c18990	to get wealth,
c18991	that he may establish his covenant
c18992	which he sware unto thy fathers,
c18993	as <i>it is</i> this day.
c18994	And it shall be,
c18995	if thou do at all forget the LORD thy God,
c18996	and walk after other gods,
c18997	and serve
c18998	them, and worship
c18999	them, I testify against you this day
c19000	that ye shall surely perish.
c19001	As the nations
c19002	which the LORD destroyeth before your face,
c19003	so shall ye perish;
c19004	because ye would not be obedient unto the voice of the LORD your God.
c19005	Hear,
c19006	O Israel:
c19007	Thou <i>art</i> to pass over Jordan this day,
c19008	to go in
c19009	to possess nations
c19010	greater and mightier than
c19011	thyself, cities
c19012	great and fenced up to heaven,
c19013	A people great and tall, the children of the Anakims,
c19014	whom thou knowest,
c19015	and <i>of whom</i> thou hast heard
c19016	<i>say,</i> Who can stand before the children of Anak!
c19017	Understand therefore this day,
c19018	that the LORD thy God
c19019	<i>is</i> he
c19020	which goeth over before
c19021	thee; <i>as</i> a consuming fire
c19022	he shall destroy
c19023	them, and he shall bring them down before thy face:
c19024	so shalt thou drive them out,
c19025	and destroy them quickly,
c19026	as the LORD hath said unto thee.
c19027	Speak not thou in thine heart,
c19028	after that the LORD thy God hath cast them out from before
c19029	thee, saying,
c19030	For my righteousness the LORD hath brought me in
c19031	to possess this land:
c19032	but for the wickedness of these nations the LORD doth drive them out from before thee.
c19033	Not for thy righteousness, or for the uprightness of thine heart, dost thou go
c19034	to possess their land:
c19035	but for the wickedness of these nations the LORD thy God doth drive them out from before
c19036	thee, and that he may perform the word
c19037	which the LORD sware unto thy fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.
c19038	Understand
c19039	therefore, that the LORD thy God giveth thee not this good land to possess it for thy righteousness;
c19041	for thou <i>art</i> a stiffnecked people.
c19042	Remember,
c19043	<i>and</i> forget not,
c19044	how thou provokedst the LORD thy God to wrath in the wilderness:
c19045	from the day
c19046	that thou didst depart out of the land of Egypt,
c19047	until ye came unto this place,
c19048	ye have been rebellious against the LORD.
c19049	Also in Horeb ye provoked the LORD
c19050	to wrath, so that the LORD was angry
c19051	with you to have destroyed you.
c19052	When I was gone up into the mount
c19053	to receive the tables of stone, <i>even</i> the tables of the covenant
c19054	which the LORD made with
c19055	you, then I abode in the mount forty days and forty nights,
c19056	I neither did eat bread
c19057	nor drink water:
c19058	And the LORD delivered unto me two tables of stone
c19059	written with the finger of God;
c19060	and on them <i>was written</i> according to all the words,
c19061	which the LORD spake with you in the mount out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly.
c19062	And it came to pass
c19063	at the end of forty days and forty nights, <i>that</i> the LORD gave me the two tables of stone, <i>even</i> the tables of the covenant.
c19064	And the LORD said unto
c19065	me, Arise,
c19066	get thee down quickly from hence;
c19067	for thy people which thou hast brought forth out of Egypt have corrupted
c19069	<i>themselves;</i> they are quickly turned aside out of the way
c19070	which I commanded
c19071	them; they have made them a molten image.
c19072	Furthermore the LORD spake unto
c19073	me, saying,
c19074	I have seen this people,
c19075	and, behold, it <i>is</i> a stiffnecked people:
c19076	Let me alone,
c19077	that I may destroy
c19078	them, and blot out their name from under heaven:
c19079	and I will make of thee a nation
c19080	mightier and greater than they.
c19081	So I turned
c19082	and came down from the mount,
c19083	and the mount burned with fire:
c19084	and the two tables of the covenant <i>were</i> in my two hands.
c19085	And I looked,
c19086	and, behold,
c19087	ye had sinned against the LORD your God,
c19088	<i>and</i> had made you a molten calf:
c19089	ye had turned aside quickly out of the way
c19090	which the LORD had commanded you.
c19091	And I took the two tables,
c19092	and cast them out of my two hands,
c19093	and brake them before your eyes.
c19094	And I fell down before the LORD, as at the first, forty days and forty nights:
c19095	I did neither eat bread,
c19096	nor drink water, because of all your sins
c19097	which ye sinned,
c19098	in doing
c19099	wickedly in the sight of the LORD,
c19100	to provoke him to anger.
c19101	For I was afraid of the anger and hot displeasure,
c19102	wherewith the LORD was wroth against
c19103	you to destroy
c19104	you. But the LORD hearkened unto me at that time also.
c19105	And the LORD was very angry with Aaron
c19106	to have destroyed
c19107	him: and I prayed for Aaron also the same time.
c19109	which ye had made,
c19110	And I took your sin, the calf
c19111	and burnt it with fire,
c19112	and stamped
c19113	it, <i>and</i> ground <i>it</i> very small,
c19114	<i>even</i> until it was as small as dust:
c19115	and I cast the dust thereof into the brook
c19116	that descended out of the mount.
c19117	And at Taberah, and at Massah, and at Kibrothhattaavah, ye provoked the LORD to wrath.
c19118	Likewise when the LORD sent you from Kadeshbarnea,
c19119	saying,
c19120	Go up
c19121	and possess the land
c19122	which I have given
c19123	you; then ye rebelled against the commandment of the LORD your God,
c19124	and ye believed him not,
c19125	nor hearkened to his voice.
c19126	Ye have been rebellious against the LORD from the day
c19127	that I knew you.
c19128	Thus I fell down before the LORD forty days and forty nights,
c19129	as I fell down
c19130	<i>at the first;</i> because the LORD had said
c19131	he would destroy you.
c19132	I prayed therefore unto the LORD,
c19133	and said,
c19134	O Lord GOD,
c19135	destroy not thy people and thine inheritance,
c19136	which thou hast redeemed through thy greatness,
c19137	which thou hast brought forth out of Egypt with a mighty hand.
c19138	Remember thy servants, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob;
c19139	look not unto the stubbornness of this people, nor to their wickedness, nor to their sin:
c19140	Lest the land whence thou broughtest us out say,
c19142	Because the LORD was not able
c19143	to bring them into the land
c19144	which he promised
c19145	them, and because he hated
c19146	them, he hath brought them out
c19147	to slay them in the wilderness.
c19148	Yet they <i>are</i> thy people and thine inheritance,
c19149	which thou broughtest out by thy mighty power and by thy stretched out arm.
c19150	At that time the LORD said unto
c19151	me, Hew thee two tables of stone like unto the first,
c19152	and come up unto me into the mount,
c19153	and make thee an ark of wood.
c19154	And I will write on the tables the words
c19155	that were in the first tables
c19156	which thou brakest,
c19157	and thou shalt put them in the ark.
c19158	And I made an ark <i>of</i> shittim wood,
c19159	and hewed two tables of stone like unto the first,
c19160	and went up into the mount,
c19161	having the two tables in mine hand.
c19162	And he wrote on the tables, according to the first writing, the ten commandments,
c19163	which the LORD spake unto you in the mount out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly:
c19164	and the LORD gave them unto me.
c19165	And I turned myself
c19166	and came down from the mount,
c19167	and put the tables in the ark
c19168	which I had made;
c19169	and there they be,
c19170	as the LORD commanded me.
c19171	And the children of Israel took their journey from Beeroth of the children of Jaakan to Mosera:
c19172	there Aaron died,
c19173	and there he was buried;
c19174	and Eleazar his son ministered in the priest's office in his stead.
c19175	From thence they journeyed unto Gudgodah;
c19176	and from Gudgodah to Jotbath, a land of rivers of waters.
c19177	At that time the LORD separated the tribe of Levi,
c19178	to bear the ark of the covenant of the LORD,
c19179	to stand before the LORD
c19180	to minister
c19181	unto him, and to bless in his name, unto this day.
c19182	Wherefore Levi hath no part nor inheritance with his brethren;
c19183	the LORD
c19184	<i>is</i> his inheritance,
c19185	according as the LORD thy God promised him.
c19186	And I stayed in the mount, according to the first time, forty days and forty nights;
c19187	and the LORD hearkened unto me at that time also,
c19188	<i>and</i> the LORD would not
c19189	destroy thee.
c19190	And the LORD said unto
c19191	me, Arise,
c19192	take <i>thy</i> journey before the people,
c19193	that they may go in
c19194	and possess the land,
c19195	which I sware unto their fathers
c19196	to give unto them.
c19197	And now,
c19198	Israel,
c19199	what doth the LORD thy God require of
c19200	thee, but
c19201	to fear the LORD thy God,
c19202	to walk in all his ways,
c19203	and to love
c19204	him, and to serve the LORD thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul,
c19205	To keep the commandments of the LORD, and his statutes,
c19206	which I command thee this day
c19207	for thy good?
c19208	Behold,
c19209	the heaven and the heaven of heavens <i>is</i> the LORD'S thy God, the earth <i>also,</i> with all
c19210	that therein <i>is.</i>
c19211	Only the LORD had a delight in thy fathers
c19212	to love
c19213	them, and he chose their seed after them, <i>even</i> you above all people, as <i>it is</i> this day.
c19214	Circumcise therefore the foreskin of your heart,
c19215	and be no more stiffnecked.
c19216	For the LORD your God
c19217	<i>is</i> God of gods, and Lord of lords, a great God, a mighty, and a terrible,
c19218	which regardeth not persons,
c19219	nor taketh reward:
c19220	He doth execute the judgment of the fatherless and widow,
c19221	and loveth the stranger,
c19222	in giving him food and raiment.
c19223	Love ye therefore the stranger:
c19224	for ye were strangers in the land of Egypt.
c19225	Thou shalt fear the LORD thy God;
c19226	him shalt thou serve,
c19227	and to him shalt thou cleave,
c19228	and swear by his name.
c19229	He <i>is</i> thy praise,
c19230	and he <i>is</i> thy God,
c19231	that hath done for thee these great and terrible things,
c19232	which thine eyes have seen.
c19233	Thy fathers went down into Egypt with threescore and ten persons;
c19234	and now the LORD thy God hath made thee as the stars of heaven for multitude.
c19235	Therefore thou shalt love the LORD thy God,
c19236	and keep his charge, and his statutes, and his judgments, and his commandments, alway.
c19237	And know ye this day:
c19238	for <i>I speak</i> not with your children
c19239	which have not known,
c19240	and which have not seen the chastisement of the LORD your God, his greatness, his mighty hand, and his stretched out arm,
c19241	And his miracles, and his acts,
c19242	which he did in the midst of Egypt unto Pharaoh the king of Egypt, and unto all his land;
c19243	And what he did unto the army of Egypt, unto their horses, and to their chariots;
c19244	how he made the water of the Red sea to overflow
c19245	them as they pursued after
c19246	you, and <i>how</i> the LORD hath destroyed them unto this day;
c19247	And what he did unto you in the wilderness,
c19248	until ye came into this place;
c19249	And what he did unto Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, the son of Reuben:
c19250	how the earth opened her mouth,
c19251	and swallowed them up,
c19252	and their households, and their tents, and all the substance
c19253	that <i>was</i> in their possession,
c19254	in the midst of all Israel:
c19255	But your eyes
c19256	have seen all the great acts of the LORD
c19257	which he did.
c19258	Therefore shall ye keep all the commandments
c19259	which I command you this day,
c19260	that ye may be strong,
c19261	and go in
c19262	and possess the land,
c19263	whither ye go
c19264	to possess it;
c19265	And that ye may prolong <i>your</i> days in the land,
c19266	which the LORD sware unto your fathers
c19267	to give unto them and to their seed,
c19268	a land that floweth with milk and honey.
c19269	For the land,
c19270	whither thou goest in
c19271	to possess
c19272	it, <i>is</i> not as the land of Egypt,
c19273	from whence ye came out,
c19274	where thou sowedst thy seed,
c19275	and wateredst <i>it</i> with thy foot, as a garden of herbs:
c19276	But the land,
c19277	whither ye go
c19278	to possess
c19279	it, <i>is</i> a land of hills and valleys,
c19280	<i>and</i> drinketh water of the rain of heaven:
c19281	A land
c19282	which the LORD thy God careth
c19283	for: the eyes of the LORD thy God <i>are</i> always upon it, from the beginning of the year even unto the end of the year.
c19284	And it shall come to pass,
c19285	if ye shall hearken diligently unto my commandments
c19286	which I command you this day,
c19287	to love the LORD your God,
c19288	and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul,
c19289	That I will give <i>you</i> the rain of your land in his due season, the first rain and the latter rain,
c19290	that thou mayest gather in thy corn, and thy wine, and thine oil.
c19291	And I will send grass in thy fields for thy cattle,
c19292	that thou mayest eat
c19293	and be full.
c19294	Take heed
c19295	to yourselves, that your heart be not deceived,
c19296	and ye turn aside,
c19297	and serve other gods,
c19298	and worship them;
c19299	And <i>then</i> the LORD'S wrath be kindled
c19300	against you, and he shut up the heaven,
c19301	that there be no rain,
c19302	and that the land yield not her fruit;
c19303	and <i>lest</i> ye perish quickly from off the good land
c19304	which the LORD giveth you.
c19305	Therefore shall ye lay up these my words in your heart and in your soul,
c19306	and bind them for a sign upon your hand,
c19307	that they may be as frontlets between your eyes.
c19308	And ye shall teach them your children,
c19309	speaking
c19310	of them when thou sittest in thine house,
c19311	and when thou walkest by the way,
c19312	when thou liest down,
c19313	and when thou risest up.
c19314	And thou shalt write them upon the door posts of thine house, and upon thy gates:
c19315	That your days may be multiplied, and the days of your children, in the land
c19316	which the LORD sware unto your fathers
c19317	to give
c19318	them, as the days of heaven upon the earth.
c19319	For if ye shall diligently keep all these commandments
c19320	which I command
c19321	you, to do
c19322	them, to love the LORD your God,
c19323	to walk in all his ways,
c19324	and to cleave unto him;
c19325	Then will the LORD drive out all these nations from before
c19326	you, and ye shall possess greater nations
c19327	and mightier than yourselves.
c19328	Every place
c19329	whereon the soles of your feet shall tread
c19330	shall be
c19331	yours: from the wilderness and Lebanon, from the river, the river Euphrates, even unto the uttermost sea shall your coast be.
c19332	There shall no man be able to stand before
c19333	you: <i>for</i> the LORD your God shall lay the fear of you and the dread of you upon all the land
c19334	that ye shall tread
c19335	upon, as he hath said unto you.
c19336	Behold,
c19337	I set before you this day a blessing and a curse;
c19338	A blessing,
c19339	if ye obey the commandments of the LORD your God,
c19340	which I command you this day:
c19341	And a curse,
c19342	if ye will not obey the commandments of the LORD your God,
c19343	but turn aside out of the way
c19344	which I command you this day,
c19345	to go after other gods,
c19346	which ye have not known.
c19347	And it shall come to pass,
c19348	when the LORD thy God hath brought thee in unto the land
c19349	whither thou goest
c19350	to possess
c19351	it, that thou shalt put the blessing upon mount Gerizim,
c19352	and the curse upon mount Ebal.
c19353	<i>Are</i> they not on the other side Jordan, by the way where the sun goeth down, in the land of the Canaanites,
c19354	which dwell in the champaign over against Gilgal, beside the plains of Moreh?
c19355	For ye shall pass over Jordan
c19356	to go in
c19357	to possess the land
c19358	which the LORD your God giveth
c19359	you, and ye shall possess
c19360	it, and dwell therein.
c19361	And ye shall observe
c19362	to do all the statutes and judgments
c19363	which I set before you this day.
c19364	These <i>are</i> the statutes and judgments,
c19365	which ye shall observe
c19366	to do in the land,
c19367	which the LORD God of thy fathers giveth
c19368	thee to possess
c19369	it, all the days
c19370	that ye live upon the earth.
c19371	Ye shall utterly destroy all the places,
c19372	wherein the nations which ye shall possess served
c19374	their gods, upon the high mountains, and upon the hills, and under every green tree:
c19375	And ye shall overthrow their altars,
c19376	and break their pillars,
c19377	and burn their groves with fire;
c19378	and ye shall hew down the graven images of their gods,
c19379	and destroy the names of them out of that place.
c19380	Ye shall not do so unto the LORD your God.
c19381	But unto the place
c19382	which the LORD your God shall choose out of all your tribes
c19383	to put his name there,
c19384	<i>even</i> unto his habitation
c19385	shall ye seek,
c19386	and thither thou shalt come:
c19387	And thither ye shall bring your burnt offerings, and your sacrifices, and your tithes, and heave offerings of your hand, and your vows, and your freewill offerings, and the firstlings of your herds and of your flocks:
c19388	And there ye shall eat before the LORD your God,
c19389	and ye shall rejoice in all that ye put your hand unto, ye and your households,
c19390	wherein the LORD thy God hath blessed thee.
c19391	Ye shall not do after all
c19392	<i>the things</i> that we do here this day,
c19393	every man whatsoever
c19394	<i>is</i> right in his own eyes.
c19395	For ye are not as yet come to the rest and to the inheritance,
c19396	which the LORD your God giveth you.
c19397	But <i>when</i> ye go over Jordan,
c19398	and dwell in the land
c19399	which the LORD your God giveth you to inherit,
c19400	and <i>when</i> he giveth you rest from all your enemies round about,
c19401	so that ye dwell in safety;
c19402	Then there shall be
c19403	a place
c19404	which the LORD your God shall choose
c19405	to cause his name to dwell there;
c19406	thither shall ye bring all
c19407	that I command
c19408	you; your burnt offerings, and your sacrifices, your tithes, and the heave offering of your hand, and all your choice vows
c19409	which ye vow unto the LORD:
c19410	And ye shall rejoice before the LORD your God, ye, and your sons, and your daughters, and your menservants, and your maidservants, and the Levite
c19411	that <i>is</i> within your gates;
c19412	forasmuch as he hath no part nor inheritance with you.
c19413	Take heed
c19414	to thyself that thou offer not thy burnt offerings in every place
c19415	that thou seest:
c19416	But in the place
c19417	which the LORD shall choose in one of thy tribes,
c19418	there thou shalt offer thy burnt offerings,
c19419	and there thou shalt do all
c19420	that I command thee.
c19421	Notwithstanding thou mayest kill and eat flesh in all thy gates, whatsoever thy soul lusteth after,
c19422	according to the blessing of the LORD thy God
c19423	which he hath given
c19424	thee: the unclean and the clean may eat thereof, as of the roebuck, and as of the hart.
c19425	Only ye shall not eat the blood;
c19426	ye shall pour it upon the earth as water.
c19427	Thou mayest not
c19428	eat within thy gates the tithe of thy corn, or of thy wine, or of thy oil, or the firstlings of thy herds or of thy flock, nor any of thy vows
c19429	which thou vowest,
c19430	nor thy freewill offerings, or heave offering of thine hand:
c19431	But thou must eat them before the LORD thy God in the place
c19432	which the LORD thy God shall choose,
c19433	thou, and thy son, and thy daughter, and thy manservant, and thy maidservant, and the Levite
c19434	that <i>is</i> within thy gates:
c19435	and thou shalt rejoice before the LORD thy God in all that thou puttest thine hands unto.
c19436	Take heed
c19437	to thyself that thou forsake not the Levite as long as thou livest upon the earth.
c19438	When the LORD thy God shall enlarge thy border,
c19439	as he hath promised
c19440	thee, and thou shalt say,
c19441	I will eat flesh,
c19442	because thy soul longeth
c19443	to eat flesh;
c19444	thou mayest eat flesh, whatsoever thy soul lusteth after.
c19445	If the place which the LORD thy God hath chosen
c19447	to put his name there be too far from
c19448	thee, then thou shalt kill of thy herd and of thy flock,
c19449	which the LORD hath given
c19450	thee, as I have commanded
c19451	thee, and thou shalt eat in thy gates whatsoever thy soul lusteth after.
c19452	Even as the roebuck and the hart is eaten,
c19453	so thou shalt eat
c19454	them: the unclean and the clean shall eat <i>of</i> them alike.
c19455	Only be sure
c19456	that thou eat not the blood:
c19457	for the blood
c19458	<i>is</i> the life;
c19459	and thou mayest not eat the life with the flesh.
c19460	Thou shalt not eat
c19461	it; thou shalt pour it upon the earth as water.
c19462	Thou shalt not eat
c19463	it; that it may go well with thee, and with thy children after
c19464	thee, when thou shalt do
c19465	<i>that which is</i> right in the sight of the LORD.
c19466	Only thy holy things
c19467	which thou hast,
c19468	and thy vows, thou shalt take,
c19469	and go unto the place
c19470	which the LORD shall choose:
c19471	And thou shalt offer thy burnt offerings, the flesh and the blood, upon the altar of the LORD thy God:
c19472	and the blood of thy sacrifices shall be poured out upon the altar of the LORD thy God,
c19473	and thou shalt eat the flesh.
c19474	Observe
c19475	and hear all these words
c19476	which I command
c19477	thee, that it may go well with thee, and with thy children after thee for ever,
c19478	when thou doest
c19479	<i>that which is</i> good
c19480	and right in the sight of the LORD thy God.
c19481	When the LORD thy God shall cut off the nations
c19482	thee, whither thou goest
c19483	to possess
c19484	from before
c19485	them, and thou succeedest
c19486	them, and dwellest in their land;
c19487	Take heed
c19488	to thyself that thou be not snared by following
c19489	them, after that they be destroyed from before
c19490	thee; and that thou enquire not after their gods,
c19491	saying,
c19492	How did these nations serve their gods?
c19493	even so will I do likewise.
c19494	Thou shalt not do so unto the LORD thy God:
c19495	for every abomination to the LORD,
c19496	which he hateth,
c19497	have they done unto their gods;
c19498	for even their sons and their daughters they have burnt in the fire to their gods.
c19499	What thing soever
c19500	I command
c19501	you, observe
c19502	to do
c19503	it: thou shalt not add thereto,
c19504	nor diminish from it.
c19505	If there arise among you a prophet, or a dreamer of dreams,
c19506	and giveth thee a sign or a wonder,
c19507	And the sign or the wonder come to pass,
c19508	whereof he spake unto
c19509	thee, saying,
c19510	Let us go after other gods,
c19511	which thou hast not known,
c19512	and let us serve them;
c19513	Thou shalt not hearken unto the words of that prophet, or that dreamer of dreams:
c19514	for the LORD your God proveth
c19515	you, to know
c19516	whether ye love the LORD your God with all your heart and with all your soul.
c19517	Ye shall walk after the LORD your God,
c19518	and fear
c19519	him, and keep his commandments,
c19520	and obey his voice,
c19521	and ye shall serve
c19522	him, and cleave unto him.
c19523	And that prophet, or that dreamer of dreams, shall be put to death;
c19524	because he hath spoken to turn <i>you</i> away from the LORD your God,
c19525	which brought you out of the land of Egypt,
c19526	and redeemed you out of the house of bondage,
c19527	to thrust thee out of the way
c19528	which the LORD thy God commanded
c19529	thee to walk
c19530	in. So shalt thou put the evil away from the midst of thee.
c19531	If thy brother, the son of thy mother, or thy son, or thy daughter, or the wife of thy bosom, or thy friend, which <i>is</i> as thine own soul, entice
c19533	thee secretly,
c19534	saying,
c19535	Let us go
c19536	and serve other gods,
c19537	which thou hast not known, thou, nor thy fathers;
c19538	<i>Namely,</i> of the gods of the people
c19539	which <i>are</i> round about
c19540	you, nigh unto
c19541	thee, or far off from thee, from the <i>one</i> end of the earth even unto the <i>other</i> end of the earth;
c19542	Thou shalt not consent
c19543	unto him, nor hearken unto
c19544	him; neither shall thine eye pity
c19545	him, neither shalt thou spare,
c19546	neither shalt thou conceal him:
c19547	But thou shalt surely kill
c19548	him; thine hand shall be first
c19549	upon him to put him to death,
c19550	and afterwards the hand of all the people.
c19551	And thou shalt stone him with stones,
c19552	that he die;
c19553	because he hath sought
c19554	to thrust thee away from the LORD thy God,
c19555	which brought thee out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage.
c19556	And all Israel shall hear,
c19557	and fear,
c19559	and shall do no more any such wickedness as this is among you.
c19560	If thou shalt hear <i>say</i> in one of thy cities,
c19561	which the LORD thy God hath given
c19562	thee to dwell there,
c19563	saying,
c19564	<i>Certain</i> men, the children of Belial, are gone out from among
c19565	you, and have withdrawn the inhabitants of their city,
c19566	saying,
c19567	Let us go
c19568	and serve other gods,
c19569	which ye have not known;
c19570	Then shalt thou enquire,
c19571	and make search,
c19572	and ask diligently;
c19573	and, behold, <i>if it be</i> truth,
c19574	<i>and</i> the thing certain,
c19575	<i>that</i> such abomination is wrought among you;
c19576	Thou shalt surely smite the inhabitants of that city with the edge of the sword,
c19577	destroying it utterly, and all
c19578	that
c19579	<i>is</i> therein, and the cattle thereof, with the edge of the sword.
c19580	And thou shalt gather all the spoil of it into the midst of the street
c19581	thereof, and shalt burn with fire the city, and all the spoil thereof every whit, for the LORD thy God:
c19582	and it shall be an heap for ever;
c19583	it shall not be built again.
c19584	And there shall cleave nought of the cursed thing to thine hand:
c19585	that the LORD may turn from the fierceness of his anger,
c19586	and shew thee mercy,
c19587	and have compassion
c19588	upon thee, and multiply
c19589	thee, as he hath sworn unto thy fathers;
c19590	When thou shalt hearken to the voice of the LORD thy God,
c19591	to keep all his commandments
c19592	which I command thee this day,
c19593	to do
c19594	<i>that which is</i> right in the eyes of the LORD thy God.
c19595	Ye <i>are</i> the children of the LORD your God:
c19596	ye shall not cut yourselves,
c19597	nor make any baldness between your eyes for the dead.
c19598	For thou <i>art</i> an holy people unto the LORD thy God,
c19599	and the LORD hath chosen
c19600	thee to be a peculiar people
c19601	unto himself, above all the nations
c19602	that <i>are</i> upon the earth.
c19603	Thou shalt not eat any abominable thing.
c19604	These <i>are</i> the beasts
c19605	which ye shall eat:
c19606	the ox, the sheep, and the goat,
c19607	The hart, and the roebuck, and the fallow deer, and the wild goat, and the pygarg, and the wild ox, and the chamois.
c19608	And every beast
c19609	that parteth the hoof,
c19610	and cleaveth the cleft into two claws,
c19611	<i>and</i> cheweth the cud among the beasts,
c19612	that ye shall eat.
c19613	Nevertheless these ye shall not eat of them that chew the cud, or of them that divide the cloven hoof;
c19614	<i>as</i> the camel, and the hare, and the coney:
c19615	for they chew the cud,
c19616	but divide not the hoof;
c19617	<i>therefore</i> they <i>are</i> unclean unto you.
c19618	And the swine,
c19619	because it divideth the hoof,
c19620	yet cheweth not the cud,
c19621	it <i>is</i> unclean
c19622	unto you: ye shall not eat of their flesh,
c19623	nor touch their dead carcase.
c19624	These ye shall eat of all
c19625	that <i>are</i> in the waters:
c19626	all
c19627	that have fins and scales
c19628	shall ye eat:
c19629	And whatsoever
c19630	hath not fins and scales
c19631	ye may not eat;
c19632	it <i>is</i> unclean unto you.
c19633	<i>Of</i> all clean birds ye shall eat.
c19634	But these
c19635	<i>are they</i> of which ye shall not eat:
c19636	the eagle, and the ossifrage, and the ospray,
c19637	And the glede, and the kite, and the vulture after his kind,
c19638	And every raven after his kind,
c19639	And the owl, and the night hawk, and the cuckow, and the hawk after his kind,
c19640	The little owl, and the great owl, and the swan,
c19641	And the pelican, and the gier eagle, and the cormorant,
c19642	And the stork, and the heron after her kind, and the lapwing, and the bat.
c19643	And every creeping thing that flieth
c19644	<i>is</i> unclean
c19645	unto you: they shall not be eaten.
c19646	<i>But of</i> all clean fowls ye may eat.
c19647	Ye shall not eat <i>of</i> any thing that dieth of itself:
c19648	it unto the stranger
c19649	that <i>is</i> in thy gates,
c19650	thou shalt give
c19651	that he may eat
c19652	it; or thou mayest sell it unto an alien:
c19653	for thou <i>art</i> an holy people unto the LORD thy God.
c19654	Thou shalt not seethe a kid in his mother's milk.
c19655	Thou shalt truly tithe all the increase of thy seed,
c19656	that the field bringeth forth year by year.
c19657	And thou shalt eat before the LORD thy God, in the place
c19658	which he shall choose
c19659	to place his name there,
c19660	the tithe of thy corn, of thy wine, and of thine oil, and the firstlings of thy herds and of thy flocks;
c19661	that thou mayest learn
c19662	to fear the LORD thy God always.
c19663	And if the way be too long for
c19664	thee, so that thou art not able
c19665	to carry
c19666	it; <i>or</i> if the place be too far from
c19667	thee, which the LORD thy God shall choose
c19668	to set his name there,
c19669	when the LORD thy God hath blessed thee:
c19670	Then shalt thou turn <i>it</i> into money,
c19671	and bind up the money in thine hand,
c19672	and shalt go unto the place
c19673	which the LORD thy God shall choose:
c19674	And thou shalt bestow that money for whatsoever
c19675	thy soul lusteth after,
c19676	for oxen, or for sheep, or for wine, or for strong drink, or for whatsoever
c19677	thy soul desireth:
c19678	and thou shalt eat there before the LORD thy God,
c19679	and thou shalt rejoice, thou, and thine household,
c19680	And the Levite
c19681	that <i>is</i> within thy gates;
c19682	thou shalt not forsake
c19683	him; for he hath no part nor inheritance with thee.
c19684	At the end of three years thou shalt bring forth all the tithe of thine increase the same year,
c19685	and shalt lay <i>it</i> up within thy gates:
c19686	And the Levite, (because he hath no part nor inheritance with
c19688	thee,) and the stranger, and the fatherless, and the widow,
c19689	which <i>are</i> within thy gates, shall come,
c19690	and shall eat
c19691	and be satisfied;
c19692	that the LORD thy God may bless thee in all the work of thine hand
c19693	which thou doest.
c19694	At the end of <i>every</i> seven years thou shalt make a release.
c19695	And this <i>is</i> the manner of the release:
c19696	Every creditor that lendeth <i>ought</i> unto his neighbour shall release
c19698	<i>it;</i> he shall not exact <i>it</i> of his neighbour, or of his brother;
c19699	because it is called the LORD'S release.
c19700	Of a foreigner thou mayest exact
c19702	<i>it again:</i> but <i>that</i> which is thine with thy brother
c19703	thine hand shall release;
c19704	Save when there shall be no poor
c19705	among you; for the LORD shall greatly bless thee in the land
c19706	which the LORD thy God giveth thee <i>for</i> an inheritance
c19707	to possess it:
c19708	Only
c19709	if thou carefully hearken unto the voice of the LORD thy God,
c19710	to observe
c19711	to do all these commandments
c19712	which I command thee this day.
c19713	For the LORD thy God blesseth
c19714	thee, as he promised
c19715	thee: and thou shalt lend unto many nations,
c19716	but thou shalt not borrow;
c19717	and thou shalt reign over many nations,
c19718	but they shall not reign over thee.
c19719	If there be among you a poor man of one of thy brethren within any of thy gates in thy land
c19720	which the LORD thy God giveth
c19721	thee, thou shalt not harden thine heart,
c19722	nor shut thine hand from thy poor brother:
c19723	But thou shalt open thine hand wide
c19724	unto him, and shalt surely lend him sufficient for his need,
c19725	<i>in that</i> which he wanteth.
c19726	Beware
c19727	that there be not a thought in thy wicked heart,
c19728	saying,
c19729	The seventh year, the year of release, is at hand;
c19730	and thine eye be evil against thy poor brother,
c19731	and thou givest him nought;
c19732	and he cry unto the LORD against
c19733	thee, and it be sin unto thee.
c19734	Thou shalt surely give
c19735	him, and thine heart shall not be grieved
c19736	when thou givest
c19737	unto him: because that for this thing the LORD thy God shall bless thee in all thy works, and in all that thou puttest thine hand unto.
c19738	For the poor shall never cease out of the land:
c19739	therefore I command
c19740	thee, saying,
c19741	Thou shalt open thine hand wide unto thy brother, to thy poor, and to thy needy, in thy land.
c19742	<i>And</i> if thy brother, an Hebrew man, or an Hebrew woman, be sold
c19743	unto thee, and serve thee six years;
c19744	then in the seventh year thou shalt let him go free from thee.
c19746	And when thou sendest him out free from
c19747	thee, thou shalt not let him go away empty:
c19748	Thou shalt furnish him liberally out of thy flock, and out of thy floor, and out of thy winepress:
c19749	<i>of that</i> wherewith the LORD thy God hath blessed
c19750	thee thou shalt give unto him.
c19751	And thou shalt remember
c19752	that thou wast a bondman in the land of Egypt,
c19753	and the LORD thy God redeemed
c19754	thee: therefore I command thee this thing to day.
c19755	And it shall be,
c19756	if he say unto
c19757	thee, I will not go away from
c19758	thee; because he loveth
c19759	thee and thine house,
c19760	because he is well with thee;
c19761	Then thou shalt take an aul,
c19762	and thrust <i>it</i> through his ear unto the door,
c19763	and he shall be thy servant for ever.
c19764	And also unto thy maidservant thou shalt do likewise.
c19765	It shall not seem hard unto thee,
c19766	when thou sendest him away free from
c19767	thee; for he hath been worth a double hired servant <i>to thee,</i> in serving thee six years:
c19768	and the LORD thy God shall bless thee in all
c19769	that thou doest.
c19770	All the firstling
c19772	males that come of thy herd and of thy flock thou shalt sanctify unto the LORD thy God:
c19773	thou shalt do no work with the firstling of thy bullock,
c19774	nor shear the firstling of thy sheep.
c19775	Thou shalt eat <i>it</i> before the LORD thy God year by year in the place
c19776	which the LORD shall choose,
c19777	thou and thy household.
c19778	And if there be <i>any</i> blemish therein, <i>as if it be</i> lame, or blind, <i>or have</i> any ill blemish,
c19779	thou shalt not sacrifice it unto the LORD thy God.
c19780	Thou shalt eat it within thy gates:
c19781	the unclean and the clean <i>person shall eat it</i> alike, as the roebuck, and as the hart.
c19782	Only thou shalt not eat the blood
c19783	thereof; thou shalt pour it upon the ground as water.
c19784	Observe the month of Abib,
c19785	and keep the passover unto the LORD thy God:
c19786	for in the month of Abib the LORD thy God brought thee forth out of Egypt by night.
c19787	Thou shalt therefore sacrifice the passover unto the LORD thy God, of the flock and the herd, in the place
c19788	which the LORD shall choose
c19789	to place his name there.
c19790	Thou shalt eat no leavened bread with
c19791	it; seven days shalt thou eat unleavened bread therewith, <i>even</i> the bread of affliction;
c19792	for thou camest forth out of the land of Egypt in haste:
c19793	that thou mayest remember the day
c19794	when thou camest forth out of the land of Egypt
c19795	all the days of thy life.
c19796	And there shall be no leavened bread seen with thee in all thy coast seven days;
c19797	neither shall there <i>any thing</i> of the flesh, which thou sacrificedst the first day at even, remain all night
c19799	until the morning.
c19800	Thou mayest not
c19801	sacrifice the passover within any of thy gates,
c19802	which the LORD thy God giveth thee:
c19803	But at the place
c19804	which the LORD thy God shall choose
c19805	to place his name in, there
c19806	thou shalt sacrifice the passover at even,
c19807	at the going down of the sun,
c19808	at the season
c19809	that thou camest forth out of Egypt.
c19810	And thou shalt roast
c19811	and eat <i>it</i> in the place
c19812	which the LORD thy God shall choose:
c19813	and thou shalt turn in the morning,
c19814	and go unto thy tents.
c19815	Six days thou shalt eat unleavened bread:
c19816	and on the seventh day <i>shall be</i> a solemn assembly to the LORD thy God:
c19817	thou shalt do no work <i>therein.</i>
c19818	Seven weeks shalt thou number
c19819	unto thee: begin to number the seven weeks from <i>such time as</i> thou beginnest <i>to put</i> the sickle to the corn.
c19822	And thou shalt keep the feast of weeks unto the LORD thy God with a tribute of a freewill offering of thine hand,
c19823	which thou shalt give
c19824	<i>unto the LORD thy God,</i> according as the LORD thy God hath blessed thee:
c19825	And thou shalt rejoice before the LORD thy God, thou, and thy son, and thy daughter, and thy manservant, and thy maidservant, and the Levite
c19826	that <i>is</i> within thy gates,
c19827	and the stranger, and the fatherless, and the widow,
c19828	that <i>are</i> among
c19829	you, in the place
c19830	which the LORD thy God hath chosen
c19831	to place his name there.
c19832	And thou shalt remember
c19833	that thou wast a bondman in Egypt:
c19834	and thou shalt observe
c19835	and do these statutes.
c19836	Thou shalt observe the feast of tabernacles seven days,
c19837	after that thou hast gathered in thy corn and thy wine:
c19838	And thou shalt rejoice in thy feast, thou, and thy son, and thy daughter, and thy manservant, and thy maidservant, and the Levite, the stranger, and the fatherless, and the widow,
c19839	that <i>are</i> within thy gates.
c19840	Seven days shalt thou keep a solemn feast unto the LORD thy God in the place
c19841	which the LORD shall choose:
c19842	because the LORD thy God shall bless thee in all thine increase, and in all the works of thine hands,
c19843	therefore thou shalt surely rejoice.
c19844	Three times in a year shall all thy males appear before the LORD thy God in the place
c19845	which he shall choose;
c19846	in the feast of unleavened bread, and in the feast of weeks, and in the feast of tabernacles:
c19847	and they shall not appear before the LORD empty:
c19848	Every man <i>shall give</i> as he is able, according to the blessing of the LORD thy God
c19849	which he hath given thee.
c19850	Judges and officers shalt thou make thee in all thy gates,
c19851	which the LORD thy God giveth thee, throughout thy tribes:
c19852	and they shall judge the people with just judgment.
c19853	Thou shalt not wrest judgment;
c19854	thou shalt not respect persons,
c19855	neither take a gift:
c19856	for a gift doth blind the eyes of the wise,
c19857	and pervert the words of the righteous.
c19858	That which is altogether just shalt thou follow,
c19859	that thou mayest live,
c19860	and inherit the land
c19861	which the LORD thy God giveth thee.
c19862	Thou shalt not plant thee a grove of any trees near unto the altar of the LORD thy God,
c19863	which thou shalt make thee.
c19864	Neither shalt thou set thee up <i>any</i> image;
c19865	which the LORD thy God hateth.
c19866	Thou shalt not sacrifice unto the LORD thy God <i>any</i> bullock, or sheep,
c19867	wherein is blemish, <i>or</i> any evilfavouredness:
c19868	for that <i>is</i> an abomination unto the LORD thy God.
c19869	If there be found among you, within any of thy gates
c19870	which the LORD thy God giveth
c19871	thee, man or woman,
c19872	that hath wrought
c19873	wickedness in the sight of the LORD thy God,
c19874	in transgressing his covenant,
c19875	And hath gone
c19876	and served other gods,
c19877	and worshipped them, either the sun, or moon, or any of the host of heaven,
c19878	which I have not commanded;
c19879	And it be told
c19880	thee, and thou hast heard
c19881	<i>of it,</i> and enquired diligently,
c19882	and, behold, <i>it be</i> true,
c19883	<i>and</i> the thing certain,
c19884	<i>that</i> such abomination is wrought in Israel:
c19885	Then shalt thou bring forth that man or that woman,
c19886	which have committed that wicked thing,
c19887	unto thy gates,
c19888	<i>even</i> that man or that woman,
c19889	and shalt stone them with stones,
c19890	till they die.
c19891	At the mouth of two witnesses, or three witnesses, shall he that is worthy of death be put to death;
c19892	<i>but</i> at the mouth of one witness he shall not be put to death.
c19893	The hands of the witnesses shall be first
c19894	upon him to put him to death,
c19895	and afterward the hands of all the people.
c19896	So thou shalt put the evil away from among you.
c19897	If there arise a matter too hard for thee in judgment, between blood and blood, between plea and plea, and between stroke and stroke,
c19898	<i>being</i> matters of controversy within thy gates:
c19899	then shalt thou arise,
c19900	and get thee up into the place
c19901	which the LORD thy God shall choose;
c19902	And thou shalt come unto the priests the Levites, and unto the judge
c19903	that shall be in those days,
c19904	and enquire;
c19905	and they shall shew thee the sentence of judgment:
c19906	And thou shalt do according to the sentence,
c19907	which they of that place which the LORD shall choose shall shew
c19909	thee; and thou shalt observe
c19910	to do according to all
c19911	that they inform thee:
c19912	According to the sentence of the law
c19913	which they shall teach
c19914	thee, and according to the judgment
c19915	which they shall tell
c19916	thee, thou shalt do:
c19917	thou shalt not decline from the sentence
c19918	which they shall shew
c19919	thee, <i>to</i> the right hand, nor <i>to</i> the left.
c19920	And the man
c19921	that will do presumptuously,
c19922	and will not hearken unto the priest
c19923	that standeth
c19924	to minister there before the LORD thy God,
c19925	or unto the judge,
c19926	even that man shall die:
c19927	and thou shalt put away the evil from Israel.
c19928	And all the people shall hear,
c19929	and fear,
c19930	and do no more presumptuously.
c19931	When thou art come unto the land
c19932	which the LORD thy God giveth
c19933	thee, and shalt possess
c19934	it, and shalt dwell
c19935	therein, and shalt say,
c19936	I will set a king over me, like as all the nations
c19937	that <i>are</i> about me;
c19938	Thou shalt in any wise set <i>him</i> king over
c19939	thee, whom the LORD thy God shall choose:
c19940	<i>one</i> from among thy brethren shalt thou set king over
c19941	thee: thou mayest not
c19942	set a stranger over
c19943	thee, which <i>is</i> not thy brother.
c19944	But he shall not multiply horses
c19945	to himself, nor cause the people to return to Egypt,
c19946	to the end that he should multiply horses:
c19947	forasmuch as the LORD hath said
c19948	unto you, Ye shall henceforth return no
c19949	more that way.
c19950	Neither shall he multiply wives
c19951	to himself, that his heart turn not away:
c19952	neither shall he greatly multiply to himself silver and gold.
c19953	And it shall be,
c19954	when he sitteth upon the throne of his kingdom,
c19955	that he shall write him a copy of this law in a book out of <i>that which is</i> before the priests the Levites:
c19956	And it shall be with
c19957	him, and he shall read therein all the days of his life:
c19958	that he may learn
c19959	to fear the LORD his God,
c19960	to keep all the words of this law and these statutes,
c19961	to do them:
c19962	That his heart be not lifted up above his brethren,
c19963	and that he turn not aside from the commandment, <i>to</i> the right hand, or <i>to</i> the left:
c19964	to the end that he may prolong <i>his</i> days in his kingdom, he, and his children, in the midst of Israel.
c19965	The priests the Levites, <i>and</i> all the tribe of Levi, shall have no part nor inheritance with Israel:
c19966	they shall eat the offerings of the LORD made by fire, and his inheritance.
c19967	Therefore shall they have no inheritance among their brethren:
c19968	the LORD
c19969	<i>is</i> their inheritance,
c19970	as he hath said unto them.
c19971	And this shall be the priest's due from the people, from them that offer a sacrifice,
c19972	whether <i>it be</i> ox
c19973	or sheep;
c19974	and they shall give unto the priest the shoulder, and the two cheeks, and the maw.
c19975	The firstfruit <i>also</i> of thy corn, of thy wine, and of thine oil, and the first of the fleece of thy sheep, shalt thou give him.
c19976	For the LORD thy God hath chosen him out of all thy tribes,
c19977	to stand
c19978	to minister in the name of the LORD,
c19979	him and his sons for ever.
c19980	And if a Levite come from any of thy gates out of all Israel,
c19981	where he sojourned,
c19982	and come with all the desire of his mind unto the place
c19983	which the LORD shall choose;
c19984	Then he shall minister in the name of the LORD his God, as all his brethren the Levites
c19985	<i>do,</i> which stand there before the LORD.
c19986	They shall have like portions to eat, beside that which cometh of the sale of his patrimony.
c19987	When thou art come into the land
c19988	which the LORD thy God giveth
c19989	thee, thou shalt not learn
c19990	to do after the abominations of those nations.
c19991	There shall not be found
c19992	among you <i>any one</i> that maketh his son or his daughter to pass through the fire,
c19993	<i>or</i> that useth divination,
c19994	<i>or</i> an observer of times, or an enchanter, or a witch,
c19995	Or a charmer,
c19996	or a consulter with familiar spirits, or a wizard,
c19997	or a necromancer.
c19998	For all that do these things <i>are</i> an abomination unto the LORD:
c20000	and because of these abominations the LORD thy God doth drive them out from before thee.
c20001	Thou shalt be perfect with the LORD thy God.
c20002	For these nations,
c20003	which thou shalt possess,
c20004	hearkened unto observers of times, and unto diviners:
c20005	but as for thee,
c20006	the LORD thy God hath not suffered thee so <i>to do.</i>
c20007	The LORD thy God will raise up unto thee a Prophet from the midst of thee, of thy brethren, like unto me;
c20008	unto him ye shall hearken;
c20009	According to all
c20010	that thou desiredst of the LORD thy God in Horeb in the day of the assembly,
c20011	saying,
c20012	Let me not hear again
c20013	the voice of the LORD my God,
c20014	neither let me see this great fire any more,
c20015	that I die not.
c20016	And the LORD said unto
c20017	me, They have well
c20018	<i>spoken that</i> which they have spoken.
c20019	I will raise them up a Prophet from among their brethren, like unto thee,
c20020	and will put my words in his mouth;
c20021	and he shall speak unto them all
c20022	that I shall command him.
c20023	And it shall come to pass,
c20024	<i>that</i> whosoever
c20025	will not hearken unto my words
c20026	which he shall speak in my name,
c20027	I will require <i>it</i> of him.
c20028	But the prophet,
c20029	which shall presume
c20030	to speak a word in my name,
c20031	which I have not commanded
c20032	him to speak,
c20033	or that shall speak in the name of other gods,
c20034	even that prophet shall die.
c20035	And if thou say in thine heart,
c20036	How shall we know the word
c20037	which the LORD hath not spoken?
c20038	When a prophet speaketh in the name of the LORD,
c20039	if the thing follow not,
c20040	nor come to pass,
c20041	that <i>is</i> the thing
c20042	which the LORD hath not spoken,
c20043	<i>but</i> the prophet hath spoken it presumptuously:
c20044	thou shalt not be afraid of him.
c20045	When the LORD thy God hath cut off the nations,
c20046	whose land the LORD thy God giveth
c20047	thee, and thou succeedest
c20048	them, and dwellest in their cities, and in their houses;
c20049	Thou shalt separate three cities for thee in the midst of thy land,
c20050	which the LORD thy God giveth
c20051	thee to possess it.
c20052	Thou shalt prepare thee a way,
c20053	and divide the coasts of thy land,
c20054	which the LORD thy God giveth thee to inherit,
c20056	into three parts, that every slayer may flee thither.
c20057	And this <i>is</i> the case of the slayer,
c20058	which shall flee thither,
c20059	that he may live:
c20060	Whoso killeth his neighbour ignorantly,
c20061	whom he hated not in time past;
c20062	As when a man goeth into the wood with his neighbour
c20063	to hew wood,
c20064	and his hand fetcheth a stroke with the axe
c20065	to cut down the tree,
c20066	and the head slippeth from the helve,
c20067	and lighteth upon his neighbour,
c20068	that he die;
c20069	he shall flee unto one of those cities,
c20070	and live:
c20071	Lest the avenger of the blood pursue the slayer,
c20072	while his heart is hot,
c20073	and overtake
c20074	him, because the way is long,
c20075	and slay him;
c20076	whereas he <i>was</i> not worthy of death,
c20077	inasmuch as he hated him not in time past.
c20078	Wherefore I command
c20079	thee, saying,
c20080	Thou shalt separate three cities for thee.
c20081	And if the LORD thy God enlarge thy coast,
c20082	as he hath sworn unto thy fathers,
c20083	and give thee all the land
c20084	which he promised
c20085	to give unto thy fathers;
c20086	If thou shalt keep all these commandments
c20087	to do
c20088	them, which I command thee this day,
c20089	to love the LORD thy God,
c20090	and to walk ever in his ways;
c20091	then shalt thou add three cities more for thee, beside these three:
c20092	That innocent blood be not shed in thy land,
c20093	which the LORD thy God giveth thee <i>for</i> an inheritance,
c20094	and <i>so</i> blood be upon thee.
c20095	But if any man hate
c20096	his neighbour,
c20097	and lie in wait
c20098	for him, and rise up against
c20099	him, and smite him mortally
c20100	that he die,
c20101	and fleeth into one of these cities:
c20102	Then the elders of his city shall send
c20103	and fetch him thence,
c20104	and deliver him into the hand of the avenger of blood,
c20105	that he may die.
c20106	Thine eye shall not pity
c20107	him, but thou shalt put away <i>the guilt of</i> innocent blood from Israel,
c20108	that it may go well with thee.
c20109	Thou shalt not remove thy neighbour's landmark,
c20110	which they of old time have set in thine inheritance,
c20111	which thou shalt inherit in the land
c20112	that the LORD thy God giveth
c20113	thee to possess it.
c20114	One witness shall not rise up against a man for any iniquity, or for any sin,
c20115	in any sin
c20116	that he sinneth:
c20117	at the mouth of two witnesses, or at the mouth of three witnesses, shall the matter be established.
c20118	If a false witness rise up against any man
c20119	to testify against him <i>that which is</i> wrong;
c20120	Then both the men, between whom the controversy <i>is,</i> shall stand
c20122	before the LORD, before the priests and the judges,
c20123	which shall be in those days;
c20124	And the judges shall make diligent inquisition:
c20125	and, behold, <i>if</i> the witness <i>be</i> a false witness,
c20126	<i>and</i> hath testified falsely against his brother;
c20127	Then shall ye do
c20128	unto him, as he had thought
c20129	to have done unto his brother:
c20130	so shalt thou put the evil away from among you.
c20131	And those which remain shall hear,
c20132	and fear,
c20133	and shall henceforth commit no
c20134	more any such evil among you.
c20135	And thine eye shall not pity;
c20136	<i>but</i> life <i>shall go</i> for life,
c20137	eye for eye,
c20138	tooth for tooth,
c20139	hand for hand,
c20140	foot for foot.
c20141	When thou goest out to battle against thine enemies,
c20142	and seest horses, and chariots, <i>and</i> a people
c20143	more than
c20144	thou, be not afraid
c20146	of them: for the LORD thy God <i>is</i> with thee, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt.
c20147	And it shall be,
c20148	when ye are come nigh unto the battle,
c20149	that the priest shall approach
c20150	and speak unto the people,
c20151	And shall say unto
c20152	them, Hear,
c20153	O Israel,
c20154	ye approach this day unto battle against your enemies:
c20155	let not your hearts faint,
c20156	fear not,
c20157	and do not tremble,
c20158	neither be ye terrified because of them;
c20159	For the LORD your God
c20160	<i>is</i> he that goeth with
c20161	you, to fight for you against your enemies,
c20162	to save you.
c20163	And the officers shall speak unto the people,
c20164	saying,
c20165	What man
c20166	<i>is there</i> that hath built a new house,
c20167	and hath not dedicated
c20168	it? let him go
c20169	and return to his house,
c20170	lest he die in the battle,
c20171	and another man dedicate it.
c20172	And what man
c20173	<i>is he</i> that hath planted a vineyard,
c20174	and hath not <i>yet</i> eaten
c20175	of it? let him <i>also</i> go
c20176	and return unto his house,
c20177	lest he die in the battle,
c20178	and another man eat of it.
c20179	And what man
c20180	<i>is there</i> that hath betrothed a wife,
c20181	and hath not taken
c20182	her? let him go
c20183	and return unto his house,
c20184	lest he die in the battle,
c20185	and another man take her.
c20186	And the officers shall speak further
c20187	unto the people,
c20188	and they shall say,
c20189	What man <i>is there that is</i> fearful and fainthearted?
c20190	let him go
c20191	and return unto his house,
c20192	lest his brethren's heart faint as well as his heart.
c20193	And it shall be,
c20194	when the officers have made an end
c20195	of speaking unto the people,
c20196	that they shall make captains of the armies to lead the people.
c20197	When thou comest nigh unto a city
c20198	to fight against
c20199	it, then proclaim peace unto it.
c20200	And it shall be,
c20201	if it make thee answer of peace,
c20202	and open
c20203	unto thee, then it shall be,
c20204	<i>that</i> all the people
c20205	<i>that is</i> found
c20206	therein shall be tributaries
c20207	unto thee, and they shall serve thee.
c20208	And if it will make no peace with
c20209	thee, but will make war against
c20210	thee, then thou shalt besiege it:
c20211	And when the LORD thy God hath delivered it into thine hands,
c20212	thou shalt smite every male thereof with the edge of the sword:
c20213	But the women, and the little ones, and the cattle, and all
c20214	that is in the city,
c20215	<i>even</i> all the spoil thereof, shalt thou take
c20216	unto thyself; and thou shalt eat the spoil of thine enemies,
c20217	which the LORD thy God hath given thee.
c20218	Thus shalt thou do unto all the cities
c20219	<i>which are</i> very far off from
c20220	thee, which <i>are</i> not of the cities of these nations.
c20221	But of the cities of these people,
c20222	which the LORD thy God doth give thee <i>for</i> an inheritance,
c20223	thou shalt save alive nothing that breatheth:
c20224	But thou shalt utterly destroy them; <i>namely,</i> the Hittites, and the Amorites, the Canaanites, and the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites;
c20225	as the LORD thy God hath commanded thee:
c20226	That they teach you not
c20227	to do after all their abominations,
c20228	which they have done unto their gods;
c20229	so should ye sin against the LORD your God.
c20230	When thou shalt besiege a city a long time,
c20231	in making war against
c20232	it to take
c20233	it, thou shalt not destroy the trees
c20234	thereof by forcing an axe against
c20235	them: for thou mayest eat of
c20236	them, and thou shalt not cut them down
c20237	(for the tree of the field <i>is</i> man's
c20238	<i>life)</i> to employ <i>them</i> in the siege:
c20239	Only the trees
c20240	which thou knowest
c20241	that they <i>be</i> not trees for meat,
c20242	thou shalt destroy
c20243	and cut them down;
c20244	and thou shalt build bulwarks against the city
c20245	that maketh war with
c20246	thee, until it be subdued.
c20247	If <i>one</i> be found slain in the land
c20248	which the LORD thy God giveth
c20249	thee to possess
c20250	it, lying in the field,
c20251	<i>and</i> it be not known
c20252	who hath slain him:
c20253	Then thy elders and thy judges shall come forth,
c20254	and they shall measure unto the cities
c20255	which <i>are</i> round about him that is slain:
c20256	And it shall be,
c20257	<i>that</i> the city
c20258	<i>which is</i> next unto the slain man,
c20259	even the elders of that city shall take an heifer,
c20260	which hath not been wrought
c20261	with, <i>and</i> which hath not drawn in the yoke;
c20262	And the elders of that city shall bring down the heifer unto a rough valley,
c20263	which is neither eared
c20264	nor sown,
c20265	and shall strike off the heifer's neck there in the valley:
c20266	And the priests the sons of Levi shall come near;
c20267	for them the LORD thy God hath chosen
c20268	to minister
c20269	unto him, and to bless in the name of the LORD;
c20270	and by their word shall every controversy and every stroke be <i>tried:</i>
c20271	And all the elders of that city,
c20272	<i>that are</i> next unto the slain
c20273	<i>man,</i> shall wash their hands over the heifer
c20274	that is beheaded in the valley:
c20275	And they shall answer
c20276	and say,
c20277	Our hands have not shed this blood,
c20278	neither have our eyes seen <i>it.</i>
c20279	Be merciful, O LORD, unto thy people Israel,
c20280	whom thou hast redeemed,
c20282	and lay not innocent blood unto thy people of Israel's charge.
c20283	And the blood shall be forgiven them.
c20284	So shalt thou put away the <i>guilt of</i> innocent blood from among
c20285	you, when thou shalt do
c20286	<i>that which is</i> right in the sight of the LORD.
c20287	When thou goest forth to war against thine enemies,
c20288	and the LORD thy God hath delivered them into thine hands,
c20289	and thou hast taken them captive,
c20290	And seest among the captives a beautiful woman,
c20291	and hast a desire
c20292	unto her, that thou wouldest have her to thy wife;
c20293	Then thou shalt bring her home to thine house;
c20294	and she shall shave her head,
c20295	and pare her nails;
c20296	And she shall put the raiment of her captivity from off
c20297	her, and shall remain in thine house,
c20298	and bewail her father and her mother a full month:
c20299	and after that thou shalt go in unto
c20300	her, and be her husband,
c20301	and she shall be thy wife.
c20302	And it shall be,
c20303	if thou have no delight
c20304	in her, then thou shalt let her go whither she will;
c20305	but thou shalt not sell her at all for money,
c20306	thou shalt not make merchandise
c20307	of her, because thou hast humbled her.
c20308	If a man have two wives,
c20309	one beloved,
c20310	and another hated,
c20311	and they have born him children, <i>both</i> the beloved and the hated;
c20312	and <i>if</i> the firstborn son be hers that was hated:
c20313	Then it shall be,
c20314	when
c20315	he maketh his sons to inherit
c20316	<i>that</i> which he hath,
c20317	<i>that</i> he may not
c20318	make the son of the beloved firstborn before the son of the hated, <i>which is indeed</i> the firstborn:
c20319	But he shall acknowledge the son of the hated <i>for</i> the firstborn,
c20320	by giving him a double portion of all
c20321	that he hath:
c20322	for he <i>is</i> the beginning of his strength;
c20323	the right of the firstborn <i>is</i> his.
c20324	If a man have a stubborn and rebellious son,
c20325	which will not obey the voice of his father, or the voice of his mother,
c20326	and <i>that,</i> when they have chastened
c20327	him, will not hearken unto them:
c20328	Then shall his father and his mother lay hold
c20329	on him, and bring him out unto the elders of his city, and unto the gate of his place;
c20330	And they shall say unto the elders of his city,
c20331	This our son <i>is</i> stubborn and rebellious,
c20332	he will not obey our voice;
c20333	<i>he is</i> a glutton, and a drunkard.
c20334	And all the men of his city shall stone him with stones,
c20335	that he die:
c20336	so shalt thou put evil away from among
c20337	you; and all Israel shall hear,
c20338	and fear.
c20339	And if a man have committed a sin worthy of death,
c20340	and he be to be put to death,
c20341	and thou hang him on a tree:
c20342	His body shall not remain all night upon the tree,
c20343	but thou shalt in any wise bury him that day;
c20344	(for he that is hanged <i>is</i> accursed of God;)
c20345	that thy land be not defiled,
c20346	which the LORD thy God giveth thee <i>for</i> an inheritance.
c20347	Thou shalt not see thy brother's ox or his sheep
c20348	go astray,
c20349	and hide thyself from
c20350	them: thou shalt in any case bring them again unto thy brother.
c20351	And if thy brother <i>be</i> not nigh unto
c20352	thee, or if thou know him not,
c20353	then thou shalt bring it unto thine own house,
c20354	and it shall be with
c20355	thee until thy brother seek after
c20356	it, and thou shalt restore it to him again.
c20357	In like manner shalt thou do with his ass;
c20358	and so shalt thou do with his raiment;
c20359	and with all lost thing of thy brother's, which he hath lost,
c20361	and thou hast found, shalt thou do likewise:
c20362	thou mayest not
c20363	hide thyself.
c20364	Thou shalt not see thy brother's ass or his ox
c20365	fall down by the way,
c20366	and hide thyself from
c20367	them: thou shalt surely help him to lift <i>them</i> up again.
c20368	The woman shall not wear that which pertaineth unto a man,
c20369	neither shall a man put on a woman's garment:
c20370	for all that do so <i>are</i> abomination unto the LORD thy God.
c20372	If a bird's nest chance to be before thee in the way in any tree, or on the ground, <i>whether they be</i> young ones, or eggs,
c20373	and the dam sitting upon the young, or upon the eggs,
c20374	thou shalt not take the dam with the young:
c20375	<i>But</i> thou shalt in any wise let the dam go,
c20376	and take the young
c20377	to thee; that it may be well
c20378	with thee, and <i>that</i> thou mayest prolong <i>thy</i> days.
c20379	When thou buildest a new house,
c20380	then thou shalt make a battlement for thy roof,
c20381	that thou bring not blood upon thine house,
c20382	if any man
c20383	fall from thence.
c20384	Thou shalt not sow thy vineyard with divers seeds:
c20385	lest the fruit of thy seed
c20387	which thou hast sown,
c20388	and the fruit of thy vineyard, be defiled.
c20389	Thou shalt not plow with an ox and an ass together.
c20390	Thou shalt not wear a garment of divers sorts, <i>as</i> of woollen and linen together.
c20391	Thou shalt make thee fringes upon the four quarters of thy vesture,
c20392	wherewith thou coverest <i>thyself.</i>
c20393	If any man take a wife,
c20394	and go in unto
c20395	her, and hate her,
c20396	And give occasions of speech
c20397	against her, and bring up an evil name upon
c20398	her, and say,
c20399	I took this woman,
c20400	and when I came to
c20401	her, I found her not a maid:
c20402	Then shall the father of the damsel, and her mother, take
c20403	and bring forth <i>the tokens of</i> the damsel's virginity unto the elders of the city in the gate:
c20404	And the damsel's father shall say unto the elders,
c20405	I gave my daughter unto this man to wife,
c20406	and he hateth her;
c20407	And, lo,
c20408	he hath given occasions of speech
c20409	<i>against her,</i> saying,
c20410	I found not thy daughter a maid;
c20411	and yet these <i>are the tokens of</i> my daughter's virginity.
c20412	And they shall spread the cloth before the elders of the city.
c20413	And the elders of that city shall take that man
c20414	and chastise him;
c20415	And they shall amerce him in an hundred <i>shekels</i> of silver,
c20416	and give <i>them</i> unto the father of the damsel,
c20417	because he hath brought up an evil name upon a virgin of Israel:
c20418	and she shall be his wife;
c20419	he may not
c20420	put her away all his days.
c20421	But if this thing be true,
c20422	<i>and the tokens of</i> virginity be not found for the damsel:
c20423	Then they shall bring out the damsel to the door of her father's house,
c20424	and the men of her city shall stone her with stones
c20425	that she die:
c20426	because she hath wrought folly in Israel,
c20427	to play the whore in her father's house:
c20428	so shalt thou put evil away from among you.
c20429	If a man be found
c20430	lying with a woman married to an husband,
c20431	then they shall both of them die,
c20432	<i>both</i> the man
c20433	that lay with the woman,
c20434	and the woman:
c20435	so shalt thou put away evil from Israel.
c20436	If a damsel <i>that is</i> a virgin be
c20437	betrothed unto an husband,
c20438	and a man find her in the city,
c20439	and lie with her;
c20440	Then ye shall bring them both out unto the gate of that city,
c20441	and ye shall stone them with stones
c20442	that they die;
c20443	the damsel, because
c20444	she cried not, <i>being</i> in the city;
c20445	and the man, because
c20446	he hath humbled his neighbour's wife:
c20447	so thou shalt put away evil from among you.
c20448	But if a man find a betrothed damsel in the field,
c20449	and the man force
c20450	her, and lie with
c20451	her: then the man only
c20452	that lay with her shall die:
c20454	But unto the damsel thou shalt do nothing;
c20455	<i>there is</i> in the damsel no sin <i>worthy</i> of death:
c20456	for
c20457	as when a man riseth against his neighbour,
c20458	and slayeth
c20459	him, even so <i>is</i> this matter:
c20460	For he found her in the field,
c20461	<i>and</i> the betrothed damsel cried,
c20462	and <i>there was</i> none to save her.
c20463	If a man find a damsel <i>that is</i> a virgin,
c20464	which is not betrothed,
c20465	and lay hold
c20466	on her, and lie with
c20467	her, and they be found;
c20468	Then the man that lay with her shall give
c20470	unto the damsel's father fifty <i>shekels</i> of silver,
c20471	and she shall be his wife;
c20472	because he hath humbled
c20473	her, he may not
c20474	put her away all his days.
c20475	A man shall not take his father's wife,
c20476	nor discover his father's skirt.
c20477	He that is wounded in the stones, or hath his privy member cut off, shall not enter into the congregation of the LORD.
c20478	A bastard shall not enter into the congregation of the LORD;
c20479	even to his tenth generation shall he not enter into the congregation of the LORD.
c20480	An Ammonite or Moabite shall not enter into the congregation of the LORD;
c20481	even to their tenth generation shall they not enter into the congregation of the LORD for ever:
c20482	Because they met you not with bread and with water in the way,
c20483	when ye came forth out of Egypt;
c20484	and because they hired against thee Balaam the son of Beor of Pethor of Mesopotamia,
c20485	to curse thee.
c20486	Nevertheless the LORD thy God would not
c20487	hearken unto Balaam;
c20488	but the LORD thy God turned the curse into a blessing
c20489	unto thee, because the LORD thy God loved thee.
c20490	Thou shalt not seek their peace nor their prosperity all thy days for ever.
c20491	Thou shalt not abhor an Edomite;
c20492	for he <i>is</i> thy brother:
c20493	thou shalt not abhor an Egyptian;
c20494	because thou wast a stranger in his land.
c20495	The children
c20496	that are begotten
c20497	of them shall enter into the congregation of the LORD in their third generation.
c20498	When the host goeth forth against thine enemies,
c20499	then keep thee from every wicked thing.
c20500	If there be among you any man,
c20501	that is not clean by reason of uncleanness that chanceth him by night,
c20502	then shall he go abroad out of the camp,
c20503	he shall not come within the camp:
c20504	But it shall be,
c20505	when evening cometh on,
c20506	he shall wash <i>himself</i> with water:
c20508	and when the sun is down,
c20509	he shall come into the camp <i>again.</i>
c20510	Thou shalt have a place also without the camp,
c20511	whither thou shalt go forth abroad:
c20512	And thou shalt have a paddle upon thy weapon;
c20513	and it shall be,
c20514	when thou wilt ease thyself abroad,
c20515	thou shalt dig
c20516	therewith, and shalt turn back
c20517	and cover that which cometh from thee:
c20518	For the LORD thy God walketh in the midst of thy camp,
c20519	to deliver
c20520	thee, and to give up thine enemies before
c20521	thee; therefore shall thy camp be holy:
c20522	that he see no unclean thing
c20523	in thee, and turn away from thee.
c20524	Thou shalt not deliver unto his master the servant
c20525	which is escaped from his master unto thee:
c20526	He shall dwell with thee, <i>even</i> among you, in that place
c20527	which he shall choose in one of thy gates,
c20528	where it liketh him best:
c20529	thou shalt not oppress him.
c20530	There shall be no whore of the daughters of Israel,
c20531	nor a sodomite of the sons of Israel.
c20532	Thou shalt not bring the hire of a whore, or the price of a dog, into the house of the LORD thy God for any vow:
c20533	for even both these <i>are</i> abomination unto the LORD thy God.
c20534	Thou shalt not lend upon usury to thy brother; usury of money, usury of victuals, usury of any thing
c20535	that is lent upon usury:
c20536	Unto a stranger thou mayest lend upon usury;
c20537	but unto thy brother thou shalt not lend upon usury:
c20538	that the LORD thy God may bless thee in all that thou settest thine hand to in the land
c20539	whither thou goest
c20540	to possess it.
c20541	When thou shalt vow a vow unto the LORD thy God,
c20542	thou shalt not slack
c20543	to pay
c20544	it: for the LORD thy God will surely require it of
c20545	thee; and it would be sin in thee.
c20546	But if thou shalt forbear
c20547	to vow,
c20548	it shall be no sin in thee.
c20549	That which is gone out of thy lips thou shalt keep
c20550	and perform;
c20551	<i>even</i> a freewill offering, according as thou hast vowed unto the LORD thy God,
c20552	which thou hast promised with thy mouth.
c20553	When thou comest into thy neighbour's vineyard,
c20554	then thou mayest eat grapes thy fill at thine own pleasure;
c20555	but thou shalt not put <i>any</i> in thy vessel.
c20556	When thou comest into the standing corn of thy neighbour,
c20557	then thou mayest pluck the ears with thine hand;
c20558	but thou shalt not move a sickle unto thy neighbour's standing corn.
c20559	When a man hath taken a wife,
c20560	and married
c20561	her, and it come to pass
c20562	that she find no favour in his eyes,
c20563	because he hath found some uncleanness
c20564	in her: then let him write her a bill of divorcement,
c20565	and give <i>it</i> in her hand,
c20566	and send her out of his house.
c20567	And when she is departed out of his house,
c20568	she may go
c20569	and be another man's <i>wife.</i>
c20570	And <i>if</i> the latter husband hate
c20571	her, and write her a bill of divorcement,
c20572	and giveth <i>it</i> in her hand,
c20573	and sendeth her out of his house;
c20574	or if the latter husband die,
c20575	which took her <i>to be</i> his wife;
c20576	Her former husband, which sent her away, may not
c20578	her again
c20579	take
c20580	to be his wife,
c20581	after that she is defiled;
c20582	for that <i>is</i> abomination before the LORD:
c20583	and thou shalt not cause the land to sin,
c20584	which the LORD thy God giveth thee <i>for</i> an inheritance.
c20585	When a man hath taken a new wife,
c20586	he shall not go out to war,
c20587	neither shall he be charged with any business:
c20588	<i>but</i> he shall be free at home one year,
c20589	and shall cheer up his wife
c20590	which he hath taken.
c20591	No man shall take the nether or the upper millstone to pledge: for he taketh <i>a man's</i> life to pledge.
c20593	If a man be found
c20594	stealing any of his brethren of the children of Israel,
c20595	and maketh merchandise
c20596	of him, or selleth
c20597	him; then that thief shall die;
c20598	and thou shalt put evil away from among you.
c20599	Take heed in the plague of leprosy,
c20600	that thou observe diligently,
c20601	and do according to all
c20602	that the priests the Levites shall teach
c20603	you: as I commanded
c20604	them, <i>so</i> ye shall observe
c20605	to do.
c20606	Remember
c20607	what the LORD thy God did unto Miriam by the way,
c20608	after that ye were come forth out of Egypt.
c20609	When thou dost lend thy brother any thing,
c20610	thou shalt not go into his house
c20611	to fetch his pledge.
c20612	Thou shalt stand abroad,
c20613	and the man
c20614	to whom thou dost lend
c20615	shall bring out the pledge abroad unto thee.
c20616	And if the man <i>be</i> poor,
c20617	thou shalt not sleep with his pledge:
c20618	In any case thou shalt deliver him the pledge
c20619	again when the sun goeth down,
c20620	that he may sleep in his own raiment,
c20621	and bless
c20622	thee: and it shall be righteousness unto thee before the LORD thy God.
c20623	Thou shalt not oppress an hired servant <i>that is</i> poor and needy, <i>whether he be</i> of thy brethren, or of thy strangers
c20624	that <i>are</i> in thy land within thy gates:
c20625	At his day thou shalt give <i>him</i> his hire,
c20626	neither shall the sun go down upon
c20627	it; for he <i>is</i> poor,
c20628	and setteth his heart upon it: lest he cry against
c20629	thee unto the LORD,
c20630	and it be sin unto thee.
c20631	The fathers shall not be put to death for the children,
c20632	neither shall the children be put to death for the fathers:
c20633	every man shall be put to death for his own sin.
c20635	Thou shalt not pervert the judgment of the stranger, <i>nor</i> of the fatherless;
c20636	nor take a widow's raiment to pledge:
c20637	But thou shalt remember
c20638	that thou wast a bondman in Egypt,
c20639	and the LORD thy God redeemed thee thence:
c20640	therefore I command
c20641	thee to do this thing.
c20642	When thou cuttest down thine harvest in thy field,
c20643	and hast forgot a sheaf in the field,
c20644	thou shalt not go again
c20645	to fetch
c20646	it: it shall be for the stranger, for the fatherless, and for the widow:
c20647	that the LORD thy God may bless thee in all the work of thine hands.
c20648	When thou beatest thine olive tree,
c20649	thou shalt not go over the boughs again:
c20650	it shall be for the stranger, for the fatherless, and for the widow.
c20651	When thou gatherest the grapes of thy vineyard,
c20652	thou shalt not glean <i>it</i> afterward:
c20653	it shall be for the stranger, for the fatherless, and for the widow.
c20654	And thou shalt remember
c20655	that thou wast a bondman in the land of Egypt:
c20656	therefore I command
c20657	thee to do this thing.
c20658	If there be a controversy between men,
c20659	and they come unto judgment,
c20660	that <i>the judges</i> may judge
c20661	them; then they shall justify the righteous,
c20662	and condemn the wicked.
c20663	And it shall be,
c20664	if the wicked man <i>be</i> worthy to be beaten,
c20665	that the judge shall cause him to lie down,
c20666	and to be beaten before his face, according to his fault, by a certain number.
c20667	Forty stripes he may give
c20668	him, <i>and</i> not exceed:
c20669	lest, <i>if</i> he should exceed,
c20670	and beat
c20671	him above these with many stripes,
c20672	then thy brother should seem vile unto thee.
c20673	Thou shalt not muzzle the ox
c20674	when he treadeth out <i>the corn.</i>
c20675	If brethren dwell together,
c20676	and one of them die,
c20677	and have no child,
c20678	the wife of the dead shall not marry without unto a stranger:
c20679	her husband's brother shall go in unto
c20680	her, and take her to him to wife,
c20681	and perform the duty of an husband's brother unto her.
c20682	And it shall be,
c20683	<i>that</i> the firstborn
c20684	which she beareth
c20685	shall succeed in the name of his brother <i>which is</i> dead,
c20686	that his name be not put out of Israel.
c20687	And if the man like not
c20688	to take his brother's wife,
c20689	then let his brother's wife go up to the gate unto the elders,
c20690	and say,
c20691	My husband's brother refuseth
c20692	to raise up unto his brother a name in Israel,
c20693	he will not
c20694	perform the duty of my husband's brother.
c20695	Then the elders of his city shall call
c20696	him, and speak unto
c20697	him: and <i>if</i> he stand
c20698	<i>to it,</i> and say,
c20699	I like not
c20700	to take her;
c20701	Then shall his brother's wife come unto him in the presence of the elders,
c20702	and loose his shoe from off his foot,
c20703	and spit in his face,
c20704	and shall answer
c20705	and say,
c20706	So shall it be done unto that man
c20707	that will not build up his brother's house.
c20708	And his name shall be called in Israel,
c20709	The house of him that hath his shoe loosed.
c20710	When men strive together one with another,
c20711	and the wife of the one draweth near
c20712	for to deliver her husband out of the hand of him that smiteth
c20713	him, and putteth forth her hand,
c20714	and taketh him by the secrets:
c20715	Then thou shalt cut off her hand,
c20716	thine eye shall not pity <i>her.</i>
c20717	Thou shalt not have in thy bag divers weights, a great and a small.
c20718	Thou shalt not have in thine house divers measures, a great and a small.
c20719	<i>But</i> thou shalt have a perfect and just weight,
c20720	a perfect and just measure shalt thou have:
c20721	that thy days may be lengthened in the land
c20722	which the LORD thy God giveth thee.
c20723	For all that do such things, <i>and</i> all that do unrighteously, <i>are</i> an abomination unto the LORD thy God.
c20724	Remember
c20725	what Amalek did unto thee by the way,
c20726	when ye were come forth out of Egypt;
c20727	How he met thee by the way,
c20728	and smote the hindmost of thee, <i>even</i> all
c20729	<i>that were</i> feeble behind
c20730	thee, when thou <i>wast</i> faint and weary;
c20731	and he feared not God.
c20732	Therefore it shall be,
c20733	when the LORD thy God hath given thee rest from all thine enemies round about, in the land
c20734	which the LORD thy God giveth thee <i>for</i> an inheritance
c20735	to possess
c20736	it, <i>that</i> thou shalt blot out the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven;
c20737	thou shalt not forget <i>it.</i>
c20738	And it shall be,
c20739	when thou <i>art</i> come in unto the land
c20740	which the LORD thy God giveth thee <i>for</i> an inheritance,
c20741	and possessest
c20742	it, and dwellest therein;
c20743	That thou shalt take of the first of all the fruit of the earth,
c20744	which thou shalt bring of thy land
c20745	that the LORD thy God giveth
c20746	thee, and shalt put <i>it</i> in a basket,
c20747	and shalt go unto the place
c20748	which the LORD thy God shall choose
c20749	to place his name there.
c20750	And thou shalt go unto the priest
c20751	that shall be in those days,
c20752	and say unto
c20753	him, I profess this day unto the LORD thy God,
c20754	that I am come unto the country
c20755	which the LORD sware unto our fathers
c20756	for to give us.
c20757	And the priest shall take the basket out of thine hand,
c20758	and set it down before the altar of the LORD thy God.
c20759	And thou shalt speak
c20760	and say before the LORD thy God,
c20761	A Syrian ready to perish <i>was</i> my father,
c20762	and he went down into Egypt,
c20763	and sojourned there with a few,
c20764	and became there a nation, great, mighty, and populous:
c20765	And the Egyptians evil entreated
c20766	us, and afflicted
c20767	us, and laid upon us hard bondage:
c20768	And when we cried unto the LORD God of our fathers,
c20769	the LORD heard our voice,
c20770	and looked on our affliction, and our labour, and our oppression:
c20771	And the LORD brought us forth out of Egypt with a mighty hand, and with an outstretched arm, and with great terribleness, and with signs, and with wonders:
c20772	And he hath brought us into this place,
c20773	and hath given us this land, <i>even</i> a land that floweth with milk and honey.
c20774	And now,
c20775	behold, I have brought the firstfruits of the land,
c20776	which thou, O LORD, hast given
c20778	me. And thou shalt set it before the LORD thy God,
c20779	and worship before the LORD thy God:
c20780	And thou shalt rejoice in every good
c20781	<i>thing</i> which the LORD thy God hath given unto thee, and unto thine house,
c20782	thou, and the Levite, and the stranger
c20783	that <i>is</i> among you.
c20784	When thou hast made an end
c20785	of tithing all the tithes of thine increase the third year, <i>which is</i> the year of tithing,
c20786	and hast given <i>it</i> unto the Levite, the stranger, the fatherless, and the widow,
c20787	that they may eat within thy gates,
c20788	and be filled;
c20789	Then thou shalt say before the LORD thy God,
c20790	I have brought away the hallowed things out of <i>mine</i> house,
c20791	and also have given them unto the Levite, and unto the stranger, to the fatherless, and to the widow, according to all thy commandments
c20792	which thou hast commanded
c20793	me: I have not transgressed thy commandments,
c20794	neither have I forgotten <i>them:</i>
c20795	I have not eaten thereof in my mourning,
c20796	neither have I taken away <i>ought</i> thereof for <i>any</i> unclean
c20797	<i>use,</i> nor given <i>ought</i> thereof for the dead:
c20798	<i>but</i> I have hearkened to the voice of the LORD my God,
c20799	<i>and</i> have done according to all
c20800	that thou hast commanded me.
c20801	Look down from thy holy habitation, from heaven,
c20802	and bless thy people Israel, and the land
c20803	which thou hast given
c20804	us, as thou swarest unto our fathers,
c20805	a land that floweth with milk and honey.
c20806	This day the LORD thy God hath commanded
c20807	thee to do these statutes and judgments:
c20808	thou shalt therefore keep
c20809	and do them with all thine heart, and with all thy soul.
c20810	Thou hast avouched the LORD this day
c20811	to be thy God,
c20812	and to walk in his ways,
c20813	and to keep his statutes, and his commandments, and his judgments,
c20814	and to hearken unto his voice:
c20815	And the LORD hath avouched thee this day
c20816	to be his peculiar people,
c20817	as he hath promised
c20818	thee, and that <i>thou</i> shouldest keep all his commandments;
c20819	And to make thee high above all nations
c20820	which he hath made,
c20821	in praise, and in name, and in honour;
c20822	and that thou mayest be an holy people unto the LORD thy God,
c20823	as he hath spoken.
c20824	And Moses with the elders of Israel commanded the people,
c20825	saying,
c20826	Keep all the commandments
c20827	which I command you this day.
c20828	And it shall be on the day
c20829	when ye shall pass over Jordan unto the land
c20830	which the LORD thy God giveth
c20831	thee, that thou shalt set thee up great stones,
c20832	and plaister them with plaister:
c20833	And thou shalt write upon them all the words of this law,
c20834	when thou art passed over,
c20835	that thou mayest go in unto the land
c20836	which the LORD thy God giveth
c20837	thee, a land that floweth with milk and honey;
c20838	as the LORD God of thy fathers hath promised thee.
c20839	Therefore it shall be
c20840	when ye be gone over Jordan,
c20841	<i>that</i> ye shall set up these stones,
c20842	which I command you this day,
c20843	in mount Ebal,
c20844	and thou shalt plaister them with plaister.
c20845	And there shalt thou build an altar unto the LORD thy God,
c20846	an altar of stones:
c20847	thou shalt not lift up <i>any</i> iron <i>tool</i> upon them.
c20848	Thou shalt build the altar of the LORD thy God of whole stones:
c20849	and thou shalt offer burnt offerings thereon unto the LORD thy God:
c20850	And thou shalt offer peace offerings,
c20851	and shalt eat there,
c20852	and rejoice before the LORD thy God.
c20853	And thou shalt write upon the stones all the words of this law
c20854	very plainly.
c20855	And Moses and the priests the Levites spake unto all Israel,
c20856	saying,
c20857	Take heed,
c20858	and hearken,
c20859	O Israel;
c20860	this day thou art become the people of the LORD thy God.
c20861	Thou shalt therefore obey the voice of the LORD thy God,
c20862	and do his commandments and his statutes,
c20863	which I command thee this day.
c20864	And Moses charged the people the same day,
c20865	saying,
c20866	These shall stand
c20867	to bless the people,
c20868	upon mount Gerizim
c20869	when ye are come over Jordan;
c20870	Simeon, and Levi, and Judah, and Issachar, and Joseph, and Benjamin:
c20871	And these shall stand upon mount Ebal to curse;
c20872	Reuben, Gad, and Asher, and Zebulun, Dan, and Naphtali.
c20873	And the Levites shall speak,
c20874	and say unto all the men of Israel with a loud voice,
c20875	Cursed <i>be</i> the man
c20876	that maketh <i>any</i> graven or molten image, an abomination unto the LORD, the work of the hands of the craftsman,
c20877	and putteth <i>it</i> in <i>a</i> secret
c20878	<i>place.</i> And all the people shall answer
c20879	and say,
c20880	Amen.
c20881	Cursed
c20882	<i>be</i> he that setteth light by his father or his mother.
c20883	And all the people shall say,
c20884	Amen.
c20885	Cursed
c20886	<i>be</i> he that removeth his neighbour's landmark.
c20887	And all the people shall say,
c20888	Amen.
c20889	Cursed
c20890	<i>be</i> he that maketh the blind to wander out of the way.
c20891	And all the people shall say,
c20892	Amen.
c20893	Cursed
c20894	<i>be</i> he that perverteth the judgment of the stranger, fatherless, and widow.
c20895	And all the people shall say,
c20896	Amen.
c20897	Cursed
c20898	<i>be</i> he that lieth with his father's wife;
c20899	because he uncovereth his father's skirt.
c20900	And all the people shall say,
c20901	Amen.
c20902	Cursed
c20903	<i>be</i> he that lieth with any manner of beast.
c20904	And all the people shall say,
c20905	Amen.
c20906	Cursed
c20907	<i>be</i> he that lieth with his sister, the daughter of his father, or the daughter of his mother.
c20908	And all the people shall say,
c20909	Amen.
c20910	Cursed
c20911	<i>be</i> he that lieth with his mother in law.
c20912	And all the people shall say,
c20913	Amen.
c20914	Cursed
c20915	<i>be</i> he that smiteth his neighbour secretly.
c20916	And all the people shall say,
c20917	Amen.
c20918	Cursed
c20919	<i>be</i> he that taketh reward
c20920	to slay an innocent person.
c20921	And all the people shall say,
c20922	Amen.
c20923	Cursed
c20924	<i>be</i> he that confirmeth not <i>all</i> the words of this law
c20925	to do
c20926	them. And all the people shall say,
c20927	Amen.
c20928	And it shall come to pass,
c20929	if thou shalt hearken diligently unto the voice of the LORD thy God,
c20930	to observe
c20931	<i>and</i> to do all his commandments
c20932	which I command thee this day,
c20933	that the LORD thy God will set thee on high above all nations of the earth:
c20934	And all these blessings shall come on
c20935	thee, and overtake
c20936	thee, if thou shalt hearken unto the voice of the LORD thy God.
c20937	Blessed <i>shalt</i> thou <i>be</i> in the city,
c20938	and blessed <i>shalt</i> thou <i>be</i> in the field.
c20939	Blessed <i>shall be</i> the fruit of thy body, and the fruit of thy ground, and the fruit of thy cattle, the increase of thy kine, and the flocks of thy sheep.
c20940	Blessed <i>shall be</i> thy basket and thy store.
c20941	Blessed <i>shalt</i> thou
c20942	<i>be</i> when thou comest in,
c20943	and blessed <i>shalt</i> thou
c20944	<i>be</i> when thou goest out.
c20945	The LORD shall cause thine enemies
c20946	that rise up against
c20947	thee to be smitten before thy face:
c20948	they shall come out against thee one way,
c20949	and flee before thee seven ways.
c20950	The LORD shall command the blessing upon thee in thy storehouses, and in all that thou settest thine hand
c20951	unto; and he shall bless thee in the land
c20952	which the LORD thy God giveth thee.
c20953	The LORD shall establish thee an holy people
c20954	unto himself, as he hath sworn
c20955	unto thee, if thou shalt keep the commandments of the LORD thy God,
c20956	and walk in his ways.
c20957	And all people of the earth shall see
c20958	that thou art called by the name of the LORD;
c20959	and they shall be afraid of thee.
c20960	And the LORD shall make thee plenteous in goods, in the fruit of thy body, and in the fruit of thy cattle, and in the fruit of thy ground, in the land
c20961	which the LORD sware unto thy fathers
c20962	to give thee.
c20963	The LORD shall open unto thee his good treasure, the heaven
c20964	to give the rain unto thy land in his season,
c20965	and to bless all the work of thine hand:
c20966	and thou shalt lend unto many nations,
c20967	and thou shalt not borrow.
c20968	And the LORD shall make thee the head,
c20969	and not the tail;
c20970	and thou shalt be above only,
c20971	and thou shalt not be beneath;
c20972	if that thou hearken unto the commandments of the LORD thy God,
c20973	which I command thee this day,
c20974	to observe
c20975	and to do <i>them:</i>
c20976	And thou shalt not go aside from any of the words
c20977	which I command thee this day,
c20978	<i>to</i> the right hand, or <i>to</i> the left,
c20979	to go after other gods
c20980	to serve them.
c20981	But it shall come to pass,
c20982	if thou wilt not hearken unto the voice of the LORD thy God,
c20983	to observe
c20984	to do all his commandments and his statutes
c20985	which I command thee this day;
c20986	that all these curses shall come upon
c20987	thee, and overtake thee:
c20988	Cursed <i>shalt</i> thou <i>be</i> in the city,
c20989	and cursed <i>shalt</i> thou <i>be</i> in the field.
c20990	Cursed <i>shall be</i> thy basket and thy store.
c20991	Cursed <i>shall be</i> the fruit of thy body, and the fruit of thy land, the increase of thy kine, and the flocks of thy sheep.
c20992	Cursed <i>shalt</i> thou
c20993	<i>be</i> when thou comest in,
c20994	and cursed <i>shalt</i> thou
c20995	<i>be</i> when thou goest out.
c20996	The LORD shall send upon thee cursing, vexation, and rebuke, in all that thou settest thine hand
c20997	unto for to do,
c20998	until thou be destroyed,
c20999	and until thou perish quickly; because of the wickedness of thy doings,
c21000	whereby thou hast forsaken me.
c21001	The LORD shall make the pestilence cleave
c21002	unto thee, until he have consumed thee from off the land,
c21003	whither thou goest
c21004	to possess it.
c21005	The LORD shall smite thee with a consumption, and with a fever, and with an inflammation, and with an extreme burning, and with the sword, and with blasting, and with mildew;
c21006	and they shall pursue
c21007	thee until thou perish.
c21008	And thy heaven that <i>is</i> over thy head shall be
c21010	brass,
c21011	and the earth
c21012	that is under
c21013	thee <i>shall be</i> iron.
c21014	The LORD shall make the rain of thy land powder and dust:
c21015	from heaven shall it come down upon
c21016	thee, until thou be destroyed.
c21017	The LORD shall cause
c21018	thee to be smitten before thine enemies:
c21019	thou shalt go out one way against
c21020	them, and flee seven ways before
c21021	them: and shalt be removed into all the kingdoms of the earth.
c21022	And thy carcase shall be meat unto all fowls of the air, and unto the beasts of the earth,
c21023	and no man shall fray <i>them</i> away.
c21024	The LORD will smite thee with the botch of Egypt, and with the emerods, and with the scab, and with the itch,
c21025	whereof thou canst not
c21026	be healed.
c21027	The LORD shall smite thee with madness, and blindness, and astonishment of heart:
c21028	And thou shalt grope at noonday,
c21029	as the blind gropeth in darkness,
c21030	and thou shalt not prosper in thy ways:
c21031	and thou shalt be only oppressed and spoiled evermore,
c21032	and no man shall save <i>thee.</i>
c21033	Thou shalt betroth a wife,
c21034	and another man shall lie with
c21035	her: thou shalt build an house,
c21036	and thou shalt not dwell
c21037	therein: thou shalt plant a vineyard,
c21038	and shalt not gather the grapes thereof.
c21039	Thine ox <i>shall be</i> slain before thine eyes,
c21040	and thou shalt not eat thereof:
c21041	thine ass <i>shall be</i> violently taken away from before thy face,
c21042	and shall not be restored
c21043	to thee: thy sheep <i>shall be</i> given unto thine enemies,
c21044	and thou shalt have none to rescue <i>them.</i>
c21045	Thy sons and thy daughters <i>shall be</i> given unto another people,
c21046	and thine eyes shall look,
c21047	and fail <i>with longing</i> for them all the day
c21048	long: and <i>there shall be</i> no might in thine hand.
c21049	The fruit of thy land, and all thy labours, shall a nation which thou knowest not eat up;
c21051	and thou shalt be only oppressed and crushed alway:
c21052	So that thou shalt be mad for the sight of thine eyes
c21053	which thou shalt see.
c21054	The LORD shall smite thee in the knees, and in the legs, with a sore botch
c21055	that cannot
c21056	be healed,
c21057	from the sole of thy foot unto the top of thy head.
c21058	The LORD shall bring thee, and thy king
c21059	which thou shalt set over
c21060	thee, unto a nation
c21061	which neither thou nor thy fathers have known;
c21062	and there shalt thou serve other gods, wood and stone.
c21063	And thou shalt become an astonishment, a proverb, and a byword, among all nations
c21064	whither the LORD shall lead thee.
c21065	Thou shalt carry much seed out into the field,
c21066	and shalt gather <i>but</i> little in;
c21067	for the locust shall consume it.
c21068	Thou shalt plant vineyards,
c21069	and dress
c21070	<i>them,</i> but shalt neither drink <i>of</i> the wine,
c21071	nor gather
c21072	<i>the grapes;</i> for the worms shall eat them.
c21073	Thou shalt have olive trees throughout all thy coasts,
c21074	but thou shalt not anoint <i>thyself</i> with the oil;
c21075	for thine olive shall cast <i>his fruit.</i>
c21076	Thou shalt beget sons and daughters,
c21077	but thou shalt not enjoy
c21078	them; for they shall go into captivity.
c21079	All thy trees and fruit of thy land shall the locust consume.
c21080	The stranger
c21081	that <i>is</i> within
c21082	thee shall get up above thee very high;
c21083	and thou shalt come down very low.
c21084	He shall lend
c21085	to thee, and thou shalt not lend
c21086	to him: he shall be the head,
c21087	and thou shalt be the tail.
c21088	Moreover all these curses shall come upon
c21089	thee, and shall pursue
c21090	thee, and overtake
c21091	thee, till thou be destroyed;
c21092	because thou hearkenedst not unto the voice of the LORD thy God,
c21093	to keep his commandments and his statutes
c21094	which he commanded thee:
c21095	And they shall be upon thee for a sign and for a wonder,
c21096	and upon thy seed for ever.
c21097	Because thou servedst not the LORD thy God with joyfulness, and with gladness of heart, for the abundance of all <i>things;</i>
c21098	Therefore shalt thou serve thine enemies
c21099	which the LORD shall send
c21100	against thee, in hunger, and in thirst, and in nakedness, and in want of all
c21101	<i>things:</i> and he shall put a yoke of iron upon thy neck,
c21102	until he have destroyed thee.
c21103	The LORD shall bring a nation against thee from far, from the end of the earth,
c21104	<i>as swift</i> as the eagle flieth;
c21105	a nation
c21106	whose tongue thou shalt not understand;
c21107	A nation of fierce countenance,
c21108	which shall not regard the person of the old,
c21109	nor shew favour to the young:
c21110	And he shall eat the fruit of thy cattle, and the fruit of thy land,
c21111	until thou be destroyed:
c21112	which <i>also</i> shall not leave thee <i>either</i> corn, wine, or oil, <i>or</i> the increase of thy kine, or flocks of thy sheep,
c21113	until he have destroyed thee.
c21114	And he shall besiege thee in all thy gates,
c21115	until thy high and fenced walls come down,
c21116	wherein thou trustedst,
c21117	throughout all thy land:
c21118	and he shall besiege thee in all thy gates throughout all thy land,
c21119	which the LORD thy God hath given thee.
c21120	And thou shalt eat the fruit of thine own body, the flesh of thy sons and of thy daughters,
c21121	which the LORD thy God hath given
c21122	thee, in the siege, and in the straitness,
c21123	wherewith thine enemies shall distress thee:
c21124	<i>So that</i> the man
c21125	<i>that is</i> tender
c21126	among you, and very delicate,
c21127	his eye shall be evil toward his brother, and toward the wife of his bosom, and toward the remnant of his children
c21128	which he shall leave:
c21129	So that he will not give to any of them of the flesh of his children
c21130	whom he shall eat:
c21131	because he hath nothing left him in the siege, and in the straitness,
c21132	wherewith thine enemies shall distress thee in all thy gates.
c21133	The tender and delicate woman
c21134	among you, which would not adventure to set the sole of her foot
c21135	upon the ground
c21136	for delicateness
c21137	and tenderness,
c21138	her eye shall be evil toward the husband of her bosom, and toward her son, and toward her daughter,
c21139	And toward her young one
c21140	that cometh out from between her feet,
c21141	and toward her children
c21142	which she shall bear:
c21143	for she shall eat them for want of all <i>things</i> secretly in the siege and straitness,
c21144	wherewith thine enemy shall distress thee in thy gates.
c21145	If thou wilt not observe
c21146	to do all the words of this law
c21147	that are written in this book,
c21148	that thou mayest fear this glorious and fearful name, THE LORD THY GOD;
c21149	Then the LORD will make thy plagues wonderful, and the plagues of thy seed, <i>even</i> great plagues, and of long continuance, and sore sicknesses, and of long continuance.
c21150	Moreover he will bring upon thee all the diseases of Egypt,
c21151	which thou wast afraid of;
c21152	and they shall cleave unto thee.
c21153	Also every sickness, and every plague,
c21154	which <i>is</i> not written in the book of this law,
c21155	them will the LORD bring upon
c21156	thee, until thou be destroyed.
c21157	And ye shall be left few in number,
c21158	whereas ye were as the stars of heaven for multitude;
c21159	because thou wouldest not obey the voice of the LORD thy God.
c21160	And it shall come to pass,
c21161	<i>that</i> as the LORD rejoiced over
c21162	you to do you good,
c21163	and to multiply
c21164	you; so the LORD will rejoice over
c21165	you to destroy
c21166	you, and to bring you to nought;
c21167	and ye shall be plucked from off the land
c21168	whither thou goest
c21169	to possess it.
c21170	And the LORD shall scatter thee among all people, from the one end of the earth even unto the other;
c21171	and there thou shalt serve other gods,
c21172	which neither thou nor thy fathers have known,
c21173	<i>even</i> wood and stone.
c21174	And among these nations shalt thou find no ease,
c21175	neither shall the sole of thy foot have rest:
c21176	but the LORD shall give thee there a trembling heart, and failing of eyes, and sorrow of mind:
c21177	And thy life shall hang in doubt before
c21178	thee; and thou shalt fear day and night,
c21179	and shalt have none assurance of thy life:
c21180	In the morning thou shalt say,
c21181	Would God it were even!
c21182	and at even thou shalt say,
c21183	Would God it were morning!
c21184	for the fear of thine heart
c21185	wherewith thou shalt fear,
c21186	and for the sight of thine eyes
c21187	which thou shalt see.
c21188	And the LORD shall bring thee into Egypt again with ships, by the way
c21189	whereof I spake
c21190	it no more again:
c21191	unto thee, Thou shalt see
c21192	and there ye shall be sold unto your enemies for bondmen and bondwomen,
c21193	and no man shall buy <i>you.</i>
c21194	These <i>are</i> the words of the covenant,
c21195	which the LORD commanded Moses
c21196	to make with the children of Israel in the land of Moab,
c21197	beside the covenant
c21198	which he made with them in Horeb.
c21199	And Moses called unto all Israel,
c21200	and said unto
c21201	them, Ye have seen all
c21202	that the LORD did before your eyes in the land of Egypt unto Pharaoh, and unto all his servants, and unto all his land;
c21203	The great temptations
c21204	which thine eyes have seen,
c21205	the signs, and those great miracles:
c21206	Yet the LORD hath not given you an heart
c21207	to perceive,
c21208	and eyes
c21209	to see,
c21210	and ears
c21211	to hear,
c21212	unto this day.
c21213	And I have led you forty years in the wilderness:
c21214	your clothes are not waxen old upon
c21215	you, and thy shoe is not waxen old upon thy foot.
c21216	Ye have not eaten bread,
c21217	neither have ye drunk wine or strong drink:
c21218	that ye might know
c21219	that I <i>am</i> the LORD your God.
c21220	And when ye came unto this place,
c21221	Sihon the king of Heshbon, and Og the king of Bashan, came out
c21222	against
c21223	us unto battle,
c21224	and we smote them:
c21225	And we took their land,
c21226	and gave it for an inheritance unto the Reubenites, and to the Gadites, and to the half tribe of Manasseh.
c21227	Keep therefore the words of this covenant,
c21228	and do
c21229	them, that ye may prosper in all
c21230	that ye do.
c21231	Ye stand this day all of you before the LORD your God; your captains of your tribes, your elders, and your officers, <i>with</i> all the men of Israel,
c21232	Your little ones, your wives, and thy stranger
c21233	that <i>is</i> in thy camp,
c21234	from the hewer of thy wood unto the drawer of thy water:
c21235	That thou shouldest enter into covenant with the LORD thy God, and into his oath,
c21236	which the LORD thy God maketh with thee this day:
c21237	That he may establish thee to day for a people
c21238	unto himself, and <i>that</i> he may be unto thee a God,
c21239	as he hath said
c21240	unto thee, and as he hath sworn unto thy fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.
c21241	Neither with you only do I make this covenant and this oath;
c21242	But
c21243	with <i>him</i> that standeth here with
c21244	us this day before the LORD our God,
c21245	and also with <i>him</i> that <i>is</i> not here with us this day:
c21246	(For ye know
c21247	how we have dwelt in the land of Egypt;
c21248	and how we came through the nations
c21249	which ye passed by;
c21250	And ye have seen their abominations, and their idols, wood and stone, silver and gold,
c21251	which <i>were</i> among them:)
c21252	Lest there should be among you man, or woman, or family, or tribe,
c21253	whose heart turneth away this day from the LORD our God,
c21254	to go
c21255	<i>and</i> serve the gods of these nations;
c21256	lest there should be among you a root
c21257	that beareth gall and wormwood;
c21258	And it come to pass,
c21259	when he heareth the words of this curse,
c21260	that he bless himself in his heart,
c21261	saying,
c21262	I shall have peace,
c21263	though I walk in the imagination of mine heart,
c21264	to add drunkenness to thirst:
c21265	The LORD will not
c21266	spare
c21267	him, but then the anger of the LORD and his jealousy shall smoke against that man,
c21268	and all the curses that are written in this book shall lie
c21270	upon him, and the LORD shall blot out his name from under heaven.
c21271	And the LORD shall separate him unto evil out of all the tribes of Israel, according to all the curses of the covenant
c21272	that are written in this book of the law:
c21273	So that the generation to come of your children that shall rise up after
c21275	you, and the stranger
c21276	that shall come from a far land, shall say,
c21277	when they see the plagues of that land, and the sicknesses
c21278	which the LORD hath laid upon it;
c21280	<i>And that</i> the whole land thereof <i>is</i> brimstone, and salt, <i>and</i> burning,
c21281	<i>that</i> it is not sown,
c21282	nor beareth,
c21283	nor any grass groweth
c21284	therein, like the overthrow of Sodom, and Gomorrah, Admah, and Zeboim,
c21285	which the LORD overthrew in his anger, and in his wrath:
c21286	Even all nations shall say,
c21287	Wherefore hath the LORD done thus unto this land?
c21288	what <i>meaneth</i> the heat of this great anger?
c21289	Then men shall say,
c21290	Because they have forsaken the covenant of the LORD God of their fathers,
c21291	which he made with
c21292	them when he brought them forth out of the land of Egypt:
c21293	For they went
c21294	and served other gods,
c21295	and worshipped
c21296	them, gods
c21297	whom they knew not,
c21298	and <i>whom</i> he had not given unto them:
c21299	And the anger of the LORD was kindled against this land,
c21300	to bring upon it all the curses
c21301	that are written in this book:
c21302	And the LORD rooted them out of their land in anger, and in wrath, and in great indignation,
c21303	and cast them into another land,
c21304	as <i>it is</i> this day.
c21305	The secret <i>things belong</i> unto the LORD our God:
c21306	but those <i>things which are</i> revealed <i>belong</i> unto us and to our children for ever,
c21307	that <i>we</i> may do all the words of this law.
c21308	And it shall come to pass,
c21309	when all these things are come upon thee, the blessing and the curse,
c21310	which I have set before
c21311	thee, and thou shalt call <i>them</i> to mind among all the nations,
c21312	whither the LORD thy God hath driven thee,
c21313	And shalt return unto the LORD thy God,
c21314	and shalt obey his voice according to all
c21315	that I command thee this day,
c21316	thou and thy children, with all thine heart, and with all thy soul;
c21317	That then the LORD thy God will turn thy captivity,
c21318	and have compassion
c21319	upon thee, and will return
c21320	and gather thee from all the nations,
c21321	whither the LORD thy God hath scattered thee.
c21322	If <i>any</i> of thine be driven out unto the outmost <i>parts</i> of heaven,
c21323	from thence will the LORD thy God gather
c21324	thee, and from thence will he fetch thee:
c21325	And the LORD thy God will bring thee into the land
c21326	which thy fathers possessed,
c21327	and thou shalt possess
c21328	it; and he will do thee good,
c21329	and multiply thee above thy fathers.
c21330	And the LORD thy God will circumcise thine heart, and the heart of thy seed,
c21331	to love the LORD thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy soul,
c21332	that thou mayest live.
c21333	And the LORD thy God will put all these curses upon thine enemies, and on them that hate
c21334	thee, which persecuted thee.
c21335	And thou shalt return
c21336	and obey the voice of the LORD,
c21337	and do all his commandments
c21338	which I command thee this day.
c21339	And the LORD thy God will make thee plenteous in every work of thine hand, in the fruit of thy body, and in the fruit of thy cattle, and in the fruit of thy land, for good:
c21340	for the LORD will again
c21341	rejoice over thee for good,
c21342	as he rejoiced over thy fathers:
c21343	If thou shalt hearken unto the voice of the LORD thy God,
c21344	to keep his commandments and his statutes
c21345	which are written in this book of the law,
c21346	<i>and</i> if thou turn unto the LORD thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy soul.
c21347	For this commandment
c21348	which I command thee this day,
c21349	it <i>is</i> not hidden from
c21350	thee, neither <i>is</i> it far off.
c21351	It <i>is</i> not in heaven,
c21352	that thou shouldest say,
c21353	Who shall go up for us to heaven,
c21354	and bring
c21355	it unto us, that we may hear
c21356	it, and do it?
c21357	Neither <i>is</i> it beyond the sea,
c21358	that thou shouldest say,
c21359	Who shall go over the sea
c21360	for us, and bring
c21361	it unto us, that we may hear
c21362	it, and do it?
c21363	But the word <i>is</i> very nigh unto
c21364	thee, in thy mouth, and in thy heart,
c21365	that thou mayest do it.
c21366	See,
c21367	I have set before thee this day life and good, and death and evil;
c21368	In that I command thee this day
c21369	to love the LORD thy God,
c21370	to walk in his ways,
c21371	and to keep his commandments and his statutes and his judgments,
c21372	that thou mayest live
c21373	and multiply:
c21374	and the LORD thy God shall bless thee in the land
c21375	whither thou goest
c21376	to possess it.
c21377	But if thine heart turn away,
c21378	so that thou wilt not hear,
c21379	but shalt be drawn away,
c21380	and worship other gods,
c21381	and serve them;
c21382	I denounce unto you this day,
c21383	that ye shall surely perish,
c21384	<i>and that</i> ye shall not prolong <i>your</i> days upon the land,
c21385	whither thou passest over Jordan
c21386	to go
c21387	to possess it.
c21388	I call heaven and earth to record this day
c21389	against you, <i>that</i> I have set before you life and death,
c21390	blessing and cursing:
c21391	therefore choose life,
c21392	that both thou and thy seed may live:
c21393	That thou mayest love the LORD thy God,
c21394	<i>and</i> that thou mayest obey his voice,
c21395	and that thou mayest cleave
c21396	unto him: for he <i>is</i> thy life, and the length of thy days:
c21397	that thou mayest dwell in the land
c21398	which the LORD sware unto thy fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob,
c21399	to give them.
c21400	And Moses went
c21401	and spake these words unto all Israel.
c21402	And he said unto
c21403	them, I <i>am</i> an hundred and twenty years old this day;
c21404	I can no more
c21405	go out
c21406	and come in:
c21407	also the LORD hath said unto
c21408	me, Thou shalt not go over this Jordan.
c21409	The LORD thy God,
c21410	he will go over before
c21411	thee, <i>and</i> he will destroy these nations from before
c21412	thee, and thou shalt possess
c21413	them: <i>and</i> Joshua,
c21414	he shall go over before
c21415	thee, as the LORD hath said.
c21416	And the LORD shall do
c21417	unto them as he did to Sihon and to Og, kings of the Amorites, and unto the land
c21418	of them, whom he destroyed.
c21419	And the LORD shall give them up before your face,
c21420	that ye may do unto them according unto all the commandments
c21421	which I have commanded you.
c21422	Be strong
c21423	and of a good courage,
c21424	fear not,
c21425	nor be afraid of
c21426	them: for the LORD thy God,
c21427	he
c21428	<i>it is</i> that doth go with
c21429	thee; he will not fail
c21430	thee, nor forsake thee.
c21431	And Moses called unto Joshua,
c21432	and said unto him in the sight of all Israel,
c21433	Be strong
c21434	and of a good courage:
c21435	for thou must go with this people unto the land
c21436	which the LORD hath sworn unto their fathers
c21437	to give
c21438	them; and thou shalt cause them to inherit it.
c21439	And the LORD,
c21440	he
c21441	<i>it is</i> that doth go before
c21442	thee; he will be with thee,
c21443	he will not fail
c21444	thee, neither forsake
c21445	thee: fear not,
c21446	neither be dismayed.
c21447	And Moses wrote this law,
c21448	and delivered it unto the priests the sons of Levi,
c21449	which bare the ark of the covenant of the LORD,
c21450	and unto all the elders of Israel.
c21451	And Moses commanded
c21452	them, saying,
c21453	At the end of <i>every</i> seven years, in the solemnity of the year of release, in the feast of tabernacles,
c21454	When all Israel is come
c21455	to appear before the LORD thy God in the place
c21456	which he shall choose,
c21457	thou shalt read this law before all Israel in their hearing.
c21458	Gather the people together, men, and women, and children, and thy stranger
c21459	that <i>is</i> within thy gates,
c21460	that they may hear,
c21461	and that they may learn,
c21462	and fear the LORD your God,
c21463	and observe
c21464	to do all the words of this law:
c21465	And <i>that</i> their children,
c21466	which have not known
c21467	<i>any thing,</i> may hear,
c21468	and learn
c21469	to fear the LORD your God, as long as
c21470	ye live in the land
c21471	whither ye go over Jordan
c21472	to possess it.
c21473	And the LORD said unto Moses,
c21474	Behold, thy days approach
c21475	that thou must die:
c21476	call Joshua,
c21477	and present yourselves in the tabernacle of the congregation,
c21478	that I may give him a charge.
c21479	And Moses and Joshua went,
c21480	and presented themselves in the tabernacle of the congregation.
c21481	And the LORD appeared in the tabernacle in a pillar of a cloud:
c21482	and the pillar of the cloud stood over the door of the tabernacle.
c21483	And the LORD said unto Moses,
c21484	Behold, thou shalt sleep with thy fathers;
c21485	and this people will rise up,
c21486	and go a whoring after the gods of the strangers of the land,
c21487	whither they go <i>to be</i> among
c21488	them, and will forsake
c21489	me, and break my covenant
c21490	which I have made with them.
c21491	Then my anger shall be kindled against them in that day,
c21492	and I will forsake
c21493	them, and I will hide my face from
c21494	them, and they shall be
c21495	devoured,
c21496	and many evils and troubles shall befall
c21497	them; so that they will say in that day,
c21498	Are not
c21499	us, because our God <i>is</i> not among us?
c21500	these evils come upon
c21501	And I will surely hide my face in that day for all the evils
c21502	which they shall have wrought,
c21503	in that they are turned unto other gods.
c21504	Now
c21505	therefore write ye this song
c21506	for you, and teach it the children of Israel:
c21507	put it in their mouths,
c21508	that this song may be a witness for me against the children of Israel.
c21509	For when I shall have brought them into the land
c21510	which I sware unto their fathers,
c21511	that floweth with milk and honey;
c21512	and they shall have eaten
c21513	and filled themselves,
c21514	and waxen fat;
c21515	then will they turn unto other gods,
c21516	and serve
c21517	them, and provoke
c21518	me, and break my covenant.
c21519	And it shall come to pass,
c21520	when many evils and troubles are befallen
c21521	them, that this song shall testify against them as a witness;
c21522	for it shall not be forgotten out of the mouths of their seed:
c21523	for I know their imagination
c21524	which they go about, even now,
c21525	before I have brought them into the land
c21526	which I sware.
c21527	Moses therefore wrote this song the same day,
c21528	and taught it the children of Israel.
c21529	And he gave Joshua the son of Nun
c21530	a charge, and said,
c21531	Be strong
c21532	and of a good courage:
c21533	for thou shalt bring the children of Israel into the land
c21534	which I sware
c21535	unto them: and I will be with thee.
c21536	And it came to pass,
c21537	when Moses had made an end
c21538	of writing the words of this law in a book,
c21539	until they were finished,
c21540	That Moses commanded the Levites, which bare the ark of the covenant of the LORD,
c21541	saying,
c21542	Take this book of the law,
c21543	and put it in the side of the ark of the covenant of the LORD your God,
c21544	that it may be there for a witness against thee.
c21545	For I know thy rebellion, and thy stiff neck:
c21546	behold,
c21547	while I am yet alive with you this day,
c21548	ye have been rebellious against the LORD;
c21549	and how much more after my death?
c21550	Gather unto me all the elders of your tribes, and your officers,
c21551	that I may speak these words in their ears,
c21552	and call heaven and earth to record against them.
c21553	For I know that after my death
c21554	ye will utterly corrupt <i>yourselves,</i> and turn aside from the way
c21556	which I have commanded
c21557	you; and evil will befall you in the latter days; because
c21558	ye will do
c21559	evil in the sight of the LORD,
c21560	to provoke him to anger through the work of your hands.
c21561	And Moses spake in the ears of all the congregation of Israel the words of this song,
c21562	until they were ended.
c21563	Give ear,
c21564	O ye heavens,
c21565	and I will speak;
c21566	and hear, O earth, the words of my mouth.
c21567	My doctrine shall drop as the rain,
c21568	my speech shall distil as the dew,
c21569	as the small rain upon the tender herb,
c21570	and as the showers upon the grass:
c21571	Because I will publish the name of the LORD:
c21572	ascribe ye greatness unto our God.
c21573	<i>He is</i> the Rock,
c21574	his work <i>is</i> perfect:
c21575	for all his ways <i>are</i> judgment:
c21576	a God of truth and without iniquity,
c21577	just and right <i>is</i> he.
c21578	They have corrupted
c21579	themselves, their spot <i>is</i> not <i>the spot</i> of his children:
c21580	<i>they are</i> a perverse and crooked generation.
c21581	Do ye thus requite the LORD,
c21582	O foolish people and unwise?
c21583	<i>is</i> not he thy father
c21584	<i>that</i> hath bought
c21585	thee? hath he not made
c21586	thee, and established thee?
c21587	Remember the days of old,
c21588	consider the years of many generations:
c21589	ask thy father,
c21590	and he will shew
c21591	thee; thy elders,
c21592	and they will tell thee.
c21593	When the most High divided to the nations
c21594	their inheritance, when he separated the sons of Adam,
c21595	he set the bounds of the people according to the number of the children of Israel.
c21596	For the LORD'S portion <i>is</i> his people;
c21597	Jacob <i>is</i> the lot of his inheritance.
c21598	He found him in a desert land, and in the waste howling wilderness;
c21599	he led him about,
c21600	he instructed
c21601	him, he kept him as the apple of his eye.
c21602	As an eagle
c21603	stirreth up her nest,
c21604	fluttereth over her young,
c21605	spreadeth abroad her wings,
c21606	taketh
c21607	them, beareth them on her wings:
c21608	<i>So</i> the LORD alone did lead
c21609	him, and <i>there was</i> no strange god with him.
c21610	He made him ride on the high places of the earth,
c21611	that he might eat the increase of the fields;
c21612	and he made him to suck honey out of the rock,
c21613	and oil out of the flinty rock;
c21614	Butter of kine, and milk of sheep, with fat of lambs,
c21615	and rams of the breed of Bashan, and goats, with the fat of kidneys of wheat;
c21616	and thou didst drink the pure blood of the grape.
c21617	But Jeshurun waxed fat,
c21618	and kicked:
c21619	thou art waxen fat,
c21620	thou art grown thick,
c21621	thou art covered
c21622	<i>with fatness;</i> then he forsook God
c21623	<i>which</i> made
c21624	him, and lightly esteemed the Rock of his salvation.
c21625	They provoked him to jealousy with strange
c21626	<i>gods,</i> with abominations provoked they him to anger.
c21627	They sacrificed unto devils,
c21628	not to God;
c21629	to gods
c21630	whom they knew not,
c21631	to new
c21632	<i>gods that</i> came newly up,
c21633	whom your fathers feared not.
c21634	Of the Rock
c21635	<i>that</i> begat
c21636	thee thou art unmindful,
c21637	and hast forgotten God
c21638	that formed thee.
c21639	And when the LORD saw
c21640	<i>it,</i> he abhorred <i>them,</i> because of the provoking of his sons, and of his daughters.
c21641	And he said,
c21642	I will hide my face from
c21643	them, I will see
c21644	what their end
c21645	<i>shall be:</i> for they <i>are</i> a very froward generation,
c21646	children
c21647	in whom <i>is</i> no faith.
c21648	They have moved me to jealousy with <i>that which is</i> not God;
c21649	they have provoked me to anger with their vanities:
c21650	and I will move them to jealousy with <i>those which are</i> not a people;
c21651	I will provoke them to anger with a foolish nation.
c21652	For a fire is kindled in mine anger,
c21653	and shall burn unto the lowest hell,
c21654	and shall consume the earth with her increase,
c21655	and set on fire the foundations of the mountains.
c21656	I will heap mischiefs upon
c21657	them; I will spend mine arrows upon them.
c21658	<i>They shall be</i> burnt with hunger,
c21659	and devoured with burning heat, and with bitter destruction:
c21660	I will also send the teeth of beasts upon them, with the poison of serpents of the dust.
c21661	The sword without, and terror within, shall destroy
c21663	both the young man and the virgin,
c21664	the suckling <i>also</i> with the man of gray hairs.
c21665	I said,
c21666	I would scatter them into corners,
c21667	I would make the remembrance of them to cease from among men:
c21668	Were it not that I feared the wrath of the enemy,
c21669	lest their adversaries should behave themselves strangely,
c21670	<i>and</i> lest they should say,
c21671	Our hand <i>is</i> high,
c21672	and the LORD hath not done all this.
c21673	For they <i>are</i> a nation void of counsel,
c21674	neither <i>is there any</i> understanding in them.
c21675	O that they were wise,
c21676	<i>that</i> they understood this,
c21677	<i>that</i> they would consider their latter end!
c21678	How should one chase a thousand,
c21679	and two put ten thousand to flight,
c21680	except
c21681	their Rock had sold
c21682	them, and the LORD had shut them up?
c21683	For their rock <i>is</i> not as our Rock,
c21684	even our enemies themselves <i>being</i> judges.
c21685	For their vine <i>is</i> of the vine of Sodom,
c21686	and of the fields of Gomorrah:
c21687	their grapes <i>are</i> grapes of gall,
c21688	their clusters <i>are</i> bitter:
c21689	Their wine <i>is</i> the poison of dragons,
c21690	and the cruel venom of asps.
c21691	<i>Is</i> not this laid up in store with
c21692	me, <i>and</i> sealed up among my treasures?
c21693	To me <i>belongeth</i> vengeance, and recompence; their foot shall slide in <i>due</i> time:
c21695	for the day of their calamity <i>is</i> at hand,
c21696	upon them make haste.
c21697	and the things that shall come
c21698	For the LORD shall judge his people,
c21699	and repent himself for his servants,
c21700	when he seeth
c21701	that <i>their</i> power is gone,
c21702	and <i>there is</i> none shut up, or left.
c21703	And he shall say,
c21704	Where <i>are</i> their gods,
c21705	<i>their</i> rock
c21706	in whom they trusted,
c21707	Which did eat the fat of their sacrifices,
c21708	<i>and</i> drank the wine of their drink offerings?
c21709	let them rise up
c21710	and help
c21711	you, <i>and</i> be your protection.
c21712	See now
c21713	that I,
c21714	<i>even</i> I, <i>am</i> he,
c21715	and <i>there is</i> no god with
c21716	me: I kill,
c21717	and I make alive;
c21718	I wound,
c21719	and I heal:
c21720	neither <i>is there any</i> that can deliver out of my hand.
c21721	For I lift up my hand to heaven,
c21722	and say,
c21723	I live for ever.
c21724	If I whet my glittering sword,
c21725	and mine hand take hold on judgment;
c21726	I will render vengeance to mine enemies,
c21727	and will reward them that hate me.
c21728	I will make mine arrows drunk with blood,
c21729	and my sword shall devour flesh; <i>and that</i> with the blood of the slain and of the captives, from the beginning of revenges upon the enemy.
c21730	Rejoice,
c21731	O ye nations,
c21732	<i>with</i> his people:
c21733	for he will avenge the blood of his servants,
c21734	and will render vengeance to his adversaries,
c21735	and will be merciful unto his land, <i>and</i> to his people.
c21736	And Moses came
c21737	and spake all the words of this song in the ears of the people, he, and Hoshea the son of Nun.
c21738	And Moses made an end
c21739	of speaking all these words to all Israel:
c21740	And he said unto
c21741	them, Set your hearts unto all the words
c21742	which I testify among you this day,
c21743	which ye shall command your children
c21744	to observe
c21745	to do, all the words of this law.
c21746	For it <i>is</i> not a vain thing for
c21747	you; because it <i>is</i> your life:
c21748	and through this thing ye shall prolong <i>your</i> days in the land,
c21749	whither ye go over Jordan
c21750	to possess it.
c21751	And the LORD spake unto Moses that selfsame day,
c21752	saying,
c21753	Get thee up into this mountain Abarim, <i>unto</i> mount Nebo,
c21754	which <i>is</i> in the land of Moab,
c21755	that <i>is</i> over against Jericho;
c21756	and behold the land of Canaan,
c21757	which I give unto the children of Israel for a possession:
c21758	And die in the mount
c21759	whither thou goest up,
c21760	and be gathered unto thy people;
c21761	as Aaron thy brother died in mount Hor,
c21762	and was gathered unto his people:
c21763	Because ye trespassed against me among the children of Israel at the waters of Meribah-Kadesh, in the wilderness of Zin;
c21764	because ye sanctified me not in the midst of the children of Israel.
c21765	Yet thou shalt see the land before
c21766	<i>thee;</i> but thou shalt not go thither unto the land
c21767	which I give the children of Israel.
c21768	And this <i>is</i> the blessing,
c21769	wherewith Moses the man of God blessed the children of Israel before his death.
c21770	And he said,
c21771	The LORD came from Sinai,
c21772	and rose up from Seir
c21773	unto them; he shined forth from mount Paran,
c21774	and he came with ten thousands of saints:
c21775	from his right hand <i>went</i> a fiery law for them.
c21776	Yea, he loved the people;
c21777	all his saints <i>are</i> in thy hand:
c21778	and they sat down at thy feet;
c21779	<i>every one</i> shall receive of thy words.
c21780	Moses commanded us a law,
c21781	<i>even</i> the inheritance of the congregation of Jacob.
c21782	And he was king in Jeshurun,
c21783	when the heads of the people <i>and</i> the tribes of Israel were gathered together.
c21784	Let Reuben live,
c21785	and not die;
c21786	and let <i>not</i> his men be few.
c21787	And this <i>is the blessing</i> of Judah:
c21788	and he said,
c21789	Hear,
c21790	LORD,
c21791	the voice of Judah,
c21792	and bring him unto his people:
c21793	let his hands be sufficient
c21794	for him; and be thou an help <i>to him</i> from his enemies.
c21795	And of Levi he said,
c21796	<i>Let</i> thy Thummim and thy Urim <i>be</i> with thy holy one,
c21797	whom thou didst prove at Massah,
c21798	<i>and with</i> whom thou didst strive at the waters of Meribah;
c21799	Who said unto his father and to his mother,
c21800	I have not seen
c21801	him; neither did he acknowledge his brethren,
c21802	nor knew his own children:
c21803	for they have observed thy word,
c21804	and kept thy covenant.
c21805	They shall teach Jacob thy judgments,
c21806	and Israel thy law:
c21807	they shall put incense before
c21808	thee, and whole burnt sacrifice upon thine altar.
c21809	Bless,
c21810	LORD,
c21811	his substance,
c21812	and accept the work of his hands:
c21813	smite through the loins of them that rise against him, and of them that hate
c21814	him, that they rise not again.
c21815	<i>And</i> of Benjamin he said,
c21816	The beloved of the LORD
c21817	shall dwell in safety by
c21818	him; <i>and the LORD</i> shall cover him all the day
c21819	long, and he shall dwell between his shoulders.
c21820	And of Joseph he said,
c21821	Blessed of the LORD <i>be</i> his land, for the precious things of heaven, for the dew, and for the deep
c21822	that coucheth beneath,
c21823	And for the precious fruits <i>brought forth</i> by the sun,
c21824	and for the precious things put forth by the moon,
c21825	And for the chief things of the ancient mountains,
c21826	and for the precious things of the lasting hills,
c21827	And for the precious things of the earth and fulness
c21828	thereof, and <i>for</i> the good will of him that dwelt in the bush:
c21829	let <i>the blessing</i> come upon the head of Joseph, and upon the top of the head of him <i>that was</i> separated from his brethren.
c21830	<i>is like</i> the firstling of his bullock,
c21831	His glory
c21832	and his horns <i>are like</i> the horns of unicorns:
c21833	with them he shall push the people together to the ends of the earth:
c21834	and they <i>are</i> the ten thousands of Ephraim,
c21835	and they <i>are</i> the thousands of Manasseh.
c21836	And of Zebulun he said,
c21837	Rejoice,
c21838	Zebulun,
c21839	in thy going out;
c21841	and, Issachar,
c21842	in thy tents.
c21843	They shall call the people unto the mountain;
c21844	there they shall offer sacrifices of righteousness:
c21845	for they shall suck <i>of</i> the abundance of the seas,
c21846	and <i>of</i> treasures hid in the sand.
c21847	And of Gad he said,
c21848	Blessed <i>be</i> he that enlargeth Gad:
c21849	he dwelleth as a lion,
c21850	and teareth the arm
c21851	with the crown of the head.
c21852	And he provided the first part
c21853	for himself, because there, <i>in</i> a portion of the lawgiver, <i>was he</i> seated;
c21854	and he came with the heads of the people,
c21855	he executed the justice of the LORD,
c21856	and his judgments with Israel.
c21857	And of Dan he said,
c21858	Dan <i>is</i> a lion's whelp:
c21859	he shall leap from Bashan.
c21860	And of Naphtali he said,
c21861	O Naphtali, satisfied with favour,
c21862	and full with the blessing of the LORD:
c21863	possess thou the west and the south.
c21864	And of Asher he said,
c21865	<i>Let</i> Asher <i>be</i> blessed with children;
c21866	let him be acceptable to his brethren,
c21867	and let him dip his foot in oil.
c21868	Thy shoes <i>shall be</i> iron and brass;
c21869	and as thy days, <i>so shall</i> thy strength <i>be.</i>
c21870	<i>There is</i> none like unto the God
c21871	of Jeshurun,
c21872	<i>who</i> rideth upon the heaven in thy help,
c21873	and in his excellency on the sky.
c21874	The eternal God <i>is thy</i> refuge,
c21875	and underneath <i>are</i> the everlasting arms:
c21876	and he shall thrust out the enemy from before
c21877	thee; and shall say,
c21878	Destroy <i>them.</i>
c21879	Israel then shall dwell in safety
c21880	alone: the fountain of Jacob <i>shall be</i> upon a land of corn and wine;
c21881	also his heavens shall drop down dew.
c21882	Happy <i>art</i> thou, O Israel:
c21883	who <i>is</i> like unto thee,
c21884	O people
c21885	saved by the LORD, the shield of thy help,
c21886	and who <i>is</i> the sword of thy excellency!
c21887	and thine enemies shall be found liars
c21888	unto thee; and thou shalt tread upon their high places.
c21889	And Moses went up from the plains of Moab unto the mountain of Nebo, to the top of Pisgah,
c21890	that <i>is</i> over against Jericho.
c21891	And the LORD shewed him all the land of Gilead, unto Dan,
c21892	And all Naphtali, and the land of Ephraim, and Manasseh, and all the land of Judah, unto the utmost sea,
c21893	And the south, and the plain of the valley of Jericho, the city of palm trees, unto Zoar.
c21894	And the LORD said unto
c21895	him, This <i>is</i> the land
c21896	which I sware unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob,
c21897	saying,
c21898	I will give it unto thy seed:
c21899	I have caused thee to see <i>it</i> with thine eyes,
c21900	but thou shalt not go over thither.
c21901	So Moses the servant of the LORD died there in the land of Moab, according to the word of the LORD.
c21902	And he buried him in a valley in the land of Moab, over against Bethpeor:
c21903	but no man knoweth of his sepulchre unto this day.
c21904	And Moses <i>was</i> an hundred and twenty years old when he died:
c21905	his eye was not dim,
c21906	nor his natural force abated.
c21907	And the children of Israel wept for Moses in the plains of Moab thirty days:
c21908	so the days of weeping <i>and</i> mourning for Moses were ended.
c21909	And Joshua the son of Nun was full of the spirit of wisdom;
c21910	for Moses had laid his hands upon
c21911	him: and the children of Israel hearkened unto
c21912	him, and did
c21913	as the LORD commanded Moses.
c21914	And there arose not a prophet since in Israel like unto Moses,
c21915	whom the LORD knew face to face,
c21916	In all the signs and the wonders,
c21917	which the LORD sent
c21918	him to do in the land of Egypt to Pharaoh, and to all his servants, and to all his land,
c21919	And in all that mighty hand, and in all the great terror
c21920	which Moses shewed in the sight of all Israel.
c21921	Now after the death of Moses the servant of the LORD it came to pass,
c21922	that the LORD spake unto Joshua the son of Nun, Moses' minister,
c21923	saying,
c21924	Moses my servant is dead;
c21925	now
c21926	therefore arise,
c21927	go over this Jordan, thou, and all this people, unto the land
c21928	which I do give to them, <i>even</i> to the children of Israel.
c21929	Every place
c21930	that the sole of your foot shall tread
c21931	upon, that have I given
c21932	unto you, as I said unto Moses.
c21933	From the wilderness and this Lebanon even unto the great river, the river Euphrates, all the land of the Hittites, and unto the great sea toward the going down of the sun, shall be your coast.
c21934	There shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life:
c21935	as I was with Moses,
c21936	<i>so</i> I will be with
c21937	thee: I will not fail
c21938	thee, nor forsake thee.
c21939	Be strong
c21940	and of a good courage:
c21941	for unto this people shalt thou divide for an inheritance the land,
c21942	which I sware unto their fathers
c21943	to give them.
c21944	Only be thou strong
c21945	and very courageous,
c21946	that thou mayest observe
c21947	to do according to all the law,
c21948	which Moses my servant commanded
c21949	thee: turn not from it <i>to</i> the right hand or <i>to</i> the left,
c21950	that thou mayest prosper whithersoever
c21951	thou goest.
c21952	This book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth;
c21953	but thou shalt meditate therein day and night,
c21954	that thou mayest observe
c21955	to do according to all
c21956	that is written
c21957	therein: for then thou shalt make thy way prosperous,
c21958	and then thou shalt have good success.
c21959	Have not I commanded
c21960	thee? Be strong
c21961	and of a good courage;
c21962	be not afraid,
c21963	neither be thou dismayed:
c21964	for the LORD thy God <i>is</i> with thee whithersoever
c21965	thou goest.
c21966	Then Joshua commanded the officers of the people,
c21967	saying,
c21968	Pass through the host,
c21969	and command the people,
c21970	saying,
c21971	Prepare you victuals;
c21972	for within three days ye shall pass over this Jordan,
c21973	to go in
c21974	to possess the land,
c21975	which the LORD your God giveth
c21976	you to possess it.
c21977	And to the Reubenites, and to the Gadites, and to half the tribe of Manasseh, spake Joshua,
c21978	saying,
c21979	Remember the word
c21980	which Moses the servant of the LORD commanded
c21981	you, saying,
c21982	The LORD your God hath given you rest,
c21983	and hath given you this land.
c21984	Your wives, your little ones, and your cattle, shall remain in the land
c21985	which Moses gave you on this side Jordan;
c21986	but ye shall pass before your brethren armed, all the mighty men of valour,
c21987	and help them;
c21988	Until the LORD have given your brethren rest,
c21989	as <i>he hath given</i> you, and they also have possessed the land
c21990	which the LORD your God giveth
c21991	them: then ye shall return unto the land of your possession,
c21992	and enjoy
c21993	it, which Moses the LORD'S servant gave you on this side Jordan toward the sunrising.
c21994	And they answered Joshua,
c21995	saying,
c21996	All
c21997	that thou commandest
c21998	us we will do,
c21999	and whithersoever
c22000	thou sendest
c22001	us, we will go.
c22003	According as we hearkened unto Moses in all things,
c22004	so will we hearken unto
c22005	thee: only the LORD thy God be with
c22006	thee, as he was with Moses.
c22007	Whosoever
c22008	<i>he be</i> that doth rebel against thy commandment,
c22009	and will not hearken unto thy words in all
c22010	that thou commandest
c22011	him, he shall be put to death:
c22012	only be strong
c22013	and of a good courage.
c22014	And Joshua the son of Nun sent out of Shittim two men
c22015	to spy secretly,
c22016	saying,
c22017	Go
c22018	view the land, even Jericho.
c22019	And they went,
c22020	and came into an harlot's house,
c22021	named Rahab,
c22022	and lodged there.
c22023	And it was told the king of Jericho,
c22024	saying,
c22025	Behold,
c22026	there came men in hither to night of the children of Israel
c22027	to search out the country.
c22028	And the king of Jericho sent unto Rahab,
c22029	saying,
c22030	Bring forth the men
c22031	that are come to
c22032	thee, which are entered into thine house:
c22033	for
c22034	to search out all the country.
c22035	they be come
c22036	And the woman took the two men,
c22037	and hid
c22038	them, and said
c22039	thus, There came men unto
c22040	me, but I wist not
c22041	whence they <i>were:</i>
c22042	And it came to pass
c22044	<i>about the time</i> of shutting of the gate, when it was dark,
c22045	that the men went out:
c22046	I wot not:
c22047	whither the men went
c22048	pursue after them quickly;
c22049	for ye shall overtake them.
c22050	But she had brought them up to the roof
c22051	of the house, and hid them with the stalks of flax,
c22052	which she had laid in order upon the roof.
c22053	And the men pursued after them the way to Jordan unto the fords:
c22054	they shut the gate.
c22055	and as soon as they which pursued after them were gone out,
c22058	And before they were laid down,
c22059	she came up unto them upon the roof;
c22060	And she said unto the men,
c22061	I know
c22062	that the LORD hath given you the land,
c22063	and that your terror is fallen upon
c22064	us, and that all the inhabitants of the land faint because of you.
c22065	For we have heard
c22066	how the LORD dried up the water of the Red sea for
c22067	you, when ye came out of Egypt;
c22068	and what ye did unto the two kings of the Amorites,
c22069	that <i>were</i> on the other side Jordan,
c22070	Sihon and Og,
c22071	whom ye utterly destroyed.
c22072	And as soon as we had heard
c22073	<i>these things,</i> our hearts did melt,
c22074	neither did there remain any more courage in any man, because of
c22075	you: for the LORD your God,
c22076	he <i>is</i> God in heaven above, and in earth beneath.
c22077	Now
c22078	therefore, I pray you, swear unto me by the LORD,
c22079	since I have shewed you kindness,
c22080	that ye will also shew kindness unto my father's house,
c22081	and give me a true token:
c22082	And <i>that</i> ye will save alive my father, and my mother, and my brethren, and my sisters, and all
c22083	that
c22084	they have, and deliver our lives from death.
c22085	And the men answered
c22086	her, Our life for
c22088	yours, if ye utter not this our business.
c22089	And it shall be,
c22090	when the LORD hath given us the land,
c22091	that we will deal kindly and truly with thee.
c22092	Then she let them down by a cord through the window:
c22093	for her house <i>was</i> upon the town wall,
c22094	and she dwelt upon the wall.
c22095	And she said
c22096	unto them, Get you to the mountain,
c22097	lest the pursuers meet
c22098	you; and hide yourselves there three days,
c22099	until the pursuers be returned:
c22100	and afterward may ye go your way.
c22101	And the men said unto
c22102	her, We <i>will be</i> blameless of this thine oath
c22103	which thou hast made us swear.
c22104	Behold, <i>when</i> we come into the land,
c22105	thou shalt bind this line of scarlet thread in the window
c22106	which thou didst let us down
c22107	by: and thou shalt bring thy father, and thy mother, and thy brethren, and all thy father's household, home unto thee.
c22108	And it shall be,
c22109	<i>that</i> whosoever
c22110	shall go out of the doors of thy house into the street,
c22111	his blood <i>shall be</i> upon his head,
c22112	and we <i>will be</i> guiltless:
c22113	and whosoever
c22114	shall be with thee in the house,
c22115	his blood <i>shall be</i> on our head,
c22116	if <i>any</i> hand be upon him.
c22117	And if thou utter this our business,
c22118	then we will be quit of thine oath
c22119	which thou hast made us to swear.
c22120	And she said,
c22121	According unto your words,
c22122	so <i>be</i> it.
c22123	And she sent them away,
c22124	and they departed:
c22125	and she bound the scarlet line in the window.
c22126	And they went,
c22127	and came unto the mountain,
c22128	and abode there three days,
c22129	until the pursuers were returned:
c22130	and the pursuers sought <i>them</i> throughout all the way,
c22131	but found <i>them</i> not.
c22132	So the two men returned,
c22133	and descended from the mountain,
c22134	and passed over,
c22135	and came to Joshua the son of Nun,
c22136	and told him all
c22137	<i>things</i> that befell them:
c22138	And they said unto Joshua,
c22139	Truly the LORD hath delivered into our hands all the land;
c22140	for even all the inhabitants of the country do faint because of us.
c22141	And Joshua rose early in the morning;
c22142	and they removed from Shittim,
c22143	and came to Jordan, he and all the children of Israel,
c22144	and lodged there
c22145	before they passed over.
c22146	And it came to pass after three days,
c22147	that the officers went through the host;
c22148	And they commanded the people,
c22149	saying,
c22150	When ye see the ark of the covenant of the LORD your God, and the priests the Levites
c22151	bearing
c22152	it, then ye shall remove from your place,
c22153	and go after it.
c22154	Yet there shall be a space between you and it, about two thousand cubits by measure:
c22155	come not near unto
c22156	it, that ye may know the way
c22157	by which ye must go:
c22158	for ye have not passed <i>this</i> way heretofore.
c22159	And Joshua said unto the people,
c22160	Sanctify yourselves:
c22161	for to morrow the LORD will do wonders among you.
c22162	And Joshua spake unto the priests,
c22163	saying,
c22164	Take up the ark of the covenant,
c22165	and pass over before the people.
c22166	And they took up the ark of the covenant,
c22167	and went before the people.
c22168	And the LORD said unto Joshua,
c22169	This day will I begin
c22170	to magnify thee in the sight of all Israel,
c22171	that they may know
c22172	that,
c22173	as I was with Moses,
c22174	<i>so</i> I will be with thee.
c22175	And thou shalt command the priests that bear the ark of the covenant,
c22176	saying,
c22177	When ye are come to the brink of the water of Jordan,
c22178	ye shall stand still in Jordan.
c22179	And Joshua said unto the children of Israel,
c22180	Come hither,
c22181	and hear the words of the LORD your God.
c22182	And Joshua said,
c22183	Hereby ye shall know
c22184	that the living God <i>is</i> among
c22185	you, and <i>that</i> he will without fail drive out from before you the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Hivites, and the Perizzites, and the Girgashites, and the Amorites, and the Jebusites.
c22186	Behold, the ark of the covenant of the Lord of all the earth passeth over before you into Jordan.
c22187	Now
c22188	therefore take you twelve men out of the tribes of Israel,
c22189	out of every tribe a man.
c22190	And it shall come to pass,
c22191	as soon as the soles of the feet of the priests that bear the ark of the LORD, the Lord of all the earth, shall rest in the waters of Jordan,
c22192	<i>that</i> the waters of Jordan shall be cut off
c22193	<i>from</i> the waters
c22194	that come down from above;
c22195	and they shall stand upon an heap.
c22196	And it came to pass,
c22197	when the people removed from their tents,
c22198	to pass over Jordan,
c22199	and the priests bearing the ark of the covenant before the people;
c22200	And as they that bare the ark were come unto Jordan,
c22201	and the feet of the priests that bare the ark were dipped in the brim of the water,
c22202	(for Jordan overfloweth all his banks all the time of harvest,)
c22203	That the waters which came down from above stood
c22205	<i>and</i> rose up upon an heap very far from the city Adam,
c22206	that <i>is</i> beside Zaretan:
c22208	and those that came down toward the sea of the plain, <i>even</i> the salt sea,
c22209	failed,
c22210	<i>and</i> were cut off:
c22211	and the people passed over right against Jericho.
c22212	And the priests that bare the ark of the covenant of the LORD stood firm on dry ground in the midst of Jordan,
c22213	and all the Israelites passed over on dry ground,
c22214	until all the people were passed clean
c22215	over Jordan.
c22216	And it came to pass,
c22217	when all the people were clean
c22218	passed over Jordan,
c22219	that the LORD spake unto Joshua,
c22220	saying,
c22221	Take you twelve men out of the people,
c22222	out of every tribe a man,
c22223	And command
c22224	ye them, saying,
c22225	Take you hence out of the midst of Jordan, out of the place where the priests' feet
c22226	stood firm,
c22227	twelve stones,
c22228	and ye shall carry them over with
c22229	you, and leave them in the lodging place,
c22230	where ye shall lodge this night.
c22231	Then Joshua called the twelve men,
c22232	whom he had prepared
c22233	of the children of Israel, out of every tribe a man:
c22234	And Joshua said
c22235	unto them, Pass over before the ark of the LORD your God into the midst of Jordan,
c22236	and take ye up
c22237	every man of you a stone upon his shoulder, according unto the number of the tribes of the children of Israel:
c22238	That this may be a sign among
c22239	you, <i>that</i> when your children ask <i>their fathers</i> in time to come,
c22240	saying,
c22241	What <i>mean</i> ye by these stones?
c22242	Then ye shall answer
c22243	them, That the waters of Jordan were cut off before the ark of the covenant of the LORD;
c22244	when it passed over Jordan,
c22245	the waters of Jordan were cut off:
c22246	and these stones shall be for a memorial unto the children of Israel for ever.
c22247	And the children of Israel did so
c22248	as Joshua commanded,
c22249	and took up twelve stones out of the midst of Jordan,
c22250	as the LORD spake unto Joshua,
c22251	according to the number of the tribes of the children of Israel,
c22252	and carried them over with them unto the place where they lodged,
c22253	and laid them down there.
c22254	And Joshua set up twelve stones in the midst of Jordan, in the place where the feet of the priests which bare the ark of the covenant stood:
c22255	and they are there unto this day.
c22256	For the priests which bare the ark stood in the midst of Jordan,
c22257	until every thing was finished
c22258	that the LORD commanded Joshua
c22259	to speak unto the people, according to all
c22260	that Moses commanded Joshua:
c22261	and the people hasted
c22262	and passed over.
c22263	And it came to pass,
c22264	when all the people were clean
c22265	passed over,
c22266	that the ark of the LORD passed over, and the priests, in the presence of the people.
c22267	And the children of Reuben, and the children of Gad, and half the tribe of Manasseh, passed over armed before the children of Israel,
c22268	as Moses spake unto them:
c22269	About forty thousand prepared for war passed over before the LORD unto battle, to the plains of Jericho.
c22270	On that day the LORD magnified Joshua in the sight of all Israel;
c22271	and they feared
c22272	him, as they feared Moses, all the days of his life.
c22273	And the LORD spake unto Joshua,
c22274	saying,
c22275	Command the priests that bear the ark of the testimony,
c22276	that they come up out of Jordan.
c22277	Joshua therefore commanded the priests,
c22278	saying,
c22279	Come ye up out of Jordan.
c22280	And it came to pass,
c22281	when the priests that bare the ark of the covenant of the LORD were come up out of the midst of Jordan,
c22282	<i>and</i> the soles of the priests' feet were lifted up unto the dry land,
c22283	that the waters of Jordan returned unto their place,
c22284	and flowed over all his banks, as <i>they did</i> before.
c22285	And the people came up out of Jordan on the tenth <i>day</i> of the first month,
c22286	and encamped in Gilgal, in the east border of Jericho.
c22287	And those twelve stones,
c22288	which they took out of Jordan,
c22289	did Joshua pitch in Gilgal.
c22290	And he spake unto the children of Israel,
c22291	saying,
c22292	When your children shall ask their fathers in time to come,
c22293	saying,
c22294	What <i>mean</i> these stones?
c22295	Then ye shall let your children know,
c22296	saying,
c22297	Israel came over this Jordan on dry land.
c22298	For the LORD your God dried up the waters of Jordan from before
c22299	you, until ye were passed over,
c22300	as the LORD your God did to the Red sea,
c22301	which he dried up from before
c22302	us, until we were gone over:
c22303	That all the people of the earth might know the hand of the LORD,
c22304	that it <i>is</i> mighty:
c22305	that ye might fear the LORD your God for ever.
c22306	And it came to pass,
c22307	when all the kings of the Amorites, which <i>were</i> on the side of Jordan westward,
c22309	and all the kings of the Canaanites,
c22310	which <i>were</i> by the sea, heard
c22311	that the LORD had dried up the waters of Jordan from before the children of Israel,
c22312	until we were passed over,
c22313	that their heart melted,
c22314	neither was there spirit in them any more, because of the children of Israel.
c22315	At that time the LORD said unto Joshua,
c22316	Make thee sharp knives,
c22318	and circumcise again the children of Israel the second time.
c22319	And Joshua made him sharp knives,
c22320	and circumcised the children of Israel at the hill of the foreskins.
c22321	And this <i>is</i> the cause
c22322	why Joshua did circumcise:
c22323	All the people
c22324	that came out of Egypt,
c22325	<i>that were</i> males,
c22326	<i>even</i> all the men of war, died in the wilderness by the way,
c22327	after they came out of Egypt.
c22328	Now all the people that came out were circumcised:
c22330	but all the people
c22331	<i>that were</i> born in the wilderness by the way
c22332	as they came forth out of Egypt,
c22333	<i>them</i> they had not circumcised.
c22334	For the children of Israel walked forty years in the wilderness,
c22335	till all the people <i>that were</i> men of war, which came out of Egypt, were consumed,
c22337	because they obeyed not the voice of the LORD:
c22338	unto whom the LORD sware
c22339	that he would not shew them the land,
c22340	which the LORD sware unto their fathers
c22341	that he would give
c22342	us, a land that floweth with milk and honey.
c22343	And their children, <i>whom</i> he raised up in their stead,
c22344	them Joshua circumcised:
c22345	for they were uncircumcised,
c22346	because they had not circumcised them by the way.
c22347	And it came to pass,
c22348	when they had done circumcising all the people,
c22350	that they abode in their places in the camp,
c22351	till they were whole.
c22352	And the LORD said unto Joshua,
c22353	This day have I rolled away the reproach of Egypt from off
c22354	you. Wherefore the name of the place is called Gilgal unto this day.
c22355	And the children of Israel encamped in Gilgal,
c22356	and kept the passover on the fourteenth day of the month at even in the plains of Jericho.
c22357	And they did eat of the old corn of the land on the morrow after the passover, unleavened cakes, and parched <i>corn</i> in the selfsame day.
c22358	And the manna ceased on the morrow
c22359	after they had eaten of the old corn of the land;
c22360	neither had the children of Israel manna any more;
c22361	but they did eat of the fruit of the land of Canaan that year.
c22362	And it came to pass,
c22363	when Joshua was by Jericho,
c22364	that he lifted up his eyes
c22365	and looked,
c22366	and, behold, there stood a man over against
c22367	him with his sword drawn in his hand:
c22368	and Joshua went unto him,
c22369	and said
c22370	unto him, <i>Art</i> thou
c22371	for us, or for our adversaries?
c22372	And he said,
c22373	Nay;
c22374	but <i>as</i> captain of the host of the LORD am I
c22375	now come.
c22376	And Joshua fell on his face to the earth,
c22377	and did worship,
c22378	and said
c22379	unto him, What saith my lord unto his servant?
c22380	And the captain of the LORD'S host said unto Joshua,
c22381	Loose thy shoe from off thy foot;
c22382	for the place
c22383	whereon thou standest
c22384	<i>is</i> holy.
c22385	And Joshua did so.
c22386	Now Jericho was straitly shut up
c22387	because of the children of Israel:
c22388	none went out,
c22389	and none came in.
c22390	And the LORD said unto Joshua,
c22391	See,
c22392	I have given into thine hand Jericho, and the king thereof, <i>and</i> the mighty men of valour.
c22393	And ye shall compass the city,
c22394	all <i>ye</i> men of war, <i>and</i> go round about the city once.
c22395	Thus shalt thou do six days.
c22396	And seven priests shall bear before the ark seven trumpets of rams' horns:
c22397	and the seventh day ye shall compass the city seven times,
c22398	and the priests shall blow with the trumpets.
c22399	And it shall come to pass,
c22400	that when they make a long <i>blast</i> with the ram's horn,
c22401	<i>and</i> when ye hear the sound of the trumpet,
c22402	all the people shall shout with a great shout;
c22403	and the wall of the city shall fall down flat,
c22404	and the people shall ascend up
c22405	every man straight before him.
c22406	And Joshua the son of Nun called the priests,
c22407	and said unto
c22408	them, Take up the ark of the covenant,
c22409	and let seven priests bear seven trumpets of rams' horns before the ark of the LORD.
c22410	And he said unto the people,
c22411	Pass on,
c22412	and compass the city,
c22413	and let him that is armed pass on before the ark of the LORD.
c22414	And it came to pass,
c22415	when Joshua had spoken unto the people,
c22416	that the seven priests
c22417	bearing the seven trumpets of rams' horns passed on before the LORD,
c22419	and blew with the trumpets:
c22420	and the ark of the covenant of the LORD followed them.
c22421	And the armed men went before the priests that blew with the trumpets,
c22422	and the rereward came after the ark,
c22423	<i>the priests</i> going on,
c22424	and blowing with the trumpets.
c22425	And Joshua had commanded the people, saying,
c22427	Ye shall not shout,
c22428	nor make any noise with your voice,
c22429	neither shall <i>any</i> word proceed out of your mouth, until the day
c22430	I bid
c22431	you shout;
c22432	then shall ye shout.
c22433	So the ark of the LORD compassed the city,
c22434	going about <i>it</i> once:
c22435	and they came into the camp,
c22436	and lodged in the camp.
c22437	And Joshua rose early in the morning,
c22438	and the priests took up the ark of the LORD.
c22439	And seven priests
c22440	bearing seven trumpets of rams' horns before the ark of the LORD
c22441	went on continually,
c22443	and blew with the trumpets:
c22444	and the armed men went before
c22445	them; but the rereward came after the ark of the LORD,
c22446	<i>the priests</i> going on,
c22447	and blowing with the trumpets.
c22448	And the second day they compassed the city once,
c22449	and returned into the camp:
c22450	so they did six days.
c22451	And it came to pass on the seventh day,
c22452	that they rose early
c22453	about the dawning of the day,
c22454	and compassed the city after the same manner seven times:
c22455	only on that day they compassed the city seven times.
c22456	And it came to pass at the seventh time,
c22457	when the priests blew with the trumpets,
c22458	Joshua said unto the people,
c22459	Shout;
c22460	for the LORD hath given you the city.
c22461	And the city shall be accursed, <i>even</i> it, and all
c22462	that
c22463	<i>are</i> therein, to the LORD:
c22464	only Rahab the harlot shall live, she and all
c22465	that <i>are</i> with her in the house,
c22466	because she hid the messengers
c22467	that we sent.
c22468	And ye, in any wise keep <i>yourselves</i> from the accursed thing,
c22469	lest ye make <i>yourselves</i> accursed,
c22470	when ye take of the accursed thing,
c22471	and make the camp of Israel a curse,
c22472	and trouble it.
c22473	But all the silver, and gold, and vessels of brass and iron,
c22474	<i>are</i> consecrated unto the LORD:
c22475	they shall come into the treasury of the LORD.
c22476	So the people shouted
c22477	when <i>the priests</i> blew with the trumpets:
c22478	and it came to pass,
c22479	when the people heard the sound of the trumpet,
c22480	and the people shouted with a great shout,
c22481	that the wall fell down flat,
c22482	so that the people went up into the city,
c22483	every man straight before
c22484	him, and they took the city.
c22485	And they utterly destroyed all
c22486	that <i>was</i> in the city,
c22487	both man and woman, young and old, and ox, and sheep, and ass, with the edge of the sword.
c22488	unto the two men
c22489	that had spied out the country,
c22490	But Joshua had said
c22491	Go into the harlot's house,
c22492	and bring out thence the woman, and all
c22493	that
c22494	she hath, as ye sware unto her.
c22495	And the young men that were spies went in,
c22496	and brought out Rahab, and her father, and her mother, and her brethren, and all
c22497	that
c22498	she had; and they brought out all her kindred,
c22499	and left them without the camp of Israel.
c22500	And they burnt the city with fire, and all
c22501	that
c22502	<i>was</i> therein: only the silver, and the gold, and the vessels of brass and of iron, they put into the treasury of the house of the LORD.
c22503	Rahab the harlot alive, and her father's household, and all
c22504	that
c22505	And Joshua saved
c22506	she had; and she dwelleth in Israel <i>even</i> unto this day;
c22507	because she hid the messengers,
c22508	which Joshua sent
c22509	to spy out Jericho.
c22510	And Joshua adjured <i>them</i> at that time,
c22511	saying,
c22512	Cursed <i>be</i> the man before the LORD,
c22513	that riseth up
c22514	and buildeth this city Jericho:
c22515	he shall lay the foundation thereof in his firstborn,
c22516	and in his youngest <i>son</i> shall he set up the gates of it.
c22517	So the LORD was with Joshua;
c22518	and his fame was <i>noised</i> throughout all the country.
c22519	But the children of Israel committed a trespass in the accursed thing:
c22520	for Achan, the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, took of the accursed thing:
c22521	and the anger of the LORD was kindled against the children of Israel.
c22522	And Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai,
c22523	which <i>is</i> beside Bethaven, on the east side of Bethel,
c22524	and spake unto
c22525	them, saying,
c22526	Go up
c22527	and view the country.
c22528	And the men went up
c22529	and viewed Ai.
c22530	And they returned to Joshua,
c22531	and said unto
c22532	him, Let not all the people go up;
c22533	but let about two or three thousand men go up
c22534	and smite Ai;
c22535	<i>and</i> make not all the people to labour thither;
c22536	for they <i>are but</i> few.
c22537	So there went up thither of the people about three thousand men:
c22538	and they fled before the men of Ai.
c22539	And the men of Ai smote of them about thirty and six men:
c22540	for they chased them <i>from</i> before the gate <i>even</i> unto Shebarim,
c22541	and smote them in the going down:
c22542	wherefore the hearts of the people melted,
c22543	and became as water.
c22544	And Joshua rent his clothes,
c22545	and fell to the earth upon his face before the ark of the LORD until the eventide, he and the elders of Israel,
c22546	and put dust upon their heads.
c22547	And Joshua said,
c22548	Alas, O Lord GOD,
c22549	wherefore hast thou at all brought this people over Jordan,
c22550	to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites,
c22551	to destroy
c22552	us? would to God we had been content,
c22553	and dwelt on the other side Jordan!
c22554	O Lord,
c22555	what shall I say,
c22556	when Israel turneth their backs before their enemies!
c22557	For the Canaanites and all the inhabitants of the land shall hear
c22558	<i>of it,</i> and shall environ us round,
c22559	and cut off our name from the earth:
c22560	and what wilt thou do unto thy great name?
c22561	And the LORD said unto Joshua,
c22562	Get thee up;
c22563	wherefore liest thou thus upon thy face?
c22564	Israel hath sinned,
c22565	and they have also transgressed my covenant
c22566	which I commanded
c22567	them: for they have even taken of the accursed thing,
c22568	and have also stolen,
c22569	and dissembled also,
c22570	and they have put <i>it</i> even among their own stuff.
c22571	Therefore the children of Israel could not
c22572	stand before their enemies,
c22573	<i>but</i> turned <i>their</i> backs before their enemies,
c22574	because they were accursed:
c22575	neither will I be with you any more,
c22577	except ye destroy the accursed from among you.
c22578	Up,
c22579	sanctify the people,
c22580	and say,
c22581	Sanctify yourselves against to morrow:
c22582	for thus saith the LORD God of Israel,
c22583	<i>There is</i> an accursed thing in the midst
c22584	of thee, O Israel:
c22585	thou canst not
c22586	stand before thine enemies,
c22587	until ye take away the accursed thing from among you.
c22588	In the morning therefore ye shall be brought according to your tribes:
c22589	and it shall be, <i>that</i> the tribe
c22590	which the LORD taketh
c22591	shall come according to the families
c22592	<i>thereof;</i> and the family
c22593	which the LORD shall take
c22594	shall come by households;
c22595	and the household
c22596	which the LORD shall take
c22597	shall come man by man.
c22598	And it shall be,
c22599	<i>that</i> he that is taken with the accursed thing
c22600	shall be burnt with fire,
c22601	he and all
c22602	that
c22603	he hath: because he hath transgressed the covenant of the LORD,
c22604	and because he hath wrought folly in Israel.
c22605	So Joshua rose up early in the morning,
c22606	and brought Israel by their tribes;
c22607	and the tribe of Judah was taken:
c22608	And he brought the family of Judah;
c22609	and he took the family of the Zarhites:
c22610	and he brought the family of the Zarhites man by man;
c22611	and Zabdi was taken:
c22612	And he brought his household man by man;
c22613	and Achan, the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, was taken.
c22614	And Joshua said unto Achan,
c22615	My son,
c22616	give, I pray thee, glory to the LORD God of Israel,
c22617	and make confession
c22618	unto him; and tell me now
c22619	what thou hast done;
c22620	hide <i>it</i> not from me.
c22621	And Achan answered Joshua,
c22622	and said,
c22623	Indeed I have sinned against the LORD God of Israel,
c22624	and thus and thus have I done:
c22625	When I saw among the spoils a goodly Babylonish garment, and two hundred shekels of silver, and a wedge of gold
c22626	of fifty shekels weight,
c22627	then I coveted
c22628	them, and took
c22629	them; and, behold, they <i>are</i> hid in the earth in the midst of my tent,
c22630	and the silver under it.
c22631	So Joshua sent messengers,
c22632	and they ran unto the tent;
c22633	and, behold, <i>it was</i> hid in his tent,
c22634	and the silver under it.
c22635	And they took them out of the midst of the tent,
c22636	and brought them unto Joshua, and unto all the children of Israel,
c22637	and laid them out before the LORD.
c22638	And Joshua, and all Israel with him, took Achan the son of Zerah, and the silver, and the garment, and the wedge of gold, and his sons, and his daughters, and his oxen, and his asses, and his sheep, and his tent,
c22639	that
c22640	and all
c22641	he had: and they brought them unto the valley of Achor.
c22642	And Joshua said,
c22643	Why hast thou troubled
c22644	us? the LORD shall trouble thee this day.
c22645	And all Israel stoned him with stones, and burned them with fire, after they had stoned
c22647	them with stones.
c22648	And they raised over him a great heap of stones unto this day.
c22649	So the LORD turned from the fierceness of his anger.
c22650	Wherefore the name of that place was called, The valley of Achor, unto this day.
c22651	And the LORD said unto Joshua,
c22652	Fear not,
c22653	neither be thou dismayed:
c22654	take all the people of war with
c22655	thee, and arise,
c22656	go up to Ai:
c22657	see,
c22658	I have given into thy hand the king of Ai, and his people, and his city, and his land:
c22659	And thou shalt do to Ai and her king
c22660	as thou didst unto Jericho and her king:
c22661	only the spoil thereof, and the cattle thereof, shall ye take for a prey
c22662	unto yourselves: lay
c22663	thee an ambush for the city
c22664	behind it.
c22665	So Joshua arose, and all the people of war,
c22666	to go up against Ai:
c22667	and Joshua chose out thirty thousand mighty men of valour,
c22668	and sent them away by night.
c22669	And he commanded
c22670	them, saying,
c22671	Behold,
c22672	ye shall lie in wait against the city, <i>even</i> behind the city:
c22673	go not very far from the city,
c22674	but be ye all ready:
c22675	And I, and all the people
c22676	that <i>are</i> with
c22677	me, will approach unto the city:
c22678	and it shall come to pass,
c22679	when they come out
c22680	against
c22681	us, as at the first,
c22682	that we will flee before them,
c22683	(For they will come out after
c22684	us) till we have drawn them from the city;
c22685	for they will say,
c22686	They flee before
c22687	us, as at the first:
c22688	therefore we will flee before them.
c22689	Then ye shall rise up from the ambush,
c22690	and seize upon the city:
c22691	for the LORD your God will deliver it into your hand.
c22692	And it shall be,
c22693	when ye have taken the city,
c22694	<i>that</i> ye shall set the city on fire:
c22695	according to the commandment of the LORD shall ye do.
c22696	See,
c22697	I have commanded you.
c22698	Joshua therefore sent them forth:
c22699	and they went to lie in ambush,
c22700	and abode between Bethel and Ai, on the west side of Ai:
c22701	but Joshua lodged that night among the people.
c22702	And Joshua rose up early in the morning,
c22703	and numbered the people,
c22704	and went up, he and the elders of Israel, before the people to Ai.
c22705	And all the people, <i>even the people</i> of war
c22706	that <i>were</i> with
c22707	him, went up,
c22708	and drew nigh,
c22709	and came before the city,
c22710	and pitched on the north side of Ai:
c22711	now <i>there was</i> a valley between them and Ai.
c22712	And he took about five thousand men,
c22713	and set them to lie in ambush between Bethel and Ai, on the west side of the city.
c22714	And when they had set the people, <i>even</i> all the host
c22715	that <i>was</i> on the north of the city,
c22716	and their liers in wait on the west of the city,
c22717	Joshua went that night into the midst of the valley.
c22718	And it came to pass,
c22719	when the king of Ai saw
c22720	<i>it,</i> that they hasted
c22721	and rose up early,
c22722	and the men of the city went out
c22723	against Israel to battle,
c22724	he and all his people, at a time appointed, before the plain;
c22725	but he wist not
c22726	that <i>there were</i> liers in ambush against him behind the city.
c22727	And Joshua and all Israel made as if they were beaten before
c22728	them, and fled by the way of the wilderness.
c22729	And all the people that
c22730	the city.
c22732	them: and they pursued after Joshua, and were drawn away from
c22733	<i>were</i> in Ai were called together to pursue after
c22734	And there was not a man left in Ai or Bethel,
c22735	that went not out after Israel:
c22736	and they left the city open,
c22737	and pursued after Israel.
c22738	And the LORD said unto Joshua,
c22739	Stretch out the spear
c22740	that <i>is</i> in thy hand
c22741	toward Ai;
c22742	for I will give it into thine hand.
c22743	And Joshua stretched out the spear
c22744	that <i>he had</i> in his hand
c22745	toward the city.
c22746	And the ambush arose quickly out of their place,
c22747	and they ran
c22748	as soon as he had stretched out his hand:
c22749	and they entered into the city,
c22750	and took
c22751	it, and hasted
c22752	and set the city on fire.
c22753	And when the men of Ai looked behind
c22754	them, they saw,
c22755	and, behold, the smoke of the city ascended up to heaven,
c22756	and they had no power
c22757	to flee this way or that way:
c22758	and the people
c22759	that fled to the wilderness
c22760	turned back upon the pursuers.
c22761	And when Joshua and all Israel saw
c22762	that the ambush had taken the city,
c22763	and that the smoke of the city ascended,
c22764	then they turned again,
c22765	and slew the men of Ai.
c22766	And the other issued out of the city
c22767	against
c22768	them; so they were in the midst of Israel,
c22769	some on this side,
c22770	and some on that side:
c22771	and they smote
c22772	them, so that they let none of them remain or escape.
c22773	And the king of Ai they took alive,
c22774	and brought him to Joshua.
c22775	And it came to pass,
c22776	when Israel had made an end
c22777	of slaying all the inhabitants of Ai in the field, in the wilderness
c22778	wherein they chased
c22779	them, and when they were all fallen on the edge of the sword,
c22780	until they were consumed,
c22781	that all the Israelites returned unto Ai,
c22782	and smote it with the edge of the sword.
c22783	And <i>so</i> it was, <i>that</i> all
c22784	that fell that day,
c22785	both of men and women, <i>were</i> twelve thousand, <i>even</i> all the men of Ai.
c22786	For Joshua drew not his hand
c22787	back, wherewith he stretched out the spear,
c22788	until he had utterly destroyed all the inhabitants of Ai.
c22789	Only the cattle and the spoil of that city Israel took for a prey unto themselves, according unto the word of the LORD
c22790	which he commanded Joshua.
c22791	And Joshua burnt Ai,
c22792	and made it an heap for ever, <i>even</i> a desolation unto this day.
c22793	And the king of Ai he hanged on a tree until eventide:
c22795	and as soon as the sun was down,
c22796	Joshua commanded
c22797	that they should take his carcase down from the tree,
c22798	and cast it at the entering of the gate of the city,
c22799	and raise thereon a great heap of stones, <i>that remaineth</i> unto this day.
c22800	Then Joshua built an altar unto the LORD God of Israel in mount Ebal,
c22801	As Moses the servant of the LORD commanded the children of Israel,
c22802	as it is written in the book of the law of Moses,
c22803	an altar of whole stones,
c22804	over which no man hath lift up <i>any</i> iron:
c22805	and they offered thereon burnt offerings unto the LORD,
c22806	and sacrificed peace offerings.
c22807	And he wrote there upon the stones a copy of the law of Moses,
c22808	which he wrote in the presence of the children of Israel.
c22809	And all Israel, and their elders, and officers, and their judges, stood on this side the ark and on that side before the priests the Levites, which bare the ark of the covenant of the LORD, as well the stranger, as he that was born among them;
c22810	half of them over against mount Gerizim,
c22811	and half of them over against mount Ebal;
c22812	as Moses the servant of the LORD had commanded
c22813	that they should bless the people of Israel.
c22814	before,
c22815	And afterward he read all the words of the law, the blessings and cursings, according to all
c22816	that is written in the book of the law.
c22817	There was not a word of all
c22818	that Moses commanded,
c22819	which Joshua read not before all the congregation of Israel, with the women, and the little ones, and the strangers
c22820	that were conversant among them.
c22821	And it came to pass,
c22822	when all the kings which <i>were</i> on this side Jordan, in the hills, and in the valleys, and in all the coasts of the great sea over against Lebanon,
c22824	the Hittite, and the Amorite, the Canaanite, the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite, heard <i>thereof;</i>
c22825	That they gathered themselves together,
c22826	to fight with Joshua and with Israel, with one accord.
c22827	And when the inhabitants of Gibeon heard
c22828	what Joshua had done unto Jericho and to Ai,
c22829	They did work wilily,
c22830	and went
c22831	and made as if they had been ambassadors,
c22832	and took old sacks upon their asses, and wine bottles, old, and rent, and bound up;
c22833	And old shoes and clouted upon their feet,
c22834	and old garments upon
c22835	them; and all the bread of their provision was dry
c22836	<i>and</i> mouldy.
c22837	And they went to Joshua unto the camp at Gilgal,
c22838	and said unto him, and to the men of Israel,
c22839	We be come from a far country:
c22840	now therefore make ye a league with us.
c22841	And the men of Israel said unto the Hivites,
c22842	Peradventure ye dwell among
c22843	us; and how shall we make a league with you?
c22844	And they said unto Joshua,
c22845	We <i>are</i> thy servants.
c22846	And Joshua said unto
c22847	them, Who <i>are</i> ye?
c22848	and from whence come ye?
c22849	And they said unto
c22850	him, From a very far country thy servants are come because of the name of the LORD thy God:
c22851	for we have heard the fame
c22852	of him, and all
c22853	that he did in Egypt,
c22854	And all
c22855	that he did to the two kings of the Amorites,
c22856	that <i>were</i> beyond Jordan,
c22857	to Sihon king of Heshbon, and to Og king of Bashan,
c22858	which <i>was</i> at Ashtaroth.
c22859	Wherefore our elders and all the inhabitants of our country spake to
c22860	us, saying,
c22861	Take victuals with you for the journey,
c22862	and go
c22863	to meet
c22864	them, and say unto
c22865	them, We <i>are</i> your servants:
c22866	therefore now make ye a league with us.
c22867	This our bread
c22868	we took hot <i>for</i> our provision out of our houses on the day
c22869	we came forth
c22870	to go unto
c22871	you; but now, behold, it is dry,
c22872	and it is mouldy:
c22873	And these bottles of wine,
c22874	which we filled,
c22875	<i>were</i> new;
c22876	and, behold, they be rent:
c22877	and these our garments and our shoes
c22878	are become old by reason of the very long journey.
c22879	And the men took of their victuals,
c22880	and asked not <i>counsel</i> at the mouth of the LORD.
c22881	And Joshua made peace
c22882	with them, and made a league
c22883	with them, to let them live:
c22884	and the princes of the congregation sware unto them.
c22885	And it came to pass at the end of three days
c22886	after they had made a league
c22887	with them, that they heard
c22888	that they <i>were</i> their neighbours,
c22889	and <i>that</i> they dwelt among them.
c22890	And the children of Israel journeyed,
c22891	and came unto their cities on the third day.
c22892	Now their cities <i>were</i> Gibeon, and Chephirah, and Beeroth, and Kirjathjearim.
c22893	And the children of Israel smote them not,
c22894	because the princes of the congregation had sworn unto them by the LORD God of Israel.
c22895	And all the congregation murmured against the princes.
c22896	But all the princes said unto all the congregation,
c22897	We have sworn unto them by the LORD God of Israel:
c22898	now therefore we may not
c22899	touch them.
c22900	This we will do
c22901	to them; we will even let them live,
c22902	lest wrath be upon us, because of the oath
c22903	which we sware unto them.
c22904	And the princes said unto
c22905	them, Let them live;
c22906	but let them be hewers of wood and drawers of water unto all the congregation;
c22907	as the princes had promised them.
c22908	And Joshua called
c22909	for them, and he spake unto
c22910	them, saying,
c22911	Wherefore have ye beguiled
c22912	us, saying,
c22913	We <i>are</i> very far from
c22914	you; when ye dwell among us?
c22915	Now therefore ye <i>are</i> cursed,
c22916	and there shall none of you be freed from being bondmen, and hewers of wood and drawers of water for the house of my God.
c22917	And they answered Joshua,
c22918	and said,
c22919	Because it was certainly told thy servants,
c22920	how that the LORD thy God commanded his servant Moses
c22921	to give you all the land,
c22922	and to destroy all the inhabitants of the land from before
c22923	you, therefore we were sore afraid of our lives because of
c22924	you, and have done this thing.
c22925	And now, behold, we <i>are</i> in thine hand:
c22926	as it seemeth good and right unto thee
c22927	to do
c22928	unto us, do.
c22929	And so did
c22930	he unto them, and delivered them out of the hand of the children of Israel,
c22931	that they slew them not.
c22932	And Joshua made them that day hewers of wood and drawers of water for the congregation, and for the altar of the LORD, even unto this day, in the place
c22933	which he should choose.
c22934	Now it came to pass,
c22935	when Adonizedek king of Jerusalem had heard
c22936	how Joshua had taken Ai,
c22937	and had utterly destroyed
c22938	it; as he had done to Jericho and her king,
c22939	so he had done to Ai and her king;
c22940	and how the inhabitants of Gibeon had made peace with Israel,
c22941	and were among them;
c22942	That they feared greatly,
c22943	because Gibeon <i>was</i> a great city, as one of the royal cities,
c22944	and because it <i>was</i> greater than Ai,
c22945	and all the men thereof <i>were</i> mighty.
c22946	Wherefore Adonizedek king of Jerusalem sent unto Hoham king of Hebron, and unto Piram king of Jarmuth, and unto Japhia king of Lachish, and unto Debir king of Eglon,
c22947	saying,
c22948	Come up unto
c22949	me, and help
c22950	me, that we may smite Gibeon:
c22951	for it hath made peace with Joshua and with the children of Israel.
c22953	Therefore the five kings of the Amorites, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, the king of Eglon, gathered themselves together, and went up, they and all their hosts,
c22954	and encamped before Gibeon,
c22955	and made war against it.
c22956	And the men of Gibeon sent unto Joshua to the camp to Gilgal,
c22957	saying,
c22958	Slack not thy hand from thy servants;
c22959	come up to us quickly,
c22960	and save
c22961	us, and help
c22962	us: for all the kings of the Amorites that dwell in the mountains are gathered together against us.
c22963	So Joshua ascended from Gilgal, he, and all the people of war with him, and all the mighty men of valour.
c22964	And the LORD said unto Joshua,
c22965	Fear them not: for I have delivered them into thine hand;
c22967	there shall not a man of them stand before thee.
c22968	Joshua therefore came unto them suddenly,
c22969	<i>and</i> went up from Gilgal all night.
c22970	And the LORD discomfited them before Israel,
c22971	and slew them with a great slaughter at Gibeon,
c22972	and chased them along the way that goeth up to Bethhoron,
c22973	and smote them to Azekah, and unto Makkedah.
c22974	And it came to pass,
c22975	as they fled from before Israel,
c22976	<i>and</i> were in the going down to Bethhoron,
c22977	that the LORD cast down great stones from heaven upon them unto Azekah,
c22978	and they died:
c22979	<i>they were</i> more
c22980	which died with hailstones
c22981	than <i>they</i> whom the children of Israel slew with the sword.
c22982	Then spake Joshua to the LORD in the day
c22983	when the LORD delivered up the Amorites before the children of Israel,
c22984	and he said in the sight of Israel,
c22985	Sun,
c22986	stand thou still upon Gibeon;
c22988	and thou, Moon,
c22989	in the valley of Ajalon.
c22990	And the sun stood still,
c22991	and the moon stayed,
c22992	until the people had avenged themselves upon their enemies.
c22993	<i>Is</i> not this written in the book of Jasher?
c22994	So the sun stood still in the midst of heaven,
c22995	and hasted not
c22996	to go down about a whole day.
c22997	And there was no day like that before it or after
c22998	it, that the LORD hearkened unto the voice of a man:
c22999	for the LORD fought for Israel.
c23000	And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, unto the camp to Gilgal.
c23001	But these five kings fled,
c23002	and hid themselves in a cave at Makkedah.
c23003	And it was told Joshua,
c23004	saying,
c23005	The five kings are found
c23006	hid in a cave at Makkedah.
c23007	And Joshua said,
c23008	Roll great stones upon the mouth of the cave,
c23009	and set men by
c23010	it for to keep them:
c23011	And stay ye not,
c23012	<i>but</i> pursue after your enemies,
c23013	and smite the hindmost
c23014	of them; suffer them not
c23015	to enter into their cities:
c23016	for the LORD your God hath delivered them into your hand.
c23017	And it came to pass,
c23018	when Joshua and the children of Israel had made an end
c23019	of slaying them with a very great slaughter,
c23020	till they were consumed,
c23021	that the rest <i>which</i> remained of
c23022	them entered into fenced cities.
c23023	And all the people returned to the camp to Joshua at Makkedah in peace:
c23024	none moved his tongue against any of the children of Israel.
c23025	Then said Joshua,
c23026	Open the mouth of the cave,
c23027	and bring out those five kings unto me out of the cave.
c23028	And they did so,
c23029	and brought forth those five kings unto him out of the cave, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, <i>and</i> the king of Eglon.
c23030	And it came to pass,
c23031	when they brought out those kings unto Joshua,
c23032	that Joshua called for all the men of Israel,
c23033	and said unto the captains of the men of war
c23034	which went with
c23035	him, Come near,
c23036	put your feet upon the necks of these kings.
c23037	And they came near,
c23038	and put their feet upon the necks of them.
c23039	And Joshua said unto
c23040	them, Fear not,
c23041	nor be dismayed,
c23042	be strong
c23043	and of good courage:
c23044	for thus shall the LORD do to all your enemies
c23045	against whom ye fight.
c23046	And afterward Joshua smote
c23047	them, and slew
c23048	them, and hanged them on five trees:
c23049	and they were
c23050	hanging upon the trees
c23051	until the evening.
c23052	And it came to pass at the time
c23053	of the going down of the sun,
c23054	<i>that</i> Joshua commanded,
c23055	and they took them down off the trees,
c23056	and cast them into the cave
c23057	wherein they had been hid,
c23058	and laid great stones in the cave's mouth, <i>which remain</i> until this very day.
c23059	And that day Joshua took Makkedah,
c23060	and smote it with the edge of the sword,
c23061	and the king thereof he utterly destroyed, them, and all the souls
c23062	that
c23063	<i>were</i> therein; he let none remain:
c23064	and he did to the king of Makkedah
c23065	as he did unto the king of Jericho.
c23066	Then Joshua passed from Makkedah, and all Israel with him, unto Libnah,
c23067	and fought against Libnah:
c23068	And the LORD delivered it also, and the king thereof, into the hand of Israel;
c23069	and he smote it with the edge of the sword,
c23070	and all the souls
c23071	that
c23072	<i>were</i> therein; he let none remain
c23073	in it; but did unto the king
c23074	thereof as he did unto the king of Jericho.
c23075	And Joshua passed from Libnah, and all Israel with him, unto Lachish,
c23076	and encamped against
c23077	it, and fought against it:
c23078	And the LORD delivered Lachish into the hand of Israel,
c23079	which took it on the second day,
c23080	and smote it with the edge of the sword,
c23081	and all the souls
c23082	that
c23083	<i>were</i> therein, according to all
c23084	that he had done to Libnah.
c23085	Then Horam king of Gezer came up
c23086	to help Lachish;
c23087	and Joshua smote
c23088	him and his people,
c23089	until he had left him none remaining.
c23090	And from Lachish Joshua passed unto Eglon, and all Israel with
c23091	him; and they encamped against
c23092	it, and fought against it:
c23093	And they took it on that day,
c23094	and smote it with the edge of the sword,
c23095	and all the souls
c23096	that
c23097	<i>were</i> therein he utterly destroyed that day, according to all
c23098	that he had done to Lachish.
c23099	And Joshua went up from Eglon, and all Israel with him, unto Hebron;
c23100	and they fought against it:
c23101	And they took
c23102	it, and smote it with the edge of the sword,
c23103	and the king thereof, and all the cities thereof, and all the souls
c23104	that
c23105	<i>were</i> therein; he left none remaining, according to all
c23106	that he had done to Eglon;
c23107	but destroyed it utterly, and all the souls
c23108	that <i>were</i> therein.
c23109	And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, to Debir;
c23110	and fought against it:
c23111	And he took
c23112	it, and the king thereof, and all the cities
c23113	thereof; and they smote them with the edge of the sword,
c23114	and utterly destroyed all the souls
c23115	that
c23116	<i>were</i> therein; he left none remaining:
c23117	as he had done to Hebron,
c23118	so he did to Debir, and to the king
c23119	thereof; as he had done also to Libnah, and to her king.
c23120	So Joshua smote all the country of the hills, and of the south, and of the vale, and of the springs, and all their kings:
c23121	he left none remaining,
c23122	but utterly destroyed all that breathed,
c23123	as the LORD God of Israel commanded.
c23124	And Joshua smote them from Kadeshbarnea even unto Gaza,
c23125	and all the country of Goshen, even unto Gibeon.
c23126	And all these kings and their land did Joshua take at one time,
c23127	because the LORD God of Israel fought for Israel.
c23128	And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, unto the camp to Gilgal.
c23129	And it came to pass,
c23130	when Jabin king of Hazor had heard
c23131	<i>those things,</i> that he sent to Jobab king of Madon, and to the king of Shimron, and to the king of Achshaph,
c23132	And to the kings
c23133	that <i>were</i> on the north of the mountains,
c23134	and of the plains south of Chinneroth,
c23135	and in the valley,
c23136	and in the borders of Dor on the west,
c23137	<i>And to</i> the Canaanite on the east and on the west,
c23138	and <i>to</i> the Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Jebusite in the mountains,
c23139	and <i>to</i> the Hivite under Hermon in the land of Mizpeh.
c23140	And they went out, they and all their hosts with them, much people, even as the sand
c23141	that <i>is</i> upon the sea shore
c23142	in multitude,
c23143	with horses and chariots very many.
c23144	And when all these kings were met together,
c23145	they came
c23146	and pitched together at the waters of Merom,
c23147	to fight against Israel.
c23148	And the LORD said unto Joshua,
c23149	Be not afraid because of
c23150	them: for to morrow about this time will I deliver them up all slain before Israel:
c23151	thou shalt hough their horses,
c23152	and burn their chariots with fire.
c23153	So Joshua came, and all the people of war with him, against them by the waters of Merom suddenly;
c23154	and they fell upon them.
c23155	And the LORD delivered them into the hand of Israel,
c23156	who smote
c23157	them, and chased them unto great Zidon, and unto Misrephothmaim, and unto the valley of Mizpeh eastward;
c23158	and they smote
c23159	them, until they left them none remaining.
c23160	And Joshua did
c23161	unto them as the LORD bade
c23162	him: he houghed their horses,
c23163	and burnt their chariots with fire.
c23164	And Joshua at that time turned back,
c23165	and took Hazor,
c23166	and smote the king thereof with the sword:
c23167	for Hazor
c23168	beforetime was the head of all those kingdoms.
c23169	And they smote all the souls
c23170	that
c23171	<i>were</i> therein with the edge of the sword,
c23172	utterly destroying
c23173	<i>them:</i> there was not any left to breathe:
c23174	and he burnt Hazor with fire.
c23175	And all the cities of those kings, and all the kings of them, did Joshua take,
c23176	and smote them with the edge of the sword,
c23177	<i>and</i> he utterly destroyed
c23178	them, as Moses the servant of the LORD commanded.
c23179	But <i>as for</i> the cities
c23180	that stood still in their strength,
c23181	Israel burned none
c23182	of them, save Hazor only; <i>that</i> did Joshua burn.
c23183	And all the spoil of these cities, and the cattle, the children of Israel took for a prey
c23184	unto themselves; but every man they smote with the edge of the sword,
c23185	until they had destroyed
c23186	them, neither left they any to breathe.
c23187	As the LORD commanded Moses his servant,
c23188	so did Moses command Joshua,
c23189	and so did Joshua;
c23190	he left nothing undone of all
c23191	that the LORD commanded Moses.
c23192	So Joshua took all that land, the hills, and all the south country, and all the land of Goshen, and the valley, and the plain, and the mountain of Israel, and the valley of the same;
c23193	<i>Even</i> from the mount Halak,
c23194	that goeth up to Seir,
c23195	even unto Baalgad in the valley of Lebanon under mount Hermon:
c23196	and all their kings he took,
c23197	and smote
c23198	them, and slew them.
c23199	Joshua made war a long time with all those kings.
c23200	There was not a city
c23201	that made peace with the children of Israel,
c23202	save the Hivites the inhabitants of Gibeon:
c23203	all <i>other</i> they took in battle.
c23204	For it was of the LORD
c23205	to harden their hearts,
c23206	that they should come against Israel in battle,
c23207	that he might destroy
c23208	them utterly, <i>and</i> that they might have no favour,
c23209	but that he might destroy
c23210	them, as the LORD commanded Moses.
c23211	And at that time came Joshua,
c23212	and cut off the Anakims from the mountains, from Hebron, from Debir, from Anab, and from all the mountains of Judah, and from all the mountains of Israel:
c23213	Joshua destroyed them utterly with their cities.
c23214	There was none of the Anakims left in the land of the children of Israel:
c23215	only in Gaza, in Gath, and in Ashdod, there remained.
c23216	So Joshua took the whole land, according to all
c23217	that the LORD said unto Moses;
c23218	and Joshua gave it for an inheritance unto Israel according to their divisions by their tribes.
c23219	And the land rested from war.
c23220	Now these <i>are</i> the kings of the land,
c23221	which the children of Israel smote,
c23222	and possessed their land on the other side Jordan toward the rising of the sun, from the river Arnon unto mount Hermon, and all the plain on the east:
c23223	Sihon king of the Amorites,
c23224	who dwelt in Heshbon,
c23225	<i>and</i> ruled from Aroer,
c23226	which <i>is</i> upon the bank of the river Arnon,
c23227	and from the middle of the river, and from half Gilead, even unto the river Jabbok, <i>which is</i> the border of the children of Ammon;
c23228	And from the plain to the sea of Chinneroth on the east, and unto the sea of the plain, <i>even</i> the salt sea on the east, the way to Bethjeshimoth; and from the south, under Ashdothpisgah:
c23229	And the coast of Og king of Bashan, <i>which was</i> of the remnant of the giants,
c23230	that dwelt at Ashtaroth and at Edrei,
c23231	And reigned in mount Hermon, and in Salcah, and in all Bashan, unto the border of the Geshurites and the Maachathites, and half Gilead, the border of Sihon king of Heshbon.
c23232	Them did Moses the servant of the LORD and the children of Israel smite:
c23233	and Moses the servant of the LORD gave it <i>for</i> a possession unto the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and the half tribe of Manasseh.
c23234	And these <i>are</i> the kings of the country
c23235	which Joshua and the children of Israel smote on this side Jordan on the west, from Baalgad in the valley of Lebanon even unto the mount Halak,
c23236	that goeth up to Seir;
c23237	which Joshua gave unto the tribes of Israel <i>for</i> a possession according to their divisions;
c23238	In the mountains, and in the valleys, and in the plains, and in the springs, and in the wilderness, and in the south country; the Hittites, the Amorites, and the Canaanites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites:
c23239	The king of Jericho, one;
c23240	the king of Ai,
c23241	which <i>is</i> beside Bethel,
c23242	one;
c23243	The king of Jerusalem, one;
c23244	the king of Hebron, one;
c23245	The king of Jarmuth, one;
c23246	the king of Lachish, one;
c23247	The king of Eglon, one;
c23248	the king of Gezer, one;
c23249	The king of Debir, one;
c23250	the king of Geder, one;
c23251	The king of Hormah, one;
c23252	the king of Arad, one;
c23253	The king of Libnah, one;
c23254	the king of Adullam, one;
c23255	The king of Makkedah, one;
c23256	the king of Bethel, one;
c23257	The king of Tappuah, one;
c23258	the king of Hepher, one;
c23259	The king of Aphek, one;
c23260	the king of Lasharon, one;
c23261	The king of Madon, one;
c23262	the king of Hazor, one;
c23263	The king of Shimronmeron, one;
c23264	the king of Achshaph, one;
c23265	The king of Taanach, one;
c23266	the king of Megiddo, one;
c23267	The king of Kedesh, one;
c23268	the king of Jokneam of Carmel, one;
c23269	The king of Dor in the coast of Dor, one;
c23270	the king of the nations of Gilgal, one;
c23271	The king of Tirzah, one:
c23272	all the kings thirty and one.
c23273	Now Joshua was old
c23274	<i>and</i> stricken in years;
c23275	and the LORD said unto
c23276	him, Thou art old
c23277	<i>and</i> stricken in years,
c23278	and there remaineth yet very much land
c23279	to be possessed.
c23280	This <i>is</i> the land
c23281	that yet remaineth:
c23282	all the borders of the Philistines, and all Geshuri,
c23283	From Sihor,
c23284	which <i>is</i> before Egypt,
c23285	even unto the borders of Ekron northward, <i>which</i> is counted to the Canaanite: five lords of the Philistines; the Gazathites, and the Ashdothites, the Eshkalonites, the Gittites, and the Ekronites; also the Avites:
c23286	From the south, all the land of the Canaanites, and Mearah
c23287	that <i>is</i> beside the Sidonians,
c23288	unto Aphek, to the borders of the Amorites:
c23289	And the land of the Giblites, and all Lebanon, toward the sunrising, from Baalgad under mount Hermon
c23290	unto the entering into Hamath.
c23291	All the inhabitants of the hill country from Lebanon unto Misrephothmaim, <i>and</i> all the Sidonians,
c23292	them will I drive out from before the children of Israel:
c23293	only divide thou it by lot unto the Israelites for an inheritance,
c23294	as I have commanded thee.
c23295	Now therefore divide this land for an inheritance unto the nine tribes, and the half tribe of Manasseh,
c23296	With whom the Reubenites and the Gadites have received their inheritance,
c23297	which Moses gave
c23298	them, beyond Jordan eastward,
c23299	<i>even</i> as Moses the servant of the LORD gave them;
c23300	From Aroer,
c23301	that <i>is</i> upon the bank of the river Arnon,
c23302	and the city
c23303	that <i>is</i> in the midst of the river,
c23304	and all the plain of Medeba unto Dibon;
c23305	And all the cities of Sihon king of the Amorites,
c23306	which reigned in Heshbon,
c23307	unto the border of the children of Ammon;
c23308	And Gilead, and the border of the Geshurites and Maachathites, and all mount Hermon, and all Bashan unto Salcah;
c23309	All the kingdom of Og in Bashan,
c23310	which reigned in Ashtaroth and in Edrei,
c23311	who remained of the remnant of the giants:
c23312	for these did Moses smite,
c23313	and cast them out.
c23314	Nevertheless the children of Israel expelled not the Geshurites, nor the Maachathites:
c23315	but the Geshurites and the Maachathites dwell among the Israelites until this day.
c23316	Only unto the tribe of Levi he gave none inheritance;
c23317	the sacrifices of the LORD God of Israel made by fire
c23318	<i>are</i> their inheritance,
c23319	as he said unto them.
c23320	And Moses gave unto the tribe of the children of Reuben <i>inheritance</i> according to their families.
c23321	And their coast was from Aroer,
c23322	that <i>is</i> on the bank of the river Arnon,
c23323	and the city
c23324	that <i>is</i> in the midst of the river,
c23325	and all the plain by Medeba;
c23326	Heshbon, and all her cities
c23327	that <i>are</i> in the plain;
c23328	Dibon, and Bamothbaal, and Bethbaalmeon,
c23329	And Jahazah, and Kedemoth, and Mephaath,
c23330	And Kirjathaim, and Sibmah, and Zarethshahar in the mount of the valley,
c23331	And Bethpeor, and Ashdothpisgah, and Bethjeshimoth,
c23332	And all the cities of the plain, and all the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites,
c23333	which reigned in Heshbon,
c23334	whom Moses smote with the princes of Midian, Evi, and Rekem, and Zur, and Hur, and Reba, <i>which were</i> dukes of Sihon, dwelling in the country.
c23335	Balaam also the son of Beor, the soothsayer, did the children of Israel slay with the sword among them that were slain by them.
c23336	And the border of the children of Reuben was Jordan, and the border
c23337	<i>thereof.</i> This <i>was</i> the inheritance of the children of Reuben after their families, the cities and the villages thereof.
c23338	And Moses gave <i>inheritance</i> unto the tribe of Gad, <i>even</i> unto the children of Gad according to their families.
c23339	And their coast was Jazer, and all the cities of Gilead, and half the land of the children of Ammon, unto Aroer
c23340	that <i>is</i> before Rabbah;
c23341	And from Heshbon unto Ramathmizpeh, and Betonim;
c23342	and from Mahanaim unto the border of Debir;
c23343	And in the valley, Betharam, and Bethnimrah, and Succoth, and Zaphon, the rest of the kingdom of Sihon king of Heshbon, Jordan and <i>his</i> border, <i>even</i> unto the edge of the sea of Chinnereth on the other side Jordan eastward.
c23344	This <i>is</i> the inheritance of the children of Gad after their families, the cities, and their villages.
c23345	And Moses gave <i>inheritance</i> unto the half tribe of Manasseh:
c23346	and <i>this</i> was <i>the possession</i> of the half tribe of the children of Manasseh by their families.
c23347	And their coast was from Mahanaim, all Bashan, all the kingdom of Og king of Bashan, and all the towns of Jair,
c23348	which <i>are</i> in Bashan,
c23349	threescore cities:
c23350	And half Gilead, and Ashtaroth, and Edrei, cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan, <i>were pertaining</i> unto the children of Machir the son of Manasseh,
c23351	<i>even</i> to the one half of the children of Machir by their families.
c23352	These
c23353	<i>are the countries</i> which Moses did distribute for inheritance in the plains of Moab, on the other side Jordan, by Jericho, eastward.
c23354	But unto the tribe of Levi Moses gave not <i>any</i> inheritance:
c23355	the LORD God of Israel
c23356	<i>was</i> their inheritance,
c23357	as he said unto them.
c23358	And these
c23359	<i>are the countries</i> which the children of Israel inherited in the land of Canaan,
c23360	which Eleazar the priest, and Joshua the son of Nun, and the heads of the fathers of the tribes of the children of Israel, distributed for inheritance to them.
c23361	By lot <i>was</i> their inheritance,
c23362	as the LORD commanded by the hand of Moses,
c23363	for the nine tribes, and <i>for</i> the half tribe.
c23364	For Moses had given the inheritance of two tribes and an half tribe on the other side Jordan:
c23365	but unto the Levites he gave none inheritance among them.
c23366	For the children of Joseph were two tribes, Manasseh and Ephraim:
c23367	therefore they gave no part unto the Levites in the land,
c23368	save cities
c23369	to dwell
c23370	<i>in,</i> with their suburbs for their cattle and for their substance.
c23371	As the LORD commanded Moses,
c23372	so the children of Israel did,
c23373	and they divided the land.
c23374	Then the children of Judah came unto Joshua in Gilgal:
c23375	and Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenezite said unto
c23376	him, Thou knowest the thing
c23377	that the LORD said unto Moses the man of God concerning me and thee in Kadeshbarnea.
c23378	Forty years old <i>was</i> I
c23379	when Moses the servant of the LORD sent me from Kadeshbarnea
c23380	to espy out the land;
c23381	and I brought him word
c23382	again as <i>it was</i> in mine heart.
c23383	Nevertheless my brethren
c23384	that went up with
c23385	me made the heart of the people melt:
c23386	but I wholly followed the LORD my God.
c23387	And Moses sware on that day,
c23388	saying,
c23389	Surely the land
c23390	whereon thy feet have trodden
c23391	shall be thine inheritance,
c23392	and thy children's for ever,
c23393	because thou hast wholly followed the LORD my God.
c23394	And now,
c23395	behold, the LORD hath kept me alive,
c23396	as he said,
c23397	these forty and five years,
c23398	even since the LORD spake this word unto Moses,
c23399	while <i>the children of</i> Israel wandered in the wilderness:
c23400	and now,
c23401	lo, I <i>am</i> this day fourscore and five years old.
c23402	As yet I <i>am as</i> strong this day
c23403	as <i>I was</i> in the day
c23404	that Moses sent
c23405	me: as my strength <i>was</i> then,
c23406	even so <i>is</i> my strength now, for war,
c23407	both to go out,
c23408	and to come in.
c23409	Now
c23410	therefore give me this mountain,
c23411	whereof the LORD spake in that day;
c23412	for thou heardest in that day
c23413	how the Anakims <i>were</i> there,
c23414	and <i>that</i> the cities <i>were</i> great <i>and</i> fenced:
c23415	if so be the LORD <i>will be</i> with
c23416	me, then I shall be able to drive them out,
c23417	as the LORD said.
c23418	And Joshua blessed
c23419	him, and gave unto Caleb the son of Jephunneh Hebron for an inheritance.
c23420	Hebron therefore became the inheritance of Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenezite unto this day,
c23421	because that he wholly followed the LORD God of Israel.
c23422	And the name of Hebron before <i>was</i> Kirjatharba;
c23423	<i>which Arba was</i> a great man among the Anakims.
c23424	And the land had rest from war.
c23425	<i>This</i> then was the lot of the tribe of the children of Judah by their families; <i>even</i> to the border of Edom the wilderness of Zin southward <i>was</i> the uttermost part of the south coast.
c23426	And their south border was from the shore of the salt sea, from the bay
c23427	that looketh southward:
c23428	And it went out to the south side to Maalehacrabbim,
c23429	and passed along to Zin,
c23430	and ascended up on the south side unto Kadeshbarnea,
c23431	and passed along to Hezron,
c23432	and went up to Adar,
c23433	and fetched a compass to Karkaa:
c23434	<i>From thence</i> it passed toward Azmon,
c23435	and went out unto the river of Egypt;
c23436	and the goings out of that coast were at the sea:
c23437	this shall be your south coast.
c23438	And the east border <i>was</i> the salt sea, <i>even</i> unto the end of Jordan.
c23439	And <i>their</i> border in the north quarter <i>was</i> from the bay of the sea at the uttermost part of Jordan:
c23440	And the border went up to Bethhogla,
c23441	and passed along by the north of Betharabah;
c23442	and the border went up to the stone of Bohan the son of Reuben:
c23443	And the border went up toward Debir from the valley of Achor,
c23444	and so northward, looking toward Gilgal,
c23445	that <i>is</i> before the going up to Adummim,
c23446	which <i>is</i> on the south side of the river:
c23447	and the border passed toward the waters of Enshemesh,
c23448	and the goings out thereof were at Enrogel:
c23449	And the border went up by the valley of the son of Hinnom unto the south side of the Jebusite;
c23450	the same <i>is</i> Jerusalem:
c23451	and the border went up to the top of the mountain
c23452	that <i>lieth</i> before the valley of Hinnom westward,
c23453	which <i>is</i> at the end of the valley of the giants northward:
c23454	And the border was drawn from the top of the hill unto the fountain of the water of Nephtoah,
c23455	and went out to the cities of mount Ephron;
c23456	and the border was drawn to Baalah,
c23457	which <i>is</i> Kirjathjearim:
c23458	And the border compassed from Baalah westward unto mount Seir,
c23459	and passed along unto the side of mount Jearim, which <i>is</i> Chesalon, on the north side,
c23461	and went down to Bethshemesh,
c23462	and passed on to Timnah:
c23463	And the border went out unto the side of Ekron northward:
c23464	and the border was drawn to Shicron,
c23465	and passed along to mount Baalah,
c23466	and went out unto Jabneel;
c23467	and the goings out of the border were at the sea.
c23468	And the west border <i>was</i> to the great sea,
c23469	and the coast
c23470	<i>thereof.</i> This <i>is</i> the coast of the children of Judah round about according to their families.
c23471	And unto Caleb the son of Jephunneh he gave a part among the children of Judah, according to the commandment of the LORD to Joshua, <i>even</i> the city of Arba the father of Anak,
c23472	which <i>city is</i> Hebron.
c23473	And Caleb drove thence the three sons of Anak, Sheshai, and Ahiman, and Talmai, the children of Anak.
c23474	And he went up thence to the inhabitants of Debir:
c23475	and the name of Debir before <i>was</i> Kirjathsepher.
c23476	And Caleb said,
c23477	He that smiteth Kirjathsepher,
c23478	and taketh
c23479	it, to him will I give Achsah my daughter to wife.
c23480	And Othniel the son of Kenaz, the brother of Caleb, took
c23481	it: and he gave him Achsah his daughter to wife.
c23482	And it came to pass,
c23483	as she came
c23484	<i>unto him,</i> that she moved
c23485	him to ask of her father a field:
c23486	and she lighted off <i>her</i> ass;
c23487	and Caleb said
c23488	unto her, What wouldest thou?
c23489	Who answered,
c23490	Give me a blessing;
c23491	for thou hast given me a south land;
c23492	give me also springs of water.
c23493	And he gave her the upper springs, and the nether springs.
c23494	This <i>is</i> the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Judah according to their families.
c23495	And the uttermost cities of the tribe of the children of Judah toward the coast of Edom southward were Kabzeel, and Eder, and Jagur,
c23496	And Kinah, and Dimonah, and Adadah,
c23497	And Kedesh, and Hazor, and Ithnan,
c23498	Ziph, and Telem, and Bealoth,
c23499	And Hazor, Hadattah, and Kerioth, <i>and</i> Hezron,
c23500	which <i>is</i> Hazor,
c23501	Amam, and Shema, and Moladah,
c23502	And Hazargaddah, and Heshmon, and Bethpalet,
c23503	And Hazarshual, and Beersheba, and Bizjothjah,
c23504	Baalah, and Iim, and Azem,
c23505	And Eltolad, and Chesil, and Hormah,
c23506	And Ziklag, and Madmannah, and Sansannah,
c23507	And Lebaoth, and Shilhim, and Ain, and Rimmon:
c23508	all the cities <i>are</i> twenty and nine, with their villages:
c23509	<i>And</i> in the valley, Eshtaol, and Zoreah, and Ashnah,
c23510	And Zanoah, and Engannim, Tappuah, and Enam,
c23511	Jarmuth, and Adullam, Socoh, and Azekah,
c23512	And Sharaim, and Adithaim, and Gederah, and Gederothaim; fourteen cities with their villages:
c23513	Zenan, and Hadashah, and Migdalgad,
c23514	And Dilean, and Mizpeh, and Joktheel,
c23515	Lachish, and Bozkath, and Eglon,
c23516	And Cabbon, and Lahmam, and Kithlish,
c23517	And Gederoth, Bethdagon, and Naamah, and Makkedah; sixteen cities with their villages:
c23518	Libnah, and Ether, and Ashan,
c23519	And Jiphtah, and Ashnah, and Nezib,
c23520	And Keilah, and Achzib, and Mareshah; nine cities with their villages:
c23521	Ekron, with her towns and her villages:
c23522	From Ekron even unto the sea, all
c23523	that <i>lay</i> near Ashdod, with their villages:
c23524	Ashdod with her towns and her villages,
c23525	Gaza with her towns and her villages, unto the river of Egypt, and the great sea, and the border <i>thereof:</i>
c23526	And in the mountains, Shamir, and Jattir, and Socoh,
c23527	And Dannah, and Kirjathsannah,
c23528	which <i>is</i> Debir,
c23529	And Anab, and Eshtemoh, and Anim,
c23530	And Goshen, and Holon, and Giloh; eleven cities with their villages:
c23531	Arab, and Dumah, and Eshean,
c23532	And Janum, and Bethtappuah, and Aphekah,
c23533	And Humtah, and Kirjatharba,
c23534	which <i>is</i> Hebron,
c23535	and Zior; nine cities with their villages:
c23536	Maon, Carmel, and Ziph, and Juttah,
c23537	And Jezreel, and Jokdeam, and Zanoah,
c23538	Cain, Gibeah, and Timnah; ten cities with their villages:
c23539	Halhul, Bethzur, and Gedor,
c23540	And Maarath, and Bethanoth, and Eltekon; six cities with their villages:
c23541	Kirjathbaal,
c23542	which <i>is</i> Kirjathjearim,
c23543	and Rabbah; two cities with their villages:
c23544	In the wilderness, Betharabah, Middin, and Secacah,
c23545	And Nibshan, and the city of Salt, and Engedi; six cities with their villages.
c23546	As for the Jebusites the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the children of Judah could not drive them out:
c23548	but the Jebusites dwell with the children of Judah at Jerusalem unto this day.
c23549	And the lot of the children of Joseph fell from Jordan by Jericho, unto the water of Jericho on the east, to the wilderness
c23550	that goeth up from Jericho throughout mount Bethel,
c23551	And goeth out from Bethel to Luz,
c23552	and passeth along unto the borders of Archi to Ataroth,
c23553	And goeth down westward to the coast of Japhleti, unto the coast of Bethhoron the nether, and to Gezer:
c23554	and the goings out thereof are at the sea.
c23555	So the children of Joseph, Manasseh and Ephraim, took their inheritance.
c23556	And the border of the children of Ephraim according to their families was
c23557	<i>thus:</i> even the border of their inheritance on the east side was Atarothaddar, unto Bethhoron the upper;
c23558	And the border went out toward the sea to Michmethah on the north side;
c23559	and the border went about eastward unto Taanathshiloh,
c23560	and passed by it on the east to Janohah;
c23561	And it went down from Janohah to Ataroth,
c23562	and to Naarath,
c23563	and came to Jericho,
c23564	and went out at Jordan.
c23565	The border went out from Tappuah westward unto the river Kanah;
c23566	and the goings out thereof were at the sea.
c23567	This <i>is</i> the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Ephraim by their families.
c23568	And the separate cities for the children of Ephraim <i>were</i> among the inheritance of the children of Manasseh, all the cities with their villages.
c23569	And they drave not out the Canaanites
c23570	that dwelt in Gezer:
c23571	but the Canaanites dwell among the Ephraimites unto this day,
c23572	and serve under tribute.
c23573	There was also a lot for the tribe of Manasseh;
c23574	for he <i>was</i> the firstborn of Joseph;
c23575	<i>to wit,</i> for Machir the firstborn of Manasseh, the father of Gilead:
c23576	because he was a man of war,
c23577	therefore he had Gilead and Bashan.
c23578	There was also <i>a lot</i> for the rest of the children of Manasseh by their families; for the children of Abiezer, and for the children of Helek, and for the children of Asriel, and for the children of Shechem, and for the children of Hepher, and for the children of Shemida:
c23579	these <i>were</i> the male children of Manasseh the son of Joseph by their families.
c23580	But Zelophehad, the son of Hepher, the son of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh,
c23581	had no sons,
c23582	but daughters:
c23583	and these <i>are</i> the names of his daughters,
c23584	Mahlah, and Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah.
c23585	And they came near before Eleazar the priest, and before Joshua the son of Nun, and before the princes,
c23586	saying,
c23587	The LORD commanded Moses
c23588	to give us an inheritance among our brethren.
c23589	Therefore according to the commandment of the LORD he gave them an inheritance among the brethren of their father.
c23590	And there fell ten portions to Manasseh, beside the land of Gilead and Bashan,
c23591	which <i>were</i> on the other side Jordan;
c23592	Because the daughters of Manasseh had an inheritance among his sons:
c23593	and the rest of Manasseh's sons had the land of Gilead.
c23594	And the coast of Manasseh was from Asher to Michmethah,
c23595	that <i>lieth</i> before Shechem;
c23596	and the border went along on the right hand unto the inhabitants of Entappuah.
c23597	<i>Now</i> Manasseh had the land of Tappuah:
c23598	but Tappuah on the border of Manasseh <i>belonged</i> to the children of Ephraim;
c23599	And the coast descended unto the river Kanah, southward of the river:
c23600	these cities of Ephraim <i>are</i> among the cities of Manasseh:
c23601	the coast of Manasseh also <i>was</i> on the north side of the river,
c23602	and the outgoings of it were at the sea:
c23603	Southward <i>it was</i> Ephraim's,
c23604	and northward <i>it was</i> Manasseh's,
c23605	and the sea is his border;
c23606	and they met together in Asher on the north,
c23607	and in Issachar on the east.
c23608	And Manasseh had in Issachar and in Asher Bethshean and her towns, and Ibleam and her towns, and the inhabitants of Dor and her towns, and the inhabitants of Endor and her towns, and the inhabitants of Taanach and her towns, and the inhabitants of Megiddo and her towns, <i>even</i> three countries.
c23609	Yet the children of Manasseh could not
c23610	drive out <i>the inhabitants of</i> those cities;
c23611	but the Canaanites would
c23612	dwell in that land.
c23613	Yet it came to pass,
c23614	when the children of Israel were waxen strong,
c23615	that they put the Canaanites to tribute;
c23616	but did not utterly drive them out.
c23617	And the children of Joseph spake unto Joshua,
c23618	saying,
c23619	Why hast thou given me <i>but</i> one lot and one portion to inherit,
c23620	seeing I <i>am</i> a great people,
c23621	forasmuch as the LORD hath blessed me hitherto?
c23622	And Joshua answered
c23623	them, If thou <i>be</i> a great people,
c23624	<i>then</i> get thee up to the wood
c23625	<i>country,</i> and cut down for thyself there in the land of the Perizzites and of the giants,
c23626	if mount Ephraim be too narrow for thee.
c23627	And the children of Joseph said,
c23628	The hill is not enough
c23629	for us: and all the Canaanites that dwell in the land of the valley have chariots of iron,
c23631	<i>both they</i> who <i>are</i> of Bethshean and her towns,
c23632	and <i>they</i> who <i>are</i> of the valley of Jezreel.
c23633	And Joshua spake unto the house of Joseph, <i>even</i> to Ephraim and to Manasseh,
c23634	saying,
c23635	Thou <i>art</i> a great people,
c23636	and hast great power:
c23637	thou shalt not have one lot <i>only:</i>
c23638	But the mountain shall be
c23639	thine; for it <i>is</i> a wood,
c23640	and thou shalt cut it down:
c23641	and the outgoings of it shall be
c23642	thine: for thou shalt drive out the Canaanites,
c23643	though they have iron chariots,
c23644	<i>and</i> though they <i>be</i> strong.
c23645	And the whole congregation of the children of Israel assembled together at Shiloh,
c23646	and set up the tabernacle of the congregation there.
c23647	And the land was subdued before them.
c23648	And there remained among the children of Israel
c23649	which had not yet received their inheritance.
c23650	seven tribes,
c23651	And Joshua said unto the children of Israel,
c23652	How long <i>are</i> ye slack
c23653	to go
c23654	to possess the land,
c23655	which the LORD God of your fathers hath given you?
c23656	Give out from among you three men for <i>each</i> tribe:
c23657	and I will send
c23658	them, and they shall rise,
c23659	and go through the land,
c23660	and describe it according to the inheritance
c23661	of them; and they shall come <i>again</i> to me.
c23662	And they shall divide it into seven parts:
c23663	Judah shall abide in their coast on the south,
c23664	and the house of Joseph shall abide in their coasts on the north.
c23665	Ye shall therefore describe the land <i>into</i> seven parts,
c23666	and bring <i>the description</i> hither to
c23667	me, that I may cast lots for you here before the LORD our God.
c23668	But the Levites have no part among
c23669	you; for the priesthood of the LORD <i>is</i> their inheritance:
c23670	and Gad, and Reuben, and half the tribe of Manasseh, have received their inheritance beyond Jordan on the east,
c23671	which Moses the servant of the LORD gave them.
c23672	And the men arose,
c23673	and went away:
c23674	and Joshua charged them that went
c23675	to describe the land,
c23676	saying,
c23677	Go
c23678	and walk through the land,
c23679	and describe
c23680	it, and come again to
c23681	me, that I may here cast lots for you before the LORD in Shiloh.
c23682	And the men went
c23683	and passed through the land,
c23684	and described it by cities into seven parts in a book,
c23685	and came <i>again</i> to Joshua to the host at Shiloh.
c23686	And Joshua cast lots for them in Shiloh before the LORD:
c23687	and there Joshua divided the land unto the children of Israel according to their divisions.
c23688	And the lot of the tribe of the children of Benjamin came up according to their families:
c23689	and the coast of their lot came forth between the children of Judah and the children of Joseph.
c23690	And their border on the north side was from Jordan;
c23691	and the border went up to the side of Jericho on the north side,
c23692	and went up through the mountains westward;
c23693	and the goings out thereof were at the wilderness of Bethaven.
c23694	And the border went over from thence toward Luz, to the side of Luz, which <i>is</i> Bethel, southward;
c23696	and the border descended to Atarothadar, near the hill
c23697	that <i>lieth</i> on the south side of the nether Bethhoron.
c23698	And the border was drawn
c23699	<i>thence,</i> and compassed the corner of the sea southward, from the hill
c23700	that <i>lieth</i> before Bethhoron southward;
c23701	and the goings out thereof were at Kirjathbaal,
c23702	which <i>is</i> Kirjathjearim, a city of the children of Judah:
c23703	this <i>was</i> the west quarter.
c23704	And the south quarter <i>was</i> from the end of Kirjathjearim,
c23705	and the border went out on the west,
c23706	and went out to the well of waters of Nephtoah:
c23707	And the border came down to the end of the mountain
c23708	that <i>lieth</i> before the valley of the son of Hinnom,
c23709	<i>and</i> which <i>is</i> in the valley of the giants on the north,
c23710	and descended to the valley of Hinnom, to the side of Jebusi on the south,
c23711	and descended to Enrogel,
c23712	And was drawn from the north,
c23713	and went forth to Enshemesh,
c23714	and went forth toward Geliloth,
c23715	which <i>is</i> over against the going up of Adummim,
c23716	and descended to the stone of Bohan the son of Reuben,
c23717	And passed along toward the side over against Arabah northward,
c23718	and went down unto Arabah:
c23719	And the border passed along to the side of Bethhoglah northward:
c23720	and the outgoings of the border were at the north bay of the salt sea at the south end of Jordan:
c23721	this <i>was</i> the south coast.
c23722	And Jordan was the border of it on the east side.
c23723	This <i>was</i> the inheritance of the children of Benjamin, by the coasts thereof round about, according to their families.
c23724	Now the cities of the tribe of the children of Benjamin according to their families were Jericho, and Bethhoglah, and the valley of Keziz,
c23725	And Betharabah, and Zemaraim, and Bethel,
c23726	And Avim, and Parah, and Ophrah,
c23727	And Chepharhaammonai, and Ophni, and Gaba; twelve cities with their villages:
c23728	Gibeon, and Ramah, and Beeroth,
c23729	And Mizpeh, and Chephirah, and Mozah,
c23730	And Rekem, and Irpeel, and Taralah,
c23731	And Zelah, Eleph, and Jebusi,
c23732	which <i>is</i> Jerusalem,
c23733	Gibeath, <i>and</i> Kirjath; fourteen cities with their villages.
c23734	This <i>is</i> the inheritance of the children of Benjamin according to their families.
c23735	And the second lot came forth to Simeon, <i>even</i> for the tribe of the children of Simeon according to their families:
c23736	and their inheritance was within the inheritance of the children of Judah.
c23737	And they had in their inheritance Beersheba, or Sheba, and Moladah,
c23738	And Hazarshual, and Balah, and Azem,
c23739	And Eltolad, and Bethul, and Hormah,
c23740	And Ziklag, and Bethmarcaboth, and Hazarsusah,
c23741	And Bethlebaoth, and Sharuhen; thirteen cities and their villages:
c23742	Ain, Remmon, and Ether, and Ashan; four cities and their villages:
c23743	And all the villages
c23744	that <i>were</i> round about these cities
c23745	to Baalathbeer, Ramath of the south.
c23746	This <i>is</i> the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Simeon according to their families.
c23747	Out of the portion of the children of Judah <i>was</i> the inheritance of the children of Simeon:
c23748	for the part of the children of Judah was too much for them:
c23749	therefore the children of Simeon had their inheritance within the inheritance of them.
c23750	And the third lot came up for the children of Zebulun according to their families:
c23751	and the border of their inheritance was unto Sarid:
c23752	And their border went up toward the sea, and Maralah,
c23753	and reached to Dabbasheth,
c23754	and reached to the river
c23755	that <i>is</i> before Jokneam;
c23756	And turned from Sarid eastward toward the sunrising unto the border of Chislothtabor,
c23757	and then goeth out to Daberath,
c23758	and goeth up to Japhia,
c23759	And from thence passeth on along on the east to Gittahhepher, to Ittahkazin,
c23760	and goeth out to Remmonmethoar
c23761	to Neah;
c23762	And the border compasseth it on the north side to Hannathon:
c23763	and the outgoings thereof are in the valley of Jiphthahel:
c23764	And Kattath, and Nahallal, and Shimron, and Idalah, and Bethlehem: twelve cities with their villages.
c23765	This <i>is</i> the inheritance of the children of Zebulun according to their families, these cities with their villages.
c23766	<i>And</i> the fourth lot came out to Issachar, for the children of Issachar according to their families.
c23767	And their border was toward Jezreel, and Chesulloth, and Shunem,
c23768	And Hapharaim, and Shion, and Anaharath,
c23769	And Rabbith, and Kishion, and Abez,
c23770	And Remeth, and Engannim, and Enhaddah, and Bethpazzez;
c23771	And the coast reacheth to Tabor, and Shahazimah, and Bethshemesh;
c23772	and the outgoings of their border were at Jordan: sixteen cities with their villages.
c23773	This <i>is</i> the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Issachar according to their families, the cities and their villages.
c23774	And the fifth lot came out for the tribe of the children of Asher according to their families.
c23775	And their border was Helkath, and Hali, and Beten, and Achshaph,
c23776	And Alammelech, and Amad, and Misheal;
c23777	and reacheth to Carmel westward,
c23778	and to Shihorlibnath;
c23779	And turneth toward the sunrising to Bethdagon,
c23780	and reacheth to Zebulun, and to the valley of Jiphthahel toward the north side of Bethemek, and Neiel,
c23781	and goeth out to Cabul on the left hand,
c23782	And Hebron, and Rehob, and Hammon, and Kanah, <i>even</i> unto great Zidon;
c23783	And <i>then</i> the coast turneth to Ramah, and to the strong city Tyre;
c23784	and the coast turneth to Hosah;
c23785	and the outgoings thereof are at the sea from the coast to Achzib:
c23786	Ummah also, and Aphek, and Rehob: twenty and two cities with their villages.
c23787	This <i>is</i> the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Asher according to their families, these cities with their villages.
c23788	The sixth lot came out to the children of Naphtali, <i>even</i> for the children of Naphtali according to their families.
c23789	And their coast was from Heleph, from Allon to Zaanannim, and Adami, Nekeb, and Jabneel, unto Lakum;
c23790	and the outgoings thereof were at Jordan:
c23791	And <i>then</i> the coast turneth westward to Aznothtabor,
c23792	and goeth out from thence to Hukkok,
c23793	and reacheth to Zebulun on the south side, and reacheth to Asher on the west side,
c23795	and to Judah upon Jordan toward the sunrising.
c23796	And the fenced cities <i>are</i> Ziddim, Zer, and Hammath, Rakkath, and Chinnereth,
c23797	And Adamah, and Ramah, and Hazor,
c23798	And Kedesh, and Edrei, and Enhazor,
c23799	And Iron, and Migdalel, Horem, and Bethanath, and Bethshemesh; nineteen cities with their villages.
c23800	This <i>is</i> the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Naphtali according to their families, the cities and their villages.
c23801	<i>And</i> the seventh lot came out for the tribe of the children of Dan according to their families.
c23802	And the coast of their inheritance was Zorah, and Eshtaol, and Irshemesh,
c23803	And Shaalabbin, and Ajalon, and Jethlah,
c23804	And Elon, and Thimnathah, and Ekron,
c23805	And Eltekeh, and Gibbethon, and Baalath,
c23806	And Jehud, and Beneberak, and Gathrimmon,
c23807	And Mejarkon, and Rakkon, with the border before Japho.
c23808	And the coast of the children of Dan went out <i>too little</i> for them:
c23809	therefore the children of Dan went up
c23810	to fight against Leshem,
c23811	and took
c23812	it, and smote it with the edge of the sword,
c23813	and possessed
c23814	it, and dwelt
c23815	therein, and called Leshem, Dan, after the name of Dan their father.
c23816	This <i>is</i> the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Dan according to their families, these cities with their villages.
c23817	When they had made an end
c23818	of dividing the land for inheritance by their coasts,
c23819	the children of Israel gave an inheritance to Joshua the son of Nun among them:
c23820	According to the word of the LORD they gave him the city
c23821	which he asked,
c23822	<i>even</i> Timnathserah in mount Ephraim:
c23823	and he built the city,
c23824	and dwelt therein.
c23825	These <i>are</i> the inheritances,
c23826	which Eleazar the priest, and Joshua the son of Nun, and the heads of the fathers of the tribes of the children of Israel, divided for an inheritance by lot in Shiloh before the LORD, at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.
c23827	So they made an end
c23828	of dividing the country.
c23829	The LORD also spake unto Joshua,
c23830	saying,
c23831	Speak to the children of Israel,
c23832	saying,
c23833	Appoint out for you cities of refuge,
c23834	whereof I spake unto you by the hand of Moses:
c23835	That the slayer that killeth <i>any</i> person unawares <i>and</i> unwittingly may flee thither:
c23836	and they shall be your refuge from the avenger of blood.
c23837	And when he that doth flee unto one of those cities
c23838	shall stand at the entering of the gate of the city,
c23839	and shall declare his cause in the ears of the elders of that city,
c23840	they shall take him into the city
c23841	unto them, and give him a place,
c23842	that he may dwell among them.
c23843	And if the avenger of blood pursue after
c23844	him, then they shall not deliver the slayer up into his hand;
c23845	because he smote his neighbour unwittingly,
c23846	and hated him not beforetime.
c23847	And he shall dwell in that city,
c23848	until he stand before the congregation for judgment,
c23849	<i>and</i> until the death of the high priest
c23850	that shall be in those days:
c23851	then shall the slayer return,
c23852	and come unto his own city, and unto his own house, unto the city
c23853	from whence he fled.
c23854	And they appointed Kedesh in Galilee in mount Naphtali, and Shechem in mount Ephraim, and Kirjatharba,
c23855	which <i>is</i> Hebron,
c23856	in the mountain of Judah.
c23857	And on the other side Jordan by Jericho eastward, they assigned Bezer in the wilderness upon the plain out of the tribe of Reuben,
c23858	and Ramoth in Gilead out of the tribe of Gad,
c23859	and Golan in Bashan out of the tribe of Manasseh.
c23860	These were the cities appointed for all the children of Israel, and for the stranger
c23861	that sojourneth among
c23862	them, that whosoever killeth <i>any</i> person at unawares might flee thither,
c23863	and not die by the hand of the avenger of blood,
c23864	until he stood before the congregation.
c23865	Then came near the heads of the fathers of the Levites unto Eleazar the priest, and unto Joshua the son of Nun, and unto the heads of the fathers of the tribes of the children of Israel;
c23866	And they spake unto them at Shiloh in the land of Canaan,
c23867	saying,
c23868	The LORD commanded by the hand of Moses
c23869	to give us cities
c23870	to dwell
c23871	in, with the suburbs thereof for our cattle.
c23872	And the children of Israel gave unto the Levites out of their inheritance, at the commandment of the LORD, these cities and their suburbs.
c23873	And the lot came out for the families of the Kohathites:
c23874	and the children of Aaron the priest, <i>which were</i> of the Levites, had by lot out of the tribe of Judah, and out of the tribe of Simeon, and out of the tribe of Benjamin, thirteen cities.
c23875	And the rest of the children of Kohath <i>had</i> by lot out of the families of the tribe of Ephraim, and out of the tribe of Dan, and out of the half tribe of Manasseh, ten cities.
c23876	And the children of Gershon <i>had</i> by lot out of the families of the tribe of Issachar, and out of the tribe of Asher, and out of the tribe of Naphtali, and out of the half tribe of Manasseh in Bashan, thirteen cities.
c23877	The children of Merari by their families <i>had</i> out of the tribe of Reuben, and out of the tribe of Gad, and out of the tribe of Zebulun, twelve cities.
c23878	And the children of Israel gave by lot unto the Levites these cities with their suburbs,
c23879	as the LORD commanded by the hand of Moses.
c23881	And they gave out of the tribe of the children of Judah, and out of the tribe of the children of Simeon, these cities
c23882	which are <i>here</i> mentioned by name,
c23883	Which the children of Aaron, <i>being</i> of the families of the Kohathites, <i>who were</i> of the children of Levi, had:
c23884	for theirs was the first lot.
c23885	And they gave them the city of Arba the father of Anak,
c23886	which <i>city is</i> Hebron, in the hill <i>country</i> of Judah,
c23887	with the suburbs thereof round about it.
c23888	But the fields of the city, and the villages thereof, gave they to Caleb the son of Jephunneh for his possession.
c23889	Thus they gave to the children of Aaron the priest Hebron with her suburbs, <i>to be</i> a city of refuge for the slayer;
c23890	and Libnah with her suburbs,
c23891	And Jattir with her suburbs, and Eshtemoa with her suburbs,
c23892	And Holon with her suburbs, and Debir with her suburbs,
c23893	And Ain with her suburbs, and Juttah with her suburbs, <i>and</i> Bethshemesh with her suburbs; nine cities out of those two tribes.
c23894	And out of the tribe of Benjamin, Gibeon with her suburbs, Geba with her suburbs,
c23895	Anathoth with her suburbs, and Almon with her suburbs; four cities.
c23896	All the cities of the children of Aaron, the priests, <i>were</i> thirteen cities with their suburbs.
c23897	And the families of the children of Kohath,
c23898	the Levites which remained of the children of Kohath,
c23899	even they had the cities of their lot out of the tribe of Ephraim.
c23900	For they gave them Shechem with her suburbs in mount Ephraim, <i>to be</i> a city of refuge for the slayer;
c23901	and Gezer with her suburbs,
c23902	And Kibzaim with her suburbs, and Bethhoron with her suburbs; four cities.
c23903	And out of the tribe of Dan, Eltekeh with her suburbs, Gibbethon with her suburbs,
c23904	Aijalon with her suburbs, Gathrimmon with her suburbs; four cities.
c23905	And out of the half tribe of Manasseh, Tanach with her suburbs, and Gathrimmon with her suburbs; two cities.
c23906	All the cities <i>were</i> ten with their suburbs for the families of the children of Kohath that remained.
c23907	And unto the children of Gershon, of the families of the Levites, out of the <i>other</i> half tribe of Manasseh <i>they gave</i> Golan in Bashan with her suburbs, <i>to be</i> a city of refuge for the slayer;
c23908	and Beeshterah with her suburbs; two cities.
c23909	And out of the tribe of Issachar, Kishon with her suburbs, Dabareh with her suburbs,
c23910	Jarmuth with her suburbs, Engannim with her suburbs; four cities.
c23911	And out of the tribe of Asher, Mishal with her suburbs, Abdon with her suburbs,
c23912	Helkath with her suburbs, and Rehob with her suburbs; four cities.
c23913	And out of the tribe of Naphtali, Kedesh in Galilee with her suburbs, <i>to be</i> a city of refuge for the slayer;
c23914	and Hammothdor with her suburbs, and Kartan with her suburbs; three cities.
c23915	All the cities of the Gershonites according to their families <i>were</i> thirteen cities with their suburbs.
c23916	And unto the families of the children of Merari, the rest of the Levites, out of the tribe of Zebulun, Jokneam with her suburbs, and Kartah with her suburbs,
c23917	Dimnah with her suburbs, Nahalal with her suburbs; four cities.
c23918	And out of the tribe of Reuben, Bezer with her suburbs, and Jahazah with her suburbs,
c23919	Kedemoth with her suburbs, and Mephaath with her suburbs; four cities.
c23920	And out of the tribe of Gad, Ramoth in Gilead with her suburbs, <i>to be</i> a city of refuge for the slayer;
c23921	and Mahanaim with her suburbs,
c23922	Heshbon with her suburbs, Jazer with her suburbs; four cities in all.
c23923	So all the cities for the children of Merari by their families,
c23924	which were remaining of the families of the Levites,
c23925	were <i>by</i> their lot twelve cities.
c23926	All the cities of the Levites within the possession of the children of Israel <i>were</i> forty and eight cities with their suburbs.
c23927	These cities were every one
c23928	with their suburbs round about
c23929	them: thus <i>were</i> all these cities.
c23930	And the LORD gave unto Israel all the land
c23931	which he sware
c23932	to give unto their fathers;
c23933	and they possessed
c23934	it, and dwelt therein.
c23935	And the LORD gave them rest round about, according to all
c23936	that he sware unto their fathers:
c23937	and there stood not a man of all their enemies before
c23938	them; the LORD delivered all their enemies into their hand.
c23939	There failed not ought of any good thing
c23940	which the LORD had spoken unto the house of Israel;
c23941	all came to pass.
c23942	Then Joshua called the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and the half tribe of Manasseh,
c23943	And said unto
c23944	them, Ye have kept all
c23945	that Moses the servant of the LORD commanded
c23946	you, and have obeyed my voice in all
c23947	that I commanded you:
c23948	Ye have not left your brethren these many days unto this day,
c23949	but have kept the charge of the commandment of the LORD your God.
c23950	And now the LORD your God hath given rest unto your brethren,
c23951	as he promised
c23952	them: therefore now
c23953	return
c23954	ye, and get you unto your tents, <i>and</i> unto the land of your possession,
c23955	which Moses the servant of the LORD gave you on the other side Jordan.
c23956	But take diligent heed
c23957	to do the commandment and the law,
c23958	which Moses the servant of the LORD charged
c23959	you, to love the LORD your God,
c23960	and to walk in all his ways,
c23961	and to keep his commandments,
c23962	and to cleave
c23963	unto him, and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul.
c23964	So Joshua blessed
c23965	them, and sent them away:
c23966	and they went unto their tents.
c23967	Now to the <i>one</i> half of the tribe of Manasseh Moses had given <i>possession</i> in Bashan:
c23968	but unto the <i>other</i> half thereof gave Joshua among their brethren on this side Jordan westward.
c23969	And when Joshua sent them away also unto their tents,
c23970	then he blessed them,
c23971	And he spake unto
c23972	them, saying,
c23973	Return with much riches unto your tents, and with very much cattle, with silver, and with gold, and with brass, and with iron, and with very much raiment:
c23974	divide the spoil of your enemies with your brethren.
c23976	And the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half tribe of Manasseh returned, and departed from the children of Israel out of Shiloh,
c23977	which <i>is</i> in the land of Canaan,
c23978	to go unto the country of Gilead, to the land of their possession,
c23979	whereof they were possessed, according to the word of the LORD by the hand of Moses.
c23980	And when they came unto the borders of Jordan,
c23981	that <i>are</i> in the land of Canaan,
c23982	the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half tribe of Manasseh built there an altar by Jordan,
c23983	a great altar to see to.
c23984	And the children of Israel heard
c23985	say,
c23986	Behold, the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half tribe of Manasseh have built an altar over against the land of Canaan, in the borders of Jordan, at the passage of the children of Israel.
c23987	And when the children of Israel heard
c23988	<i>of it,</i> the whole congregation of the children of Israel gathered themselves together at Shiloh,
c23989	to go up to war against them.
c23990	And the children of Israel sent unto the children of Reuben, and to the children of Gad, and to the half tribe of Manasseh, into the land of Gilead, Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest,
c23991	And with him ten princes,
c23992	of each chief house a prince throughout all the tribes of Israel;
c23993	and each one
c23994	<i>was</i> an head of the house of their fathers among the thousands of Israel.
c23995	And they came unto the children of Reuben, and to the children of Gad, and to the half tribe of Manasseh, unto the land of Gilead,
c23996	and they spake with
c23997	them, saying,
c23998	Thus saith the whole congregation of the LORD,
c23999	What trespass <i>is</i> this that ye have committed
c24000	against the God of Israel,
c24001	to turn away this day from following the LORD,
c24002	in that ye have builded you an altar,
c24003	that ye might rebel this day against the LORD?
c24004	<i>Is</i> the iniquity of Peor too little
c24005	for us, from which we are not cleansed until this day,
c24006	although there was a plague in the congregation of the LORD,
c24007	But that ye must turn away this day from following the LORD?
c24008	and it will be,
c24009	<i>seeing</i> ye rebel to day against the LORD,
c24010	that to morrow he will be wroth with the whole congregation of Israel.
c24011	Notwithstanding, if the land of your possession <i>be</i> unclean,
c24012	<i>then</i> pass ye over unto the land of the possession of the LORD,
c24013	wherein the LORD'S tabernacle dwelleth,
c24014	and take possession among
c24015	us: but rebel not against the LORD,
c24016	nor rebel
c24017	against us, in building you an altar beside the altar of the LORD our God.
c24018	Did not Achan the son of Zerah commit a trespass in the accursed thing,
c24019	and wrath fell on all the congregation of Israel?
c24020	and that man perished not alone
c24021	in his iniquity.
c24022	Then the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half tribe of Manasseh answered,
c24023	and said unto the heads of the thousands of Israel,
c24024	The LORD God of gods, the LORD God of gods,
c24025	he knoweth,
c24026	and Israel
c24027	he shall know;
c24028	if <i>it be</i> in rebellion,
c24029	or if in transgression against the LORD,
c24030	(save us not this day,)
c24031	That we have built us an altar
c24032	to turn from following the LORD,
c24033	or if to offer thereon burnt offering or meat offering,
c24034	or if to offer peace offerings thereon,
c24035	let the LORD
c24036	himself require <i>it;</i>
c24037	And if we have not <i>rather</i> done it for fear of <i>this</i> thing,
c24038	saying,
c24039	In time to come your children might speak unto our children,
c24040	saying,
c24041	What have ye to do with the LORD God of Israel?
c24042	For the LORD hath made Jordan a border between
c24043	us and you, ye children of Reuben and children of Gad;
c24045	ye have no part in the LORD:
c24046	so shall your children make our children cease
c24047	from fearing the LORD.
c24048	Therefore we said,
c24049	Let us now prepare
c24050	to build us an altar,
c24051	not for burnt
c24052	offering, nor for sacrifice:
c24053	But <i>that</i> it <i>may be</i> a witness between us, and you, and our generations after
c24054	us, that we might do the service of the LORD before him with our burnt offerings, and with our sacrifices, and with our peace offerings;
c24055	that your children may not say to our children in time to come,
c24056	Ye have no part in the LORD.
c24057	Therefore said
c24058	we, that it shall be,
c24059	when they should <i>so</i> say to us or to our generations in time to come,
c24060	that we may say
c24061	<i>again,</i> Behold the pattern of the altar of the LORD,
c24062	which our fathers made,
c24063	not for burnt offerings,
c24064	nor for sacrifices;
c24065	but it <i>is</i> a witness between us and you.
c24066	God forbid that we
c24067	should rebel against the LORD,
c24068	and turn this day from following the LORD,
c24069	to build an altar for burnt offerings, for meat offerings, or for sacrifices, beside the altar of the LORD our God
c24070	that <i>is</i> before his tabernacle.
c24071	And when Phinehas the priest, and the princes of the congregation and heads of the thousands of Israel which <i>were</i> with him, heard
c24073	the words
c24074	that the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the children of Manasseh spake,
c24075	it pleased them.
c24076	And Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest said unto the children of Reuben, and to the children of Gad, and to the children of Manasseh,
c24077	This day we perceive
c24078	that the LORD <i>is</i> among
c24079	us, because ye have not committed this trespass against the LORD:
c24080	now ye have delivered the children of Israel out of the hand of the LORD.
c24081	And Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, and the princes, returned from the children of Reuben, and from the children of Gad, out of the land of Gilead, unto the land of Canaan, to the children of Israel,
c24082	and brought them word again.
c24083	And the thing pleased the children of Israel;
c24084	and the children of Israel blessed God,
c24085	and did not intend
c24086	to go up against them in battle,
c24087	to destroy the land
c24088	wherein the children of Reuben and Gad dwelt.
c24089	And the children of Reuben and the children of Gad called the altar
c24090	<i>Ed:</i> for it <i>shall be</i> a witness between
c24091	us that the LORD <i>is</i> God.
c24092	And it came to pass a long time
c24093	after that the LORD had given rest unto Israel from all their enemies round about,
c24094	that Joshua waxed old
c24095	<i>and</i> stricken in age.
c24096	And Joshua called for all Israel, <i>and</i> for their elders, and for their heads, and for their judges, and for their officers,
c24097	and said unto
c24098	them, I am old
c24099	<i>and</i> stricken in age:
c24100	And ye have seen all
c24101	that the LORD your God hath done unto all these nations because
c24102	of you; for the LORD your God
c24103	<i>is</i> he
c24104	that hath fought for you.
c24105	Behold,
c24106	I have divided unto you by lot these nations that remain, to be an inheritance for your tribes, from Jordan,
c24107	with all the nations
c24108	that I have cut off,
c24109	even unto the great sea westward.
c24110	And the LORD your God,
c24111	he shall expel them from before
c24112	you, and drive them from out of your sight;
c24113	and ye shall possess their land,
c24114	as the LORD your God hath promised unto you.
c24115	Be ye therefore very courageous
c24116	to keep
c24117	and to do all
c24118	that is written in the book of the law of Moses,
c24119	that ye turn not aside therefrom <i>to</i> the right hand or <i>to</i> the left;
c24120	That ye come not among these nations, these that remain
c24121	among you; neither make mention of the name of their gods,
c24122	nor cause to swear
c24123	<i>by them,</i> neither serve
c24124	them, nor bow yourselves unto them:
c24125	But cleave unto the LORD your God,
c24126	as ye have done unto this day.
c24127	For the LORD hath driven out from before you great nations and strong:
c24128	but <i>as for</i> you,
c24129	no man hath been able to stand before you unto this day.
c24130	One man of you shall chase a thousand:
c24131	for the LORD your God,
c24132	he
c24133	<i>it is</i> that fighteth
c24134	for you, as he hath promised you.
c24135	Take good heed therefore unto yourselves,
c24136	that ye love the LORD your God.
c24137	Else
c24138	if ye do in any wise go back,
c24139	and cleave unto the remnant of these nations, <i>even</i> these that remain among
c24140	you, and shall make marriages
c24141	with them, and go in
c24142	unto them, and they to you:
c24143	Know for a certainty
c24144	that the LORD your God will no more
c24145	drive out <i>any of</i> these nations from before
c24146	you; but they shall be snares and traps unto you, and scourges in your sides, and thorns in your eyes,
c24147	until ye perish from off this good land
c24148	which the LORD your God hath given you.
c24149	And, behold,
c24150	this day I <i>am</i> going the way of all the earth:
c24151	and ye know in all your hearts and in all your souls,
c24152	that not one thing hath failed of all the good things
c24153	which the LORD your God spake concerning
c24154	you; all are come to pass
c24155	unto you, <i>and</i> not one thing hath failed thereof.
c24156	Therefore it shall come to pass,
c24157	<i>that</i> as all good things are come upon
c24158	you, which the LORD your God promised
c24159	you; so shall the LORD bring upon you all evil things,
c24160	until he have destroyed you from off this good land
c24161	which the LORD your God hath given you.
c24162	When ye have transgressed the covenant of the LORD your God,
c24163	which he commanded
c24164	you, and have gone
c24165	and served other gods,
c24166	and bowed yourselves
c24167	to them; then shall the anger of the LORD be kindled
c24168	against you, and ye shall perish quickly from off the good land
c24169	which he hath given unto you.
c24170	And Joshua gathered all the tribes of Israel to Shechem,
c24171	and called for the elders of Israel, and for their heads, and for their judges, and for their officers;
c24172	and they presented themselves before God.
c24173	And Joshua said unto all the people,
c24174	Thus saith the LORD God of Israel,
c24175	Your fathers dwelt on the other side of the flood in old time, <i>even</i> Terah, the father of Abraham, and the father of Nachor:
c24176	and they served other gods.
c24177	And I took your father Abraham from the other side of the flood,
c24178	and led him throughout all the land of Canaan,
c24179	and multiplied his seed,
c24180	and gave him Isaac.
c24181	And I gave unto Isaac Jacob and Esau:
c24182	and I gave unto Esau mount Seir,
c24183	to possess
c24184	it; but Jacob and his children went down into Egypt.
c24185	I sent Moses also and Aaron,
c24186	and I plagued Egypt,
c24187	according to that which I did among
c24188	them: and afterward I brought you out.
c24189	And I brought your fathers out of Egypt:
c24190	and ye came unto the sea;
c24191	and the Egyptians pursued after your fathers with chariots and horsemen unto the Red sea.
c24192	And when they cried unto the LORD,
c24193	he put darkness between you and the Egyptians,
c24194	and brought the sea upon
c24195	them, and covered
c24196	them; and your eyes have seen
c24197	what I have done in Egypt:
c24198	and ye dwelt in the wilderness a long season.
c24199	And I brought you into the land of the Amorites,
c24200	which dwelt on the other side Jordan;
c24201	and they fought with
c24202	you: and I gave them into your hand,
c24203	that ye might possess their land;
c24204	and I destroyed them from before you.
c24205	Then Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, arose
c24206	and warred against Israel,
c24207	and sent
c24208	and called Balaam the son of Beor
c24209	to curse you:
c24210	But I would not
c24211	hearken unto Balaam;
c24212	therefore he blessed
c24213	you still: so I delivered you out of his hand.
c24214	And ye went over Jordan,
c24215	and came unto Jericho:
c24216	and the men of Jericho fought against you, the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Girgashites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites;
c24217	and I delivered them into your hand.
c24218	And I sent the hornet before
c24219	you, which drave them out from before you, <i>even</i> the two kings of the Amorites;
c24220	<i>but</i> not with thy sword,
c24221	nor with thy bow.
c24222	And I have given you a land
c24223	for which ye did not labour,
c24224	and cities
c24225	which ye built not,
c24226	and ye dwell
c24227	in them; of the vineyards and oliveyards
c24228	which ye planted not
c24229	do ye eat.
c24230	Now therefore
c24231	fear the LORD,
c24232	and serve him in sincerity and in truth:
c24233	and put away the gods
c24234	which your fathers served on the other side of the flood, and in Egypt;
c24235	and serve ye the LORD.
c24236	And if it seem evil unto you
c24237	to serve the LORD,
c24238	choose you this day
c24239	whom ye will serve;
c24240	whether the gods
c24241	which your fathers served
c24242	that <i>were</i> on the other side of the flood,
c24243	or the gods of the Amorites,
c24244	in whose land ye dwell:
c24245	but as for me and my house, we will serve the LORD.
c24246	And the people answered
c24247	and said,
c24248	God forbid
c24249	that we should forsake the LORD,
c24250	to serve other gods;
c24251	For the LORD our God,
c24252	he
c24253	<i>it is</i> that brought us up and our fathers out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage,
c24254	and which did those great signs in our sight,
c24255	and preserved us in all the way
c24256	wherein we went,
c24257	and among all the people
c24258	through whom we passed:
c24259	And the LORD drave out from before us all the people, even the Amorites
c24260	which dwelt in the land:
c24262	<i>therefore</i> will we also serve the LORD;
c24263	for he <i>is</i> our God.
c24264	And Joshua said unto the people,
c24265	Ye cannot
c24266	serve the LORD:
c24267	for he <i>is</i> an holy God;
c24268	he <i>is</i> a jealous God;
c24269	he will not forgive your transgressions nor your sins.
c24270	If ye forsake the LORD,
c24271	and serve strange gods,
c24272	then he will turn
c24273	and do you hurt,
c24274	and consume
c24275	you, after that he hath done you good.
c24276	And the people said unto Joshua,
c24277	Nay;
c24278	but we will serve the LORD.
c24279	And Joshua said unto the people,
c24280	Ye <i>are</i> witnesses
c24281	against yourselves that ye have chosen you the LORD,
c24282	to serve
c24283	him. And they said,
c24284	<i>We are</i> witnesses.
c24285	Now
c24286	therefore put away, <i>said he,</i> the strange gods
c24287	which <i>are</i> among
c24288	you, and incline your heart unto the LORD God of Israel.
c24289	And the people said unto Joshua,
c24290	The LORD our God will we serve,
c24291	and his voice will we obey.
c24292	So Joshua made a covenant with the people that day,
c24293	and set them a statute and an ordinance in Shechem.
c24294	And Joshua wrote these words in the book of the law of God,
c24295	and took a great stone,
c24296	and set it up there under an oak,
c24297	that <i>was</i> by the sanctuary of the LORD.
c24298	And Joshua said unto all the people,
c24299	Behold, this stone shall be a witness
c24300	unto us; for it hath heard all the words of the LORD
c24301	which he spake unto
c24302	us: it shall be therefore a witness
c24303	unto you, lest ye deny your God.
c24304	So Joshua let the people depart, every man unto his inheritance.
c24305	And it came to pass after these things,
c24306	that Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of the LORD, died, <i>being</i> an hundred and ten years old.
c24307	And they buried him in the border of his inheritance in Timnathserah,
c24308	which <i>is</i> in mount Ephraim, on the north side of the hill of Gaash.
c24309	And Israel served the LORD all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders
c24310	that overlived Joshua,
c24311	and which had known all the works of the LORD,
c24312	that he had done for Israel.
c24313	And the bones of Joseph,
c24314	which the children of Israel brought up out of Egypt,
c24315	buried they in Shechem, in a parcel of ground
c24316	which Jacob bought of the sons of Hamor the father of Shechem for an hundred pieces of silver:
c24317	and it became the inheritance of the children of Joseph.
c24318	And Eleazar the son of Aaron died;
c24319	and they buried him in a hill <i>that pertained to</i> Phinehas his son,
c24320	which was given him in mount Ephraim.
c24321	Now after the death of Joshua it came to pass,
c24322	that the children of Israel asked the LORD,
c24323	saying,
c24324	Who shall go up for us against the Canaanites first,
c24325	to fight against them?
c24326	And the LORD said,
c24327	Judah shall go up:
c24328	behold, I have delivered the land into his hand.
c24329	And Judah said unto Simeon his brother,
c24330	Come up with me into my lot,
c24331	that we may fight against the Canaanites;
c24332	and I likewise will go with thee into thy lot.
c24333	So Simeon went with him.
c24334	And Judah went up;
c24335	and the LORD delivered the Canaanites and the Perizzites into their hand:
c24336	and they slew of them in Bezek ten thousand men.
c24337	And they found Adonibezek in Bezek:
c24338	and they fought
c24339	against him, and they slew the Canaanites and the Perizzites.
c24340	But Adonibezek fled;
c24341	and they pursued after
c24342	him, and caught
c24343	him, and cut off his thumbs and his great toes.
c24344	And Adonibezek said,
c24345	Threescore and ten kings,
c24346	having their thumbs and their great toes cut off,
c24347	gathered <i>their meat</i> under my table:
c24348	as I have done,
c24349	so God hath requited
c24350	me. And they brought him to Jerusalem,
c24351	and there he died.
c24352	Now the children of Judah had fought against Jerusalem,
c24353	and had taken
c24354	it, and smitten it with the edge of the sword,
c24355	and set the city on fire.
c24356	And afterward the children of Judah went down
c24357	to fight against the Canaanites,
c24358	that dwelt in the mountain, and in the south, and in the valley.
c24359	And Judah went against the Canaanites
c24360	that dwelt in Hebron:
c24361	(now the name of Hebron before <i>was</i> Kirjatharba:)
c24362	and they slew Sheshai, and Ahiman, and Talmai.
c24363	And from thence he went against the inhabitants of Debir:
c24364	and the name of Debir before <i>was</i> Kirjathsepher:
c24365	And Caleb said,
c24366	He that smiteth Kirjathsepher,
c24367	and taketh
c24368	it, to him will I give Achsah my daughter to wife.
c24369	And Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother, took
c24371	it: and he gave him Achsah his daughter to wife.
c24372	And it came to pass,
c24373	when she came
c24374	<i>to him,</i> that she moved
c24375	him to ask of her father a field:
c24376	and she lighted from off <i>her</i> ass;
c24377	and Caleb said
c24378	unto her, What wilt thou?
c24379	And she said
c24380	unto him, Give me a blessing:
c24381	for thou hast given me a south land;
c24382	give me also springs of water.
c24383	And Caleb gave her the upper springs and the nether springs.
c24384	And the children of the Kenite, Moses' father in law, went up out of the city of palm trees with the children of Judah into the wilderness of Judah,
c24385	which <i>lieth</i> in the south of Arad;
c24386	and they went
c24387	and dwelt among the people.
c24388	And Judah went with Simeon his brother,
c24389	and they slew the Canaanites
c24390	that inhabited Zephath,
c24391	and utterly destroyed
c24392	it. And the name of the city was called Hormah.
c24393	Also Judah took Gaza with the coast thereof, and Askelon with the coast thereof, and Ekron with the coast thereof.
c24394	And the LORD was with Judah;
c24395	and he drave out <i>the inhabitants of</i> the mountain;
c24396	but could not drive out the inhabitants of the valley,
c24397	because they had chariots of iron.
c24398	And they gave Hebron unto Caleb,
c24399	as Moses said:
c24400	and he expelled thence the three sons of Anak.
c24401	the Jebusites
c24402	that inhabited Jerusalem;
c24403	And the children of Benjamin did not drive out
c24404	but the Jebusites dwell with the children of Benjamin in Jerusalem unto this day.
c24405	And the house of Joseph, they also went up against Bethel:
c24406	and the LORD <i>was</i> with them.
c24407	And the house of Joseph sent to descry Bethel.
c24408	(Now the name of the city before <i>was</i> Luz.)
c24409	And the spies saw
c24410	a man come forth out of the city,
c24411	and they said
c24412	unto him, Shew us, we pray thee, the entrance into the city,
c24413	and we will shew thee mercy.
c24414	And when he shewed them the entrance into the city,
c24415	they smote the city with the edge of the sword;
c24416	but they let go the man and all his family.
c24417	And the man went into the land of the Hittites,
c24418	and built a city,
c24419	and called the name thereof Luz:
c24420	which <i>is</i> the name thereof unto this day.
c24421	Neither did Manasseh drive out <i>the inhabitants of</i> Bethshean and her towns, nor Taanach and her towns, nor the inhabitants of Dor and her towns, nor the inhabitants of Ibleam and her towns, nor the inhabitants of Megiddo and her towns:
c24422	but the Canaanites would
c24423	dwell in that land.
c24424	And it came to pass,
c24425	when Israel was strong,
c24426	that they put the Canaanites to tribute,
c24427	and did not utterly drive them out.
c24428	Neither did Ephraim drive out the Canaanites
c24429	that dwelt in Gezer;
c24430	but the Canaanites dwelt in Gezer among them.
c24431	Neither did Zebulun drive out the inhabitants of Kitron, nor the inhabitants of Nahalol;
c24432	but the Canaanites dwelt among
c24433	them, and became tributaries.
c24434	Neither did Asher drive out the inhabitants of Accho, nor the inhabitants of Zidon, nor of Ahlab, nor of Achzib, nor of Helbah, nor of Aphik, nor of Rehob:
c24435	But the Asherites dwelt among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land:
c24436	for they did not drive them out.
c24437	Neither did Naphtali drive out the inhabitants of Bethshemesh, nor the inhabitants of Bethanath;
c24438	but he dwelt among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land:
c24439	nevertheless the inhabitants of Bethshemesh and of Bethanath became tributaries unto them.
c24440	And the Amorites forced the children of Dan into the mountain:
c24441	for they would not suffer
c24442	them to come down to the valley:
c24443	But the Amorites would
c24444	dwell in mount Heres in Aijalon, and in Shaalbim:
c24445	yet the hand of the house of Joseph prevailed,
c24446	so that they became tributaries.
c24447	And the coast of the Amorites <i>was</i> from the going up to Akrabbim, from the rock, and upward.
c24448	And an angel of the LORD came up from Gilgal to Bochim,
c24449	and said,
c24450	I made you to go up out of Egypt,
c24451	and have brought you unto the land
c24452	which I sware unto your fathers;
c24453	and I said,
c24454	I will never break my covenant with you.
c24455	And ye
c24456	shall make no league with the inhabitants of this land;
c24457	ye shall throw down their altars:
c24458	but ye have not obeyed my voice:
c24459	why have ye done this?
c24460	Wherefore I also said,
c24461	I will not drive them out from before
c24462	you; but they shall be <i>as thorns</i> in your sides,
c24463	and their gods shall be a snare unto you.
c24464	And it came to pass,
c24465	when the angel of the LORD spake these words unto all the children of Israel,
c24466	that the people lifted up their voice,
c24467	and wept.
c24468	And they called the name of that place Bochim:
c24469	and they sacrificed there unto the LORD.
c24470	And when Joshua had let the people go,
c24471	the children of Israel went
c24472	every man unto his inheritance
c24473	to possess the land.
c24474	And the people served the LORD all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders
c24475	that outlived Joshua,
c24476	who had seen all the great works of the LORD,
c24477	that he did for Israel.
c24478	And Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of the LORD, died, <i>being</i> an hundred and ten years old.
c24479	And they buried him in the border of his inheritance in Timnathheres, in the mount of Ephraim, on the north side of the hill Gaash.
c24480	And also all that generation were gathered unto their fathers:
c24481	and there arose another generation after
c24482	them, which knew not the LORD,
c24483	nor yet the works
c24484	which he had done for Israel.
c24485	And the children of Israel did
c24486	evil in the sight of the LORD,
c24487	and served Baalim:
c24488	And they forsook the LORD God of their fathers,
c24489	which brought them out of the land of Egypt,
c24490	and followed other gods, of the gods of the people
c24491	that <i>were</i> round about
c24492	them, and bowed themselves
c24493	unto them, and provoked the LORD to anger.
c24494	And they forsook the LORD,
c24495	and served Baal and Ashtaroth.
c24496	And the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel,
c24497	and he delivered them into the hands of spoilers
c24498	that spoiled
c24499	them, and he sold them into the hands of their enemies round about,
c24500	so that they could not any longer
c24501	stand before their enemies.
c24502	Whithersoever
c24503	they went out,
c24504	the hand of the LORD was against them for evil,
c24505	as the LORD had said,
c24506	and as the LORD had sworn
c24507	unto them: and they were greatly distressed.
c24508	Nevertheless the LORD raised up judges,
c24509	which delivered them out of the hand of those that spoiled them.
c24510	And yet they would not hearken unto their judges,
c24511	but they went a whoring after other gods,
c24512	and bowed themselves
c24513	unto them: they turned quickly out of the way
c24514	which their fathers walked
c24515	in, obeying the commandments of the LORD;
c24516	<i>but</i> they did not so.
c24517	And when the LORD raised them up judges,
c24518	then the LORD was with the judge,
c24519	and delivered them out of the hand of their enemies all the days of the judge:
c24520	for it repented the LORD because of their groanings by reason of them that oppressed them and vexed them.
c24521	And it came to pass, when the judge was dead,
c24522	<i>that</i> they returned,
c24523	and corrupted <i>themselves</i> more than their fathers,
c24524	in following other gods
c24525	to serve
c24526	them, and to bow down
c24527	unto them; they ceased not from their own doings, nor from their stubborn way.
c24528	And the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel;
c24529	and he said,
c24530	Because that this people hath transgressed my covenant
c24531	which I commanded their fathers,
c24532	and have not hearkened unto my voice;
c24533	I also will not henceforth
c24534	drive out any from before them of the nations
c24535	which Joshua left
c24536	when he died:
c24537	That through them I may prove Israel,
c24538	whether they will keep the way of the LORD
c24539	to walk
c24540	therein, as their fathers did keep
c24541	<i>it,</i> or not.
c24542	Therefore the LORD left those nations,
c24543	without driving them out hastily;
c24544	neither delivered he them into the hand of Joshua.
c24545	Now these <i>are</i> the nations
c24546	which the LORD left,
c24547	to prove Israel by them, <i>even</i> as many
c24548	<i>of Israel</i> as had not known all the wars of Canaan;
c24549	Only that the generations of the children of Israel might know,
c24550	to teach them war,
c24551	at the least such as before knew nothing thereof;
c24552	<i>Namely,</i> five lords of the Philistines, and all the Canaanites, and the Sidonians, and the Hivites
c24553	that dwelt in mount Lebanon, from mount Baalhermon
c24554	unto the entering in of Hamath.
c24555	And they were
c24556	to prove Israel
c24557	by them, to know
c24558	whether they would hearken unto the commandments of the LORD,
c24559	which he commanded their fathers by the hand of Moses.
c24560	And the children of Israel dwelt among the Canaanites, Hittites, and Amorites, and Perizzites, and Hivites, and Jebusites:
c24561	And they took their daughters to be their wives,
c24562	and gave their daughters to their sons,
c24563	and served their gods.
c24564	And the children of Israel did
c24565	evil in the sight of the LORD,
c24566	and forgat the LORD their God,
c24567	and served Baalim and the groves.
c24568	Therefore the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel,
c24569	and he sold them into the hand of Chushanrishathaim king of Mesopotamia:
c24570	and the children of Israel served Chushanrishathaim eight years.
c24571	And when the children of Israel cried unto the LORD,
c24572	the LORD raised up a deliverer to the children of Israel,
c24573	who delivered
c24574	them, <i>even</i> Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother.
c24576	And the Spirit of the LORD came upon
c24577	him, and he judged Israel,
c24578	and went out to war:
c24579	and the LORD delivered Chushanrishathaim king of Mesopotamia into his hand;
c24580	and his hand prevailed against Chushanrishathaim.
c24581	And the land had rest forty years.
c24582	And Othniel the son of Kenaz died.
c24583	And the children of Israel did
c24585	evil again in the sight of the LORD:
c24586	and the LORD strengthened Eglon the king of Moab against Israel,
c24587	because they had done
c24588	evil in the sight of the LORD.
c24589	And he gathered unto him the children of Ammon and Amalek,
c24590	and went
c24591	and smote Israel,
c24592	and possessed the city of palm trees.
c24593	So the children of Israel served Eglon the king of Moab eighteen years.
c24594	But when the children of Israel cried unto the LORD,
c24595	the LORD raised them up a deliverer, Ehud the son of Gera, a Benjamite, a man lefthanded:
c24596	and by him the children of Israel sent a present unto Eglon the king of Moab.
c24597	But Ehud made him a dagger
c24598	which had two edges,
c24599	of a cubit length;
c24600	and he did gird it under his raiment upon his right thigh.
c24601	And he brought the present unto Eglon king of Moab:
c24602	and Eglon <i>was</i> a very fat man.
c24604	And when he had made an end
c24605	to offer the present,
c24606	he sent away the people that bare the present.
c24607	But he himself turned again from the quarries
c24608	that <i>were</i> by Gilgal,
c24609	and said,
c24610	I have a secret errand
c24611	unto thee, O king:
c24612	who said,
c24613	Keep silence.
c24614	And all that stood by him went out from him.
c24616	And Ehud came unto
c24617	him; and he was sitting in a summer parlour,
c24618	which he had for himself alone.
c24619	And Ehud said,
c24620	I have a message from God unto
c24621	thee. And he arose out of <i>his</i> seat.
c24622	And Ehud put forth his left hand,
c24623	and took the dagger from his right thigh,
c24624	and thrust it into his belly:
c24625	And the haft also went in after the blade;
c24626	and the fat closed upon the blade,
c24627	so that he could not draw the dagger out of his belly;
c24628	and the dirt came out.
c24629	Then Ehud went forth through the porch,
c24630	and shut the doors of the parlour upon him,
c24631	and locked them.
c24632	When he was gone out,
c24633	his servants came;
c24634	and when they saw
c24635	that, behold,
c24636	the doors of the parlour <i>were</i> locked,
c24637	they said,
c24638	Surely he covereth his feet in his summer chamber.
c24639	And they tarried
c24640	till they were ashamed:
c24641	and, behold,
c24642	he opened not the doors of the parlour;
c24643	therefore they took a key,
c24644	and opened
c24645	<i>them:</i> and, behold,
c24646	their lord <i>was</i> fallen down dead on the earth.
c24648	And Ehud escaped
c24649	while they tarried,
c24650	and passed beyond the quarries,
c24651	and escaped unto Seirath.
c24652	And it came to pass,
c24653	when he was come,
c24654	that he blew a trumpet in the mountain of Ephraim,
c24655	and the children of Israel went down with him from the mount,
c24656	and he before them.
c24657	And he said unto
c24658	them, Follow after
c24659	me: for the LORD hath delivered your enemies the Moabites into your hand.
c24660	And they went down after
c24661	him, and took the fords of Jordan toward Moab,
c24662	and suffered not a man
c24663	to pass over.
c24664	And they slew of Moab at that time about ten thousand men, all lusty, and all men of valour;
c24665	and there escaped not a man.
c24666	So Moab was subdued that day under the hand of Israel.
c24667	And the land had rest fourscore years.
c24668	And after him was Shamgar the son of Anath,
c24669	which slew of the Philistines six hundred men with an ox goad:
c24670	and he also delivered Israel.
c24671	And the children of Israel again
c24672	did
c24673	evil in the sight of the LORD,
c24674	when Ehud was dead.
c24675	And the LORD sold them into the hand of Jabin king of Canaan,
c24676	that reigned in Hazor;
c24677	the captain of whose host <i>was</i> Sisera,
c24678	which dwelt in Harosheth of the Gentiles.
c24679	And the children of Israel cried unto the LORD:
c24680	for he had nine hundred chariots of iron;
c24681	and twenty years he mightily oppressed the children of Israel.
c24682	And Deborah, a prophetess, the wife of Lapidoth,
c24683	she judged Israel at that time.
c24684	And she dwelt under the palm tree of Deborah between Ramah and Bethel in mount Ephraim:
c24685	and the children of Israel came up to her for judgment.
c24686	And she sent
c24687	and called Barak the son of Abinoam out of Kedeshnaphtali, and said unto
c24689	him, Hath not the LORD God of Israel commanded,
c24690	<i>saying,</i> Go
c24691	and draw toward mount Tabor,
c24692	and take with thee ten thousand men of the children of Naphtali and of the children of Zebulun?
c24693	And I will draw unto thee to the river Kishon Sisera, the captain of Jabin's army, with his chariots and his multitude;
c24694	and I will deliver him into thine hand.
c24695	And Barak said unto
c24696	her, If thou wilt go with
c24697	me, then I will go:
c24698	but if thou wilt not go with
c24699	me, <i>then</i> I will not go.
c24700	And she said,
c24701	I will surely go with
c24702	thee: notwithstanding the journey that thou takest shall not be for thine honour; for
c24704	the LORD shall sell Sisera into the hand of a woman.
c24705	And Deborah arose,
c24706	and went with Barak to Kedesh.
c24707	And Barak called Zebulun and Naphtali to Kedesh;
c24708	and he went up with ten thousand men at his feet:
c24709	and Deborah went up with him.
c24710	Now Heber the Kenite, <i>which was</i> of the children of Hobab the father in law of Moses, had severed himself from the Kenites,
c24711	and pitched his tent unto the plain of Zaanaim,
c24712	which <i>is</i> by Kedesh.
c24713	And they shewed Sisera
c24714	that Barak the son of Abinoam was gone up to mount Tabor.
c24715	And Sisera gathered together all his chariots, <i>even</i> nine hundred chariots of iron, and all the people
c24716	that <i>were</i> with
c24717	him, from Harosheth of the Gentiles unto the river of Kishon.
c24718	And Deborah said unto Barak,
c24719	Up;
c24720	for this <i>is</i> the day
c24721	in which the LORD hath delivered Sisera into thine hand:
c24722	is not the LORD gone out before
c24723	thee? So Barak went down from mount Tabor,
c24724	and ten thousand men after him.
c24725	And the LORD discomfited Sisera, and all <i>his</i> chariots, and all <i>his</i> host, with the edge of the sword before Barak;
c24726	so that Sisera lighted down off <i>his</i> chariot,
c24727	and fled away on his feet.
c24728	But Barak pursued after the chariots, and after the host, unto Harosheth of the Gentiles:
c24729	and all the host of Sisera fell upon the edge of the sword;
c24730	<i>and</i> there was not a man left.
c24731	Howbeit Sisera fled away on his feet to the tent of Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite:
c24732	for <i>there was</i> peace between Jabin the king of Hazor and the house of Heber the Kenite.
c24733	And Jael went out
c24734	to meet Sisera,
c24735	and said unto
c24736	him, Turn in,
c24737	my lord,
c24738	turn in to
c24739	me; fear not.
c24740	And when he had turned in unto her into the tent,
c24741	she covered him with a mantle.
c24742	And he said unto
c24743	her, Give me, I pray thee, a little water to drink;
c24744	for I am thirsty.
c24745	And she opened a bottle of milk,
c24746	and gave him drink,
c24747	and covered him.
c24748	Again he said unto
c24749	her, Stand in the door of the tent,
c24750	and it shall be,
c24751	when any man doth come
c24752	and enquire
c24753	of thee, and say,
c24754	Is there any man here?
c24755	that thou shalt say,
c24756	No.
c24757	Then Jael Heber's wife took a nail of the tent,
c24758	and took an hammer in her hand,
c24759	and went softly unto
c24760	him, and smote the nail into his temples,
c24761	and fastened it into the ground:
c24762	for he was fast asleep
c24763	and weary.
c24764	So he died.
c24765	And, behold,
c24766	as Barak pursued Sisera,
c24767	Jael came out
c24768	to meet
c24769	him, and said
c24770	unto him, Come,
c24771	and I will shew thee the man
c24772	whom thou seekest.
c24773	And when he came into
c24774	her <i>tent,</i> behold,
c24775	Sisera lay
c24776	dead,
c24777	and the nail <i>was</i> in his temples.
c24778	So God subdued on that day Jabin the king of Canaan before the children of Israel.
c24779	And the hand of the children of Israel prospered, and prevailed against Jabin the king of Canaan,
c24780	until they had destroyed Jabin king of Canaan.
c24781	Then sang Deborah and Barak the son of Abinoam on that day,
c24782	saying,
c24783	for the avenging of Israel,
c24784	when the people willingly offered themselves.
c24785	Praise ye the LORD
c24786	Hear,
c24787	O ye kings;
c24788	give ear,
c24789	O ye princes;
c24790	I,
c24791	<i>even</i> I, will sing unto the LORD;
c24792	I will sing <i>praise</i> to the LORD God of Israel.
c24793	LORD,
c24794	when thou wentest out of Seir,
c24795	when thou marchedst out of the field of Edom,
c24796	the earth trembled,
c24797	and the heavens dropped,
c24798	the clouds also dropped water.
c24799	The mountains melted from before the LORD,
c24800	<i>even</i> that Sinai
c24801	from before the LORD God of Israel.
c24802	In the days of Shamgar the son of Anath, in the days of Jael, the highways were unoccupied,
c24803	and the travellers walked through byways.
c24804	<i>The inhabitants of</i> the villages ceased, they ceased in Israel,
c24806	until that I Deborah
c24808	arose, that I arose
c24809	a mother in Israel.
c24810	They chose new gods;
c24811	then <i>was</i> war in the gates:
c24812	was there a shield
c24813	seen
c24814	or spear
c24815	among forty thousand in Israel?
c24816	My heart <i>is</i> toward the governors of Israel,
c24817	that offered themselves willingly among the people.
c24818	Bless ye the LORD.
c24819	ye that ride on white asses,
c24820	ye that sit in judgment,
c24821	and walk by the way.
c24822	Speak,
c24823	<i>They that are delivered</i> from the noise of archers in the places of drawing water, there shall they rehearse the righteous acts of the LORD, <i>even</i> the righteous acts <i>toward the inhabitants</i> of his villages in Israel:
c24824	then shall the people of the LORD go down to the gates.
c24825	Awake,
c24826	awake,
c24827	Deborah:
c24828	awake,
c24829	awake,
c24830	utter a song:
c24831	arise,
c24832	Barak,
c24833	and lead thy captivity captive,
c24834	thou son of Abinoam.
c24835	Then he made him that remaineth have dominion over the nobles among the people:
c24836	the LORD made me have dominion over the mighty.
c24837	Out of Ephraim <i>was there</i> a root of them against Amalek;
c24838	after
c24839	thee, Benjamin,
c24840	among thy people;
c24841	out of Machir came down governors,
c24842	and out of Zebulun they that handle the pen of the writer.
c24843	And the princes of Issachar <i>were</i> with Deborah;
c24844	even Issachar,
c24845	and also Barak:
c24846	he was sent on foot into the valley.
c24847	For the divisions of Reuben <i>there were</i> great thoughts of heart.
c24848	Why abodest thou among the sheepfolds,
c24849	to hear the bleatings of the flocks?
c24850	For the divisions of Reuben <i>there were</i> great searchings of heart.
c24851	Gilead abode beyond Jordan:
c24853	and why did Dan remain in ships?
c24854	Asher continued on the sea shore,
c24855	and abode in his breaches.
c24856	Zebulun and Naphtali <i>were</i> a people
c24857	<i>that</i> jeoparded their lives
c24858	unto the death
c24859	in the high places of the field.
c24860	The kings came
c24861	<i>and</i> fought,
c24862	then fought the kings of Canaan in Taanach by the waters of Megiddo;
c24863	they took no gain of money.
c24864	They fought from heaven;
c24865	the stars in their courses fought against Sisera.
c24866	The river of Kishon swept them away, that ancient river, the river Kishon.
c24867	thou hast trodden down
c24868	O my soul,
c24869	strength.
c24870	Then were the horsehoofs broken by the means of the pransings, the pransings of their mighty ones.
c24871	Curse ye Meroz,
c24872	said the angel of the LORD,
c24873	curse ye bitterly the inhabitants
c24874	thereof; because they came not to the help of the LORD, to the help of the LORD against the mighty.
c24875	Blessed above women shall Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite
c24876	be, blessed shall she be above women in the tent.
c24877	He asked water,
c24878	<i>and</i> she gave <i>him</i> milk;
c24879	she brought forth butter in a lordly dish.
c24880	She put her hand to the nail,
c24881	and her right hand to the workmen's hammer;
c24882	and with the hammer she smote Sisera,
c24883	she smote off his head,
c24884	when she had pierced
c24885	and stricken through his temples.
c24886	At her feet he bowed,
c24887	he fell,
c24888	he lay down:
c24889	at her feet he bowed,
c24890	he fell:
c24891	where he bowed,
c24892	there he fell down dead.
c24894	The mother of Sisera looked out at a window, and cried through the lattice,
c24895	Why is his chariot <i>so</i> long
c24896	in coming?
c24897	why tarry the wheels of his chariots?
c24898	Her wise ladies answered
c24899	her, yea, she returned answer to herself,
c24900	Have they not sped?
c24901	have they <i>not</i> divided the prey;
c24902	to every man a damsel <i>or</i> two;
c24903	to Sisera a prey of divers colours, a prey of divers colours of needlework,
c24904	of divers colours of needlework on both sides, <i>meet</i> for the necks of <i>them that take</i> the spoil?
c24905	So let all thine enemies perish,
c24906	O LORD:
c24907	but <i>let</i> them that love
c24908	him <i>be</i> as the sun when he goeth forth in his might.
c24909	And the land had rest forty years.
c24910	And the children of Israel did
c24911	evil in the sight of the LORD:
c24912	and the LORD delivered them into the hand of Midian seven years.
c24913	And the hand of Midian prevailed against Israel:
c24914	<i>and</i> because of the Midianites the children of Israel made them the dens
c24915	which <i>are</i> in the mountains,
c24916	and caves, and strong holds.
c24917	And <i>so</i> it was,
c24918	when Israel had sown,
c24919	that the Midianites came up, and the Amalekites, and the children of the east,
c24920	even they came up against them;
c24921	And they encamped against
c24922	them, and destroyed the increase of the earth,
c24923	till thou come unto Gaza,
c24924	and left no sustenance for Israel,
c24925	neither sheep, nor ox, nor ass.
c24926	For they came up with their cattle
c24927	and their tents,
c24928	and they came as grasshoppers for multitude;
c24929	<i>for</i> both they and their camels were without number:
c24930	and they entered into the land
c24931	to destroy it.
c24932	And Israel was greatly impoverished because of the Midianites;
c24933	and the children of Israel cried unto the LORD.
c24934	And it came to pass,
c24935	when the children of Israel cried unto the LORD because of the Midianites,
c24936	That the LORD sent a prophet unto the children of Israel,
c24937	which said
c24938	unto them, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel,
c24939	I brought you up from Egypt,
c24940	and brought you forth out of the house of bondage;
c24941	And I delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of all that oppressed
c24942	you, and drave them out from before
c24943	you, and gave you their land;
c24944	And I said
c24945	unto you, I <i>am</i> the LORD your God;
c24946	fear not the gods of the Amorites,
c24947	in whose land ye dwell:
c24948	but ye have not obeyed my voice.
c24949	And there came an angel of the LORD,
c24950	and sat under an oak
c24951	which <i>was</i> in Ophrah,
c24952	that <i>pertained</i> unto Joash the Abiezrite:
c24953	and his son Gideon threshed wheat by the winepress,
c24954	to hide <i>it</i> from the Midianites.
c24955	And the angel of the LORD appeared unto
c24956	him, and said unto
c24957	him, The LORD <i>is</i> with
c24958	thee, thou mighty man of valour.
c24959	And Gideon said unto
c24960	him, Oh my Lord,
c24961	if the LORD be with
c24962	us, why then is all this befallen
c24963	us? and where <i>be</i> all his miracles
c24964	which our fathers told
c24965	us of, saying,
c24966	Did not the LORD bring us up from Egypt?
c24967	but now the LORD hath forsaken
c24968	us, and delivered us into the hands of the Midianites.
c24969	And the LORD looked upon
c24970	him, and said,
c24971	Go in this thy might,
c24972	and thou shalt save Israel from the hand of the Midianites:
c24973	have not I sent thee?
c24974	And he said unto
c24975	him, Oh my Lord,
c24976	wherewith shall I save Israel?
c24977	behold, my family <i>is</i> poor in Manasseh,
c24978	and I <i>am</i> the least in my father's house.
c24979	And the LORD said unto
c24980	him, Surely I will be with
c24981	thee, and thou shalt smite the Midianites as one man.
c24982	And he said unto
c24983	him, If now I have found grace in thy sight,
c24984	then shew me a sign
c24985	that thou talkest with me.
c24986	Depart not hence, I pray thee,
c24987	until I come unto
c24988	thee, and bring forth my present,
c24989	and set <i>it</i> before
c24990	thee. And he said,
c24991	I will tarry
c24992	until thou come again.
c24993	And Gideon went in,
c24994	and made ready a kid, and unleavened cakes of an ephah of flour:
c24995	the flesh he put in a basket,
c24996	and he put the broth in a pot,
c24997	and brought <i>it</i> out unto him under the oak,
c24998	and presented <i>it.</i>
c24999	And the angel of God said unto
c25000	him, Take the flesh and the unleavened cakes,
c25001	and lay <i>them</i> upon this rock,
c25002	and pour out the broth.
c25003	And he did so.
c25004	Then the angel of the LORD put forth the end of the staff
c25005	that <i>was</i> in his hand,
c25006	and touched the flesh and the unleavened cakes;
c25007	and there rose up fire out of the rock,
c25008	and consumed the flesh and the unleavened cakes.
c25009	Then the angel of the LORD departed out of his sight.
c25010	And when Gideon perceived
c25011	that he <i>was</i> an angel of the LORD,
c25012	Gideon said,
c25013	Alas, O Lord GOD!
c25014	for
c25015	because I have seen an angel of the LORD face to face.
c25016	And the LORD said
c25017	unto him, Peace
c25018	<i>be</i> unto thee; fear not:
c25019	thou shalt not die.
c25020	Then Gideon built an altar there unto the LORD,
c25021	and called
c25022	it Jehovahshalom:
c25023	unto this day it <i>is</i> yet in Ophrah of the Abiezrites.
c25024	And it came to pass the same night,
c25025	that the LORD said
c25026	unto him, Take thy father's young bullock,
c25027	that
c25028	even the second bullock of seven years
c25029	old, and throw down the altar of Baal
c25030	thy father hath, and cut down
c25031	the grove that
c25032	<i>is</i> by it:
c25034	And build an altar unto the LORD thy God upon the top of this rock, in the ordered place,
c25035	and take the second bullock,
c25036	and offer a burnt sacrifice with the wood of the grove
c25037	which thou shalt cut down.
c25038	Then Gideon took ten men of his servants,
c25039	and did
c25040	as the LORD had said unto
c25041	him: and <i>so</i> it was,
c25042	because he feared his father's household, and the men of the city,
c25043	that he could not do <i>it</i> by day,
c25044	that he did <i>it</i> by night.
c25045	And when the men of the city arose early in the morning,
c25046	behold,
c25047	the altar of Baal was cast down,
c25048	and the grove
c25049	that <i>was</i> by
c25050	was cut down
c25051	it, and the second bullock was offered upon the altar
c25052	<i>that was</i> built.
c25053	And they said
c25054	one to another,
c25055	Who hath done this thing?
c25056	And when they enquired
c25057	and asked,
c25058	they said,
c25059	Gideon the son of Joash hath done this thing.
c25060	Then the men of the city said unto Joash,
c25061	Bring out thy son,
c25062	that he may die:
c25063	because he hath cast down the altar of Baal,
c25064	and because he hath cut down the grove
c25065	that <i>was</i> by it.
c25066	And Joash said unto all
c25067	that stood against
c25068	him, Will ye plead for Baal?
c25069	will ye save him? he that will plead
c25071	for him, let him be put to death whilst <i>it is yet</i> morning: if
c25072	he <i>be</i> a god,
c25073	let him plead
c25074	for himself, because <i>one</i> hath cast down his altar.
c25075	Therefore on that day he called him Jerubbaal,
c25076	saying,
c25077	Let Baal plead
c25078	against him, because he hath thrown down his altar.
c25079	Then all the Midianites and the Amalekites and the children of the east were gathered together,
c25080	and went over,
c25081	and pitched in the valley of Jezreel.
c25082	But the Spirit of the LORD came upon Gideon,
c25083	and he blew a trumpet;
c25084	and Abiezer was gathered after him.
c25085	And he sent messengers throughout all Manasseh;
c25086	who also was gathered after
c25087	him: and he sent messengers unto Asher, and unto Zebulun, and unto Naphtali;
c25088	and they came up
c25089	to meet them.
c25090	And Gideon said unto God,
c25091	If thou wilt save Israel by mine hand,
c25092	as thou hast said,
c25093	Behold, I will put a fleece of wool in the floor;
c25094	<i>and</i> if the dew be on the fleece only,
c25095	and <i>it be</i> dry upon all the earth
c25096	<i>beside,</i> then shall I know
c25097	that thou wilt save Israel by mine hand,
c25098	as thou hast said.
c25099	And it was so:
c25100	for he rose up early on the morrow,
c25101	and thrust the fleece together,
c25102	and wringed the dew out of the fleece,
c25103	a bowl full of water.
c25104	And Gideon said unto God,
c25105	Let not thine anger be hot
c25106	against me, and I will speak but this once:
c25107	let me prove, I pray thee, but this once with the fleece;
c25108	let it now be dry only upon the fleece,
c25109	and upon all the ground let there be dew.
c25110	And God did so that night:
c25111	for it was dry upon the fleece only,
c25112	and there was dew on all the ground.
c25113	Then Jerubbaal, who <i>is</i> Gideon,
c25115	and all the people
c25116	that <i>were</i> with him, rose up early,
c25117	and pitched beside the well of Harod:
c25118	so that the host of the Midianites were on the north side of them, by the hill of Moreh, in the valley.
c25119	And the LORD said unto Gideon,
c25120	The people that <i>are</i> with thee <i>are</i> too many
c25122	for me to give the Midianites into their hands,
c25123	lest Israel vaunt themselves against
c25124	me, saying,
c25125	Mine own hand hath saved me.
c25126	Now
c25127	therefore go to, proclaim in the ears of the people,
c25128	saying,
c25129	Whosoever <i>is</i> fearful and afraid,
c25130	let him return
c25131	and depart early from mount Gilead.
c25132	And there returned of the people twenty and two thousand;
c25133	and there remained ten thousand.
c25134	And the LORD said unto Gideon,
c25135	The people <i>are</i> yet <i>too</i> many;
c25136	bring them down unto the water,
c25137	and I will try them for thee there:
c25138	and it shall be,
c25139	<i>that</i> of whom I say unto
c25140	thee, This shall go with
c25141	thee, the same shall go with
c25142	thee; and of whomsoever
c25143	I say unto
c25144	thee, This shall not go with
c25145	thee, the same shall not go.
c25146	So he brought down the people unto the water:
c25147	and the LORD said unto Gideon,
c25148	Every one
c25149	that lappeth of the water with his tongue,
c25150	as a dog lappeth,
c25151	him shalt thou set by himself;
c25152	likewise every one
c25153	that boweth down upon his knees
c25154	to drink.
c25155	And the number of them that lapped, <i>putting</i> their hand to their mouth, were
c25157	three hundred men:
c25158	but all the rest of the people bowed down upon their knees
c25159	to drink water.
c25160	And the LORD said unto Gideon,
c25161	By the three hundred men
c25162	that lapped
c25163	will I save
c25164	you, and deliver the Midianites into thine hand:
c25165	and let all the <i>other</i> people go
c25166	every man unto his place.
c25167	So the people took victuals in their hand, and their trumpets:
c25168	and he sent all <i>the rest of</i> Israel every man unto his tent, and retained those three hundred men:
c25170	and the host of Midian was beneath him in the valley.
c25171	And it came to pass the same night,
c25172	that the LORD said unto
c25173	him, Arise,
c25174	get thee down unto the host;
c25175	for I have delivered it into thine hand.
c25176	But if thou fear
c25177	to go down,
c25178	go thou with Phurah thy servant down to the host:
c25179	And thou shalt hear
c25180	what they say;
c25181	and afterward shall thine hands be strengthened
c25182	to go down unto the host.
c25183	Then went he down with Phurah his servant unto the outside of the armed men
c25184	that <i>were</i> in the host.
c25185	And the Midianites and the Amalekites and all the children of the east lay along in the valley like grasshoppers for multitude;
c25186	and their camels <i>were</i> without number, as the sand
c25187	by the sea side
c25188	for multitude.
c25189	And when Gideon was come,
c25190	behold,
c25191	<i>there was</i> a man that told a dream unto his fellow,
c25192	and said,
c25193	Behold, I dreamed a dream,
c25194	and, lo, a cake of barley bread tumbled into the host of Midian,
c25195	and came unto a tent,
c25196	and smote
c25197	it that it fell,
c25198	and overturned
c25199	it, that the tent lay along.
c25200	And his fellow answered
c25201	and said,
c25202	This <i>is</i> nothing else
c25203	save the sword of Gideon the son of Joash, a man of Israel:
c25204	<i>for</i> into his hand hath God delivered Midian, and all the host.
c25205	And it was
c25206	<i>so,</i> when Gideon heard the telling of the dream, and the interpretation
c25207	thereof, that he worshipped,
c25208	and returned into the host of Israel,
c25209	and said,
c25210	Arise;
c25211	for the LORD hath delivered into your hand the host of Midian.
c25212	And he divided the three hundred men <i>into</i> three companies,
c25213	and he put a trumpet in every man's hand, with empty pitchers,
c25214	and lamps within the pitchers.
c25215	And he said unto
c25216	them, Look on
c25217	me, and do likewise:
c25218	and, behold, when I come to the outside of the camp,
c25219	it shall be
c25220	<i>that,</i> as I do,
c25221	so shall ye do.
c25222	When I blow with a trumpet, I and all
c25223	that <i>are</i> with
c25224	me, then blow ye the trumpets also on every side of all the camp,
c25225	and say,
c25226	<i>The sword</i> of the LORD, and of Gideon.
c25227	So Gideon, and the hundred men that <i>were</i> with him, came
c25229	unto the outside of the camp in the beginning of the middle watch;
c25230	and they had but newly set the watch:
c25231	and they blew the trumpets,
c25232	and brake the pitchers
c25233	that <i>were</i> in their hands.
c25234	And the three companies blew the trumpets,
c25235	and brake the pitchers,
c25236	and held the lamps in their left hands,
c25237	and the trumpets in their right hands
c25238	to blow
c25239	<i>withal:</i> and they cried,
c25240	The sword of the LORD, and of Gideon.
c25241	And they stood
c25242	every man in his place
c25243	round about the camp:
c25244	and all the host ran,
c25245	and cried,
c25246	and fled.
c25247	And the three hundred blew the trumpets,
c25248	and the LORD set every man's sword against his fellow, even throughout all the host:
c25249	and the host fled to Bethshittah in Zererath, <i>and</i> to the border of Abelmeholah, unto Tabbath.
c25250	And the men of Israel gathered themselves together out of Naphtali, and out of Asher, and out of all Manasseh,
c25251	and pursued after the Midianites.
c25252	And Gideon sent messengers throughout all mount Ephraim,
c25253	saying,
c25254	Come down
c25255	against the Midianites,
c25256	and take before them the waters unto Bethbarah and Jordan.
c25257	Then all the men of Ephraim gathered themselves together,
c25258	and took the waters unto Bethbarah and Jordan.
c25259	And they took two princes of the Midianites, Oreb and Zeeb;
c25260	and they slew Oreb upon the rock Oreb,
c25261	and Zeeb they slew at the winepress of Zeeb,
c25262	and pursued Midian,
c25263	and brought the heads of Oreb and Zeeb to Gideon on the other side Jordan.
c25264	And the men of Ephraim said unto
c25265	him, Why hast thou served us thus,
c25267	that thou calledst us not,
c25268	when thou wentest
c25269	to fight with the Midianites?
c25270	And they did chide with him sharply.
c25271	And he said unto
c25272	them, What have I done now
c25273	in comparison of you? <i>Is</i> not the gleaning of the grapes of Ephraim better than the vintage of Abiezer?
c25274	God hath delivered into your hands the princes of Midian, Oreb and Zeeb:
c25275	and what was I able
c25276	to do
c25277	in comparison of you? Then their anger was abated toward
c25278	him, when he had said that.
c25279	And Gideon came to Jordan,
c25280	<i>and</i> passed over, he, and the three hundred men
c25281	that <i>were</i> with
c25282	him, faint, yet pursuing <i>them.</i>
c25283	And he said unto the men of Succoth,
c25284	Give, I pray you, loaves of bread unto the people
c25285	that follow
c25286	me; for they <i>be</i> faint,
c25287	and I am pursuing after Zebah and Zalmunna, kings of Midian.
c25288	And the princes of Succoth said,
c25289	<i>Are</i> the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna now in thine hand,
c25290	that we should give bread unto thine army?
c25291	And Gideon said,
c25292	Therefore
c25293	when the LORD hath delivered Zebah and Zalmunna into mine hand,
c25294	then I will tear your flesh with the thorns of the wilderness and with briers.
c25295	And he went up thence to Penuel,
c25296	and spake unto them likewise:
c25297	and the men of Penuel answered
c25298	him as the men of Succoth had answered <i>him.</i>
c25299	And he spake also unto the men of Penuel,
c25300	saying,
c25301	When I come again in peace,
c25302	I will break down this tower.
c25303	Now Zebah and Zalmunna <i>were</i> in Karkor,
c25304	and their hosts with them, about fifteen thousand
c25305	<i>men,</i> all
c25306	that were left of all the hosts of the children of the east:
c25307	for there fell an hundred and twenty thousand men
c25308	that drew sword.
c25309	And Gideon went up by the way
c25310	of them that dwelt in tents
c25311	on the east of Nobah and Jogbehah,
c25312	and smote the host:
c25313	for the host was secure.
c25314	And when Zebah and Zalmunna fled,
c25315	he pursued after
c25316	them, and took the two kings of Midian, Zebah and Zalmunna,
c25317	and discomfited all the host.
c25318	And Gideon the son of Joash returned from battle before the sun <i>was up,</i>
c25319	And caught a young man of the men of Succoth, and enquired
c25321	of him: and he described unto him the princes of Succoth, and the elders thereof, <i>even</i> threescore and seventeen men.
c25322	And he came unto the men of Succoth,
c25323	and said,
c25324	Behold Zebah and Zalmunna,
c25325	with whom ye did upbraid
c25326	me, saying,
c25327	<i>Are</i> the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna now in thine hand,
c25328	that we should give bread unto thy men <i>that are</i> weary?
c25329	And he took the elders of the city, and thorns of the wilderness and briers,
c25330	and with them he taught the men of Succoth.
c25331	And he beat down the tower of Penuel,
c25332	and slew the men of the city.
c25333	Then said he unto Zebah and Zalmunna,
c25334	What manner of men
c25335	<i>were they</i> whom ye slew at Tabor?
c25336	And they answered,
c25337	As thou
c25338	<i>art,</i> so <i>were</i> they; each one resembled the children of a king.
c25339	And he said,
c25340	They <i>were</i> my brethren, <i>even</i> the sons of my mother:
c25341	<i>as</i> the LORD liveth,
c25342	if ye had saved them alive,
c25343	I would not slay you.
c25344	And he said unto Jether his firstborn,
c25345	Up,
c25346	<i>and</i> slay
c25347	them. But the youth drew not his sword:
c25348	for he feared,
c25349	because he <i>was</i> yet a youth.
c25350	Then Zebah and Zalmunna said,
c25351	Rise thou,
c25352	and fall
c25353	upon us: for as the man <i>is, so is</i> his strength.
c25354	And Gideon arose,
c25355	and slew Zebah and Zalmunna,
c25356	and took away the ornaments
c25357	that <i>were</i> on their camels' necks.
c25358	Then the men of Israel said unto Gideon,
c25359	Rule thou over us, both thou, and thy son, and thy son's son also:
c25360	for thou hast delivered us from the hand of Midian.
c25361	And Gideon said unto
c25362	them, I will not rule
c25363	over you, neither shall my son rule
c25364	over you: the LORD shall rule over you.
c25365	And Gideon said unto
c25366	them, I would desire a request of
c25367	you, that ye would give me every man the earrings of his prey.
c25368	(For they had golden earrings,
c25369	because they <i>were</i> Ishmaelites.)
c25370	And they answered,
c25371	We will willingly give
c25372	<i>them.</i> And they spread a garment,
c25373	and did cast therein every man the earrings of his prey.
c25374	And the weight of the golden earrings that he requested was
c25376	a thousand and seven hundred <i>shekels</i> of gold; beside ornaments, and collars, and purple raiment
c25377	that <i>was</i> on the kings of Midian,
c25378	and beside the chains
c25379	that <i>were</i> about their camels' necks.
c25380	And Gideon made an ephod
c25381	thereof, and put it in his city, <i>even</i> in Ophrah:
c25382	and all Israel went thither a whoring after
c25383	it: which thing became a snare unto Gideon, and to his house.
c25384	Thus was Midian subdued before the children of Israel,
c25385	no more.
c25386	so that they lifted up their heads
c25387	And the country was in quietness forty years in the days of Gideon.
c25388	And Jerubbaal the son of Joash went
c25389	and dwelt in his own house.
c25390	And Gideon had threescore and ten sons
c25391	of his body begotten:
c25392	for he had many wives.
c25393	And his concubine
c25394	that <i>was</i> in Shechem,
c25395	she also bare him a son,
c25396	whose name he called Abimelech.
c25397	And Gideon the son of Joash died in a good old age,
c25398	and was buried in the sepulchre of Joash his father, in Ophrah of the Abiezrites.
c25399	And it came to pass,
c25400	as soon as Gideon was dead,
c25401	that the children of Israel turned again,
c25402	and went a whoring after Baalim,
c25403	and made Baalberith their god.
c25404	And the children of Israel remembered not the LORD their God,
c25405	who had delivered them out of the hands of all their enemies on every side:
c25406	Neither shewed they kindness to the house of Jerubbaal, <i>namely,</i> Gideon, according to all the goodness
c25407	which he had shewed unto Israel.
c25408	And Abimelech the son of Jerubbaal went to Shechem unto his mother's brethren,
c25409	and communed with them, and with all the family of the house of his mother's father,
c25410	saying,
c25411	Speak, I pray you, in the ears of all the men of Shechem,
c25412	Whether <i>is</i> better
c25413	for you, either that all the sons of Jerubbaal, <i>which are</i> threescore and ten persons, reign
c25414	over you, or that one reign
c25415	over you? remember
c25416	also that I <i>am</i> your bone and your flesh.
c25417	And his mother's brethren spake of him in the ears of all the men of Shechem all these words:
c25418	and their hearts inclined to follow Abimelech;
c25419	for they said,
c25420	He <i>is</i> our brother.
c25421	And they gave him threescore and ten <i>pieces</i> of silver out of the house of Baalberith,
c25422	wherewith Abimelech hired vain and light persons,
c25423	which followed him.
c25424	And he went unto his father's house at Ophrah,
c25425	and slew his brethren the sons of Jerubbaal, <i>being</i> threescore and ten persons, upon one stone:
c25426	notwithstanding yet Jotham the youngest son of Jerubbaal was left;
c25427	for he hid himself.
c25428	And all the men of Shechem gathered together, and all the house of Millo,
c25429	and went,
c25430	and made Abimelech king, by the plain of the pillar
c25431	that <i>was</i> in Shechem.
c25432	And when they told <i>it</i> to Jotham,
c25433	he went
c25434	and stood in the top of mount Gerizim,
c25435	and lifted up his voice,
c25436	and cried,
c25437	and said
c25438	unto them, Hearken unto
c25439	me, ye men of Shechem,
c25440	that God may hearken unto you.
c25441	The trees went forth
c25442	<i>on a time</i> to anoint a king over
c25443	them; and they said unto the olive tree,
c25444	Reign thou over us.
c25445	But the olive tree said
c25446	unto them, Should I leave my fatness,
c25447	wherewith by me they honour God and man,
c25448	and go
c25449	to be promoted over the trees?
c25450	And the trees said to the fig tree,
c25451	Come thou,
c25452	<i>and</i> reign over us.
c25453	But the fig tree said
c25454	unto them, Should I forsake my sweetness, and my good fruit,
c25455	and go
c25456	to be promoted over the trees?
c25457	Then said the trees unto the vine,
c25458	Come thou,
c25459	<i>and</i> reign over us.
c25460	And the vine said
c25461	unto them, Should I leave my wine,
c25462	which cheereth God and man,
c25463	and go
c25464	to be promoted over the trees?
c25465	Then said all the trees unto the bramble,
c25466	Come thou,
c25467	<i>and</i> reign over us.
c25468	And the bramble said unto the trees,
c25469	If in truth ye anoint me king over
c25470	you, <i>then</i> come
c25471	<i>and</i> put your trust in my shadow:
c25472	and if not,
c25473	let fire come out of the bramble,
c25474	and devour the cedars of Lebanon.
c25475	Now
c25476	therefore, if ye have done truly and sincerely,
c25477	in that ye have made Abimelech king,
c25478	and if ye have dealt well with Jerubbaal and his house,
c25479	and have done unto him according to the deserving of his hands;
c25480	(For my father fought for
c25481	you, and adventured his life far,
c25482	and delivered you out of the hand of Midian:
c25483	And ye are risen up against my father's house this day,
c25484	and have slain his sons, threescore and ten persons, upon one stone,
c25485	and have made Abimelech, the son of his maidservant, king over the men of Shechem,
c25486	because he <i>is</i> your brother;)
c25487	If ye then have dealt truly and sincerely with Jerubbaal and with his house this day,
c25488	<i>then</i> rejoice ye in Abimelech,
c25489	and let him also rejoice in you:
c25490	But if not,
c25491	let fire come out from Abimelech,
c25492	and devour the men of Shechem, and the house of Millo;
c25493	and let fire come out from the men of Shechem, and from the house of Millo,
c25494	and devour Abimelech.
c25495	And Jotham ran away,
c25496	and fled,
c25497	and went to Beer,
c25498	and dwelt there, for fear of Abimelech his brother.
c25499	When Abimelech had reigned three years over Israel,
c25500	Then God sent an evil spirit between Abimelech and the men of Shechem;
c25501	and the men of Shechem dealt treacherously with Abimelech:
c25502	That the cruelty <i>done</i> to the threescore and ten sons of Jerubbaal might come,
c25503	and their blood
c25504	be laid upon Abimelech their brother,
c25505	which slew
c25506	them; and upon the men of Shechem,
c25507	which aided
c25508	him in the killing of his brethren.
c25509	And the men of Shechem set liers in wait for him in the top of the mountains,
c25510	and they robbed all
c25511	that came along that way by
c25512	them: and it was told Abimelech.
c25513	And Gaal the son of Ebed came with his brethren,
c25514	and went over to Shechem:
c25515	and the men of Shechem put their confidence in him.
c25516	And they went out into the fields,
c25517	and gathered their vineyards,
c25518	and trode
c25519	<i>the grapes,</i> and made merry,
c25520	and went into the house of their god,
c25521	and did eat
c25522	and drink,
c25523	and cursed Abimelech.
c25524	And Gaal the son of Ebed said,
c25525	Who <i>is</i> Abimelech,
c25526	and who <i>is</i> Shechem,
c25527	that we should serve
c25528	him? <i>is</i> not <i>he</i> the son of Jerubbaal?
c25529	and Zebul his officer?
c25530	serve the men of Hamor the father of Shechem:
c25531	for why should we serve him?
c25532	And would to God this people were under my hand!
c25533	then would I remove Abimelech.
c25534	And he said to Abimelech,
c25535	Increase thine army,
c25536	and come out.
c25537	And when Zebul the ruler of the city heard the words of Gaal the son of Ebed,
c25538	his anger was kindled.
c25539	And he sent messengers unto Abimelech privily,
c25540	saying,
c25541	Behold, Gaal the son of Ebed and his brethren be come to Shechem;
c25542	and, behold, they fortify the city against thee.
c25543	Now
c25544	therefore up by night, thou and the people
c25545	that <i>is</i> with
c25546	thee, and lie in wait in the field:
c25547	And it shall be,
c25548	<i>that</i> in the morning,
c25549	as soon as the sun is up,
c25550	thou shalt rise early,
c25551	and set upon the city:
c25552	and, behold, <i>when</i> he and the people
c25553	that <i>is</i> with
c25554	him come out against
c25555	thee, then mayest thou do
c25556	to them as thou shalt find occasion.
c25557	And Abimelech rose up, and all the people
c25558	that <i>were</i> with
c25559	him, by night,
c25560	and they laid wait against Shechem in four companies.
c25561	And Gaal the son of Ebed went out,
c25562	and stood in the entering of the gate of the city:
c25563	and Abimelech rose up, and the people
c25564	that <i>were</i> with
c25565	him, from lying in wait.
c25566	And when Gaal saw the people,
c25567	he said to Zebul,
c25568	Behold, there come people down from the top of the mountains.
c25569	And Zebul said unto
c25570	him, Thou seest the shadow of the mountains as <i>if they were</i> men.
c25571	And Gaal spake again
c25573	and said,
c25574	See there come people down by the middle of the land,
c25575	and another company come along by the plain of Meonenim.
c25576	Then said Zebul unto
c25577	him, Where <i>is</i> now thy mouth,
c25578	wherewith thou saidst,
c25579	Who <i>is</i> Abimelech,
c25580	that we should serve
c25581	him? <i>is</i> not this the people
c25582	that thou hast despised?
c25583	go out, I pray now,
c25584	and fight with them.
c25585	And Gaal went out before the men of Shechem,
c25586	and fought with Abimelech.
c25587	And Abimelech chased
c25588	him, and he fled before
c25589	him, and many were overthrown <i>and</i> wounded, <i>even</i> unto the entering of the gate.
c25590	And Abimelech dwelt at Arumah:
c25591	and Zebul thrust out Gaal and his brethren,
c25592	that they should not dwell in Shechem.
c25593	And it came to pass on the morrow,
c25594	that the people went out into the field;
c25595	and they told Abimelech.
c25596	And he took the people,
c25597	and divided them into three companies,
c25598	and laid wait in the field,
c25599	and looked,
c25600	and, behold,
c25601	the people <i>were</i> come forth out of the city;
c25602	and he rose up against
c25603	them, and smote them.
c25604	And Abimelech, and the company
c25605	that <i>was</i> with
c25606	him, rushed forward,
c25607	and stood in the entering of the gate of the city:
c25608	and the two <i>other</i> companies ran upon all
c25609	<i>the people</i> that <i>were</i> in the fields,
c25610	and slew them.
c25611	And Abimelech fought against the city all that day;
c25612	and he took the city,
c25613	the people
c25614	that
c25615	and slew
c25616	<i>was</i> therein, and beat down the city,
c25617	and sowed it with salt.
c25618	And when all the men of the tower of Shechem heard
c25619	<i>that,</i> they entered into an hold of the house of the god Berith.
c25620	And it was told Abimelech,
c25621	that all the men of the tower of Shechem were gathered together.
c25622	And Abimelech gat him up to mount Zalmon, he and all the people
c25623	that <i>were</i> with
c25624	him; and Abimelech took an axe in his hand,
c25625	and cut down a bough from the trees,
c25626	and took
c25627	it, and laid <i>it</i> on his shoulder,
c25628	and said unto the people
c25629	that <i>were</i> with
c25630	him, What ye have seen
c25631	me do,
c25632	make haste,
c25633	<i>and</i> do as I <i>have done.</i>
c25634	And all the people likewise cut down every man his bough,
c25635	and followed Abimelech,
c25636	and put <i>them</i> to the hold,
c25637	and set the hold on fire upon
c25638	them; so that all the men of the tower of Shechem died also, about a thousand men and women.
c25639	Then went Abimelech to Thebez,
c25640	and encamped against Thebez,
c25641	and took it.
c25642	But there was a strong tower within the city,
c25643	and thither fled all the men and women, and all they of the city,
c25644	and shut <i>it</i> to
c25645	them, and gat them up to the top of the tower.
c25646	And Abimelech came unto the tower,
c25647	and fought
c25648	against it, and went hard unto the door of the tower
c25649	to burn it with fire.
c25650	And a certain woman cast a piece of a millstone upon Abimelech's head,
c25651	and all to brake his skull.
c25652	Then he called hastily unto the young man his armourbearer,
c25653	and said
c25654	unto him, Draw thy sword,
c25655	and slay
c25656	me, that men say
c25657	not of me, A woman slew
c25658	him. And his young man thrust him through,
c25659	and he died.
c25660	And when the men of Israel saw
c25661	that Abimelech was dead,
c25662	they departed
c25663	every man unto his place.
c25664	Thus God rendered the wickedness of Abimelech,
c25665	which he did unto his father,
c25666	in slaying his seventy brethren:
c25667	And all the evil of the men of Shechem did God render upon their heads:
c25668	and upon them came the curse of Jotham the son of Jerubbaal.
c25669	And after Abimelech there arose
c25670	to defend Israel
c25671	Tola the son of Puah, the son of Dodo, a man of Issachar;
c25672	and he dwelt in Shamir in mount Ephraim.
c25673	And he judged Israel twenty and three years,
c25674	and died,
c25675	and was buried in Shamir.
c25676	And after him arose Jair, a Gileadite,
c25677	and judged Israel twenty and two years.
c25678	And he had thirty sons
c25679	that rode on thirty ass colts,
c25680	and they had thirty cities,
c25681	which are called Havothjair unto this day,
c25682	which <i>are</i> in the land of Gilead.
c25683	And Jair died,
c25684	and was buried in Camon.
c25685	And the children of Israel did
c25687	evil again in the sight of the LORD,
c25688	and served Baalim, and Ashtaroth, and the gods of Syria, and the gods of Zidon, and the gods of Moab, and the gods of the children of Ammon, and the gods of the Philistines,
c25689	and forsook the LORD,
c25690	and served not him.
c25691	And the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel,
c25692	and he sold them into the hands of the Philistines, and into the hands of the children of Ammon.
c25694	And that year they vexed and oppressed the children of Israel:
c25695	eighteen years, all the children of Israel
c25696	that <i>were</i> on the other side Jordan in the land of the Amorites,
c25697	which <i>is</i> in Gilead.
c25698	Moreover the children of Ammon passed over Jordan
c25699	to fight also against Judah, and against Benjamin, and against the house of Ephraim;
c25700	so that Israel was sore distressed.
c25701	And the children of Israel cried unto the LORD,
c25702	saying,
c25703	We have sinned
c25704	against thee, both because we have forsaken our God,
c25705	and also served Baalim.
c25706	And the LORD said unto the children of Israel,
c25707	<i>Did</i> not <i>I deliver you</i> from the Egyptians, and from the Amorites, from the children of Ammon, and from the Philistines?
c25708	The Zidonians also, and the Amalekites, and the Maonites, did oppress
c25709	you; and ye cried to
c25710	me, and I delivered you out of their hand.
c25711	Yet ye have forsaken
c25712	me, and served other gods:
c25713	wherefore I will deliver you no more.
c25715	Go
c25716	and cry unto the gods
c25717	which ye have chosen;
c25718	let them deliver you in the time of your tribulation.
c25719	And the children of Israel said unto the LORD,
c25720	We have sinned:
c25721	do thou unto us whatsoever
c25722	seemeth good unto
c25723	thee; deliver us only, we pray thee, this day.
c25724	And they put away the strange gods from among
c25725	them, and served the LORD:
c25726	and his soul was grieved for the misery of Israel.
c25727	Then the children of Ammon were gathered together,
c25728	and encamped in Gilead.
c25729	And the children of Israel assembled themselves together,
c25730	and encamped in Mizpeh.
c25731	And the people <i>and</i> princes of Gilead said
c25732	one to another,
c25733	What man
c25734	<i>is he</i> that will begin
c25735	to fight against the children of Ammon?
c25736	he shall be head over all the inhabitants of Gilead.
c25737	Now Jephthah the Gileadite was a mighty man of valour,
c25738	and he <i>was</i> the son of an harlot:
c25739	and Gilead begat Jephthah.
c25740	And Gilead's wife bare him sons;
c25741	and his wife's sons grew up,
c25742	and they thrust out Jephthah,
c25743	and said
c25744	unto him, Thou shalt not inherit in our father's house;
c25745	for thou <i>art</i> the son of a strange woman.
c25746	Then Jephthah fled from his brethren,
c25747	and dwelt in the land of Tob:
c25748	and there were gathered vain men to Jephthah,
c25749	and went out with him.
c25750	And it came to pass in process of time,
c25751	that the children of Ammon made war against Israel.
c25752	And it was
c25753	so, that when the children of Ammon made war against Israel,
c25754	the elders of Gilead went
c25755	to fetch Jephthah out of the land of Tob:
c25756	And they said unto Jephthah,
c25757	Come,
c25758	and be our captain,
c25759	that we may fight with the children of Ammon.
c25760	And Jephthah said unto the elders of Gilead,
c25761	Did not ye hate
c25762	me, and expel me out of my father's house?
c25763	and why are ye come unto me now
c25764	when ye are in distress?
c25765	And the elders of Gilead said unto Jephthah,
c25766	Therefore we turn again to thee now,
c25767	that thou mayest go with
c25768	us, and fight against the children of Ammon,
c25769	and be our head over all the inhabitants of Gilead.
c25770	And Jephthah said unto the elders of Gilead,
c25771	If ye bring me home again
c25772	to fight against the children of Ammon,
c25773	and the LORD deliver them before
c25774	me, shall I be your head?
c25775	And the elders of Gilead said unto Jephthah,
c25776	The LORD be
c25777	witness between
c25778	us, if we do not so according to thy words.
c25780	Then Jephthah went with the elders of Gilead,
c25781	and the people made him head and captain over
c25782	them: and Jephthah uttered all his words before the LORD in Mizpeh.
c25783	And Jephthah sent messengers unto the king of the children of Ammon,
c25784	saying,
c25785	What
c25786	hast thou to do with me, that thou art come against
c25787	me to fight in my land?
c25788	And the king of the children of Ammon answered unto the messengers of Jephthah,
c25789	Because Israel took away my land,
c25790	when they came up out of Egypt,
c25791	from Arnon even unto Jabbok, and unto Jordan:
c25792	now therefore restore those <i>lands</i> again peaceably.
c25793	And Jephthah sent messengers again
c25794	unto the king of the children of Ammon:
c25795	And said
c25796	unto him, Thus saith Jephthah,
c25797	Israel took not away the land of Moab, nor the land of the children of Ammon:
c25798	But
c25800	when Israel came up from Egypt, and walked through the wilderness unto the Red sea,
c25801	and came to Kadesh;
c25802	Then Israel sent messengers unto the king of Edom,
c25803	saying,
c25804	Let me, I pray thee, pass through thy land:
c25805	but the king of Edom would not hearken
c25806	<i>thereto.</i> And in like manner they sent unto the king of Moab:
c25807	but he would not
c25808	<i>consent:</i> and Israel abode in Kadesh.
c25809	Then they went along through the wilderness,
c25810	and compassed the land of Edom, and the land of Moab,
c25811	and came by the east side of the land of Moab,
c25812	and pitched on the other side of Arnon,
c25813	but came not within the border of Moab:
c25814	for Arnon <i>was</i> the border of Moab.
c25815	And Israel sent messengers unto Sihon king of the Amorites, the king of Heshbon;
c25816	and Israel said
c25817	unto him, Let us pass, we pray thee, through thy land into my place.
c25818	But Sihon trusted not Israel
c25819	to pass through his coast:
c25820	but Sihon gathered all his people together,
c25821	and pitched in Jahaz,
c25822	and fought against Israel.
c25823	And the LORD God of Israel delivered Sihon and all his people into the hand of Israel,
c25824	and they smote
c25825	them: so Israel possessed all the land of the Amorites,
c25826	the inhabitants of that country.
c25827	And they possessed all the coasts of the Amorites, from Arnon even unto Jabbok, and from the wilderness even unto Jordan.
c25828	So now
c25829	the LORD God of Israel hath dispossessed the Amorites from before his people Israel,
c25830	and shouldest thou possess it?
c25831	Wilt not
c25832	thou possess that which Chemosh thy god
c25833	giveth thee to possess?
c25834	So whomsoever
c25835	the LORD our God shall drive out from before
c25836	us, them will we possess.
c25837	And now
c25838	<i>art</i> thou any thing better than Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab?
c25839	did he ever strive against Israel,
c25840	or did he ever fight against them,
c25841	While Israel dwelt in Heshbon and her towns, and in Aroer and her towns, and in all the cities
c25842	that <i>be</i> along by the coasts of Arnon,
c25843	three hundred years?
c25844	why therefore did ye not recover <i>them</i> within that time?
c25845	Wherefore I have not sinned
c25846	against thee, but thou doest me wrong
c25847	to war
c25848	against me: the LORD the Judge be judge this day between the children of Israel and the children of Ammon.
c25849	Howbeit the king of the children of Ammon hearkened not unto the words of Jephthah
c25850	which he sent him.
c25851	Then the Spirit of the LORD came upon Jephthah,
c25852	and he passed over Gilead, and Manasseh,
c25853	and passed over Mizpeh of Gilead,
c25854	and from Mizpeh of Gilead he passed over <i>unto</i> the children of Ammon.
c25855	And Jephthah vowed a vow unto the LORD,
c25856	and said,
c25857	If thou shalt without fail deliver the children of Ammon into mine hands,
c25858	Then it shall be,
c25860	that whatsoever cometh forth of the doors of my house
c25861	to meet
c25862	me, when I return in peace from the children of Ammon,
c25863	shall surely be the LORD'S,
c25864	and I will offer it up for a burnt offering.
c25865	So Jephthah passed over unto the children of Ammon
c25866	to fight
c25867	against them; and the LORD delivered them into his hands.
c25868	And he smote them from Aroer,
c25869	even till thou come to Minnith,
c25870	<i>even</i> twenty cities, and unto the plain of the vineyards, with a very great slaughter.
c25871	Thus the children of Ammon were subdued before the children of Israel.
c25872	And Jephthah came to Mizpeh unto his house,
c25873	and, behold, his daughter came out
c25874	to meet him with timbrels and with dances:
c25875	and she <i>was his</i> only child;
c25876	beside her he had neither son nor daughter.
c25877	And it came to pass,
c25878	when he saw
c25879	her, that he rent his clothes,
c25880	and said,
c25881	Alas, my daughter!
c25882	thou hast brought me very low,
c25883	and thou art one of them that trouble
c25884	me: for I have opened my mouth unto the LORD,
c25885	and I cannot
c25886	go back.
c25887	And she said unto
c25888	him, My father,
c25889	<i>if</i> thou hast opened thy mouth unto the LORD,
c25890	do
c25891	to me according to that which hath proceeded out of thy mouth;
c25892	forasmuch as the LORD hath taken vengeance for thee of thine enemies, <i>even</i> of the children of Ammon.
c25893	And she said unto her father,
c25894	Let this thing be done
c25895	for me: let me alone two months,
c25896	that I may go up
c25897	and down upon the mountains,
c25898	and bewail my virginity, I and my fellows.
c25899	And he said,
c25900	Go.
c25901	And he sent her away <i>for</i> two months:
c25902	and she went with her companions,
c25903	and bewailed her virginity upon the mountains.
c25904	And it came to pass at the end of two months,
c25905	that she returned unto her father,
c25906	who did with her <i>according</i> to his vow
c25907	which he had vowed:
c25908	and she knew no man.
c25909	And it was a custom in Israel,
c25910	<i>That</i> the daughters of Israel went yearly
c25911	to lament the daughter of Jephthah the Gileadite four days in a year.
c25912	And the men of Ephraim gathered themselves together,
c25913	and went northward,
c25914	and said unto Jephthah,
c25915	Wherefore passedst thou over
c25916	to fight against the children of Ammon,
c25917	and didst not call
c25918	us to go with
c25919	thee? we will burn thine house upon thee with fire.
c25920	And Jephthah said unto
c25921	them, I and my people were at great strife with the children of Ammon;
c25922	and when I called
c25923	you, ye delivered me not out of their hands.
c25924	And when I saw
c25925	that ye delivered <i>me</i> not,
c25926	I put my life in my hands,
c25927	and passed over against the children of Ammon,
c25928	and the LORD delivered them into my hand:
c25929	wherefore then are ye come up unto me this day,
c25930	to fight against me?
c25931	Then Jephthah gathered together all the men of Gilead,
c25932	and fought with Ephraim:
c25933	and the men of Gilead smote Ephraim,
c25934	because they said,
c25935	Ye Gileadites <i>are</i> fugitives of Ephraim
c25937	among the Ephraimites, <i>and</i> among the Manassites.
c25938	And the Gileadites took the passages of Jordan before the Ephraimites:
c25939	and it was
c25940	<i>so,</i> that when those Ephraimites which were escaped said,
c25941	Let me go over;
c25942	that the men of Gilead said
c25943	unto him, <i>Art</i> thou an Ephraimite?
c25944	If he said,
c25945	Nay;
c25946	Then said
c25947	they unto him, Say now
c25948	Shibboleth:
c25949	and he said
c25950	Sibboleth:
c25951	for he could not frame
c25952	to pronounce <i>it</i> right.
c25953	Then they took
c25954	him, and slew him at the passages of Jordan:
c25955	and there fell at that time of the Ephraimites forty and two thousand.
c25956	And Jephthah judged Israel six years.
c25957	Then died Jephthah the Gileadite,
c25958	and was buried in <i>one of</i> the cities of Gilead.
c25959	And after him Ibzan of Bethlehem judged Israel.
c25960	And he had thirty sons, and thirty daughters,
c25961	<i>whom</i> he sent abroad,
c25962	and took in thirty daughters from abroad for his sons.
c25963	And he judged Israel seven years.
c25964	Then died Ibzan,
c25965	and was buried at Bethlehem.
c25966	And after him Elon, a Zebulonite, judged Israel;
c25967	and he judged Israel ten years.
c25968	And Elon the Zebulonite died,
c25969	and was buried in Aijalon in the country of Zebulun.
c25970	And after him Abdon the son of Hillel, a Pirathonite, judged Israel.
c25971	And he had forty sons and thirty nephews,
c25972	that rode on threescore and ten ass colts:
c25973	and he judged Israel eight years.
c25974	And Abdon the son of Hillel the Pirathonite died,
c25975	and was buried in Pirathon in the land of Ephraim, in the mount of the Amalekites.
c25976	And the children of Israel did
c25978	evil again in the sight of the LORD;
c25979	and the LORD delivered them into the hand of the Philistines forty years.
c25980	And there was a certain man of Zorah, of the family of the Danites,
c25981	whose name <i>was</i> Manoah;
c25982	and his wife <i>was</i> barren,
c25983	and bare not.
c25984	And the angel of the LORD appeared unto the woman,
c25985	and said unto
c25986	her, Behold now, thou <i>art</i> barren,
c25987	and bearest not:
c25988	but thou shalt conceive,
c25989	and bear a son.
c25990	Now therefore beware, I pray thee,
c25991	and drink not wine nor strong drink,
c25992	and eat not any unclean <i>thing:</i>
c25993	For, lo, thou shalt conceive,
c25994	and bear a son;
c25995	and no razor shall come on his head:
c25996	for the child shall be a Nazarite unto God from the womb:
c25997	and he shall begin
c25998	to deliver Israel out of the hand of the Philistines.
c25999	Then the woman came
c26000	and told her husband,
c26001	saying,
c26002	A man of God came unto
c26003	me, and his countenance <i>was</i> like the countenance of an angel of God,
c26004	very terrible:
c26005	but I asked him not
c26006	whence he
c26007	<i>was,</i> neither told he me his name:
c26008	But he said
c26009	unto me, Behold, thou shalt conceive,
c26010	and bear a son;
c26011	and now
c26012	drink no wine nor strong drink,
c26013	neither eat any unclean
c26014	<i>thing:</i> for the child shall be a Nazarite to God from the womb to the day of his death.
c26015	Then Manoah intreated the LORD,
c26016	and said,
c26017	O my Lord,
c26018	let the man of God
c26019	which thou didst send
c26020	come again unto
c26021	us, and teach
c26022	us what we shall do unto the child
c26023	that shall be born.
c26024	And God hearkened to the voice of Manoah;
c26025	and the angel of God came again unto the woman
c26026	as she sat in the field:
c26027	but Manoah her husband <i>was</i> not with her.
c26028	her husband,
c26029	and ran, and shewed
c26030	And the woman made haste,
c26031	and said unto
c26032	him, Behold, the man hath appeared unto
c26033	me, that came unto me the <i>other</i> day.
c26035	And Manoah arose, and went after his wife,
c26036	and came to the man,
c26037	and said
c26038	unto him, <i>Art</i> thou the man
c26039	that spakest unto the woman?
c26040	And he said,
c26041	I <i>am.</i>
c26042	And Manoah said,
c26043	Now let thy words come to pass.
c26044	How shall we order the child, and <i>how</i> shall we do unto him?
c26045	And the angel of the LORD said unto Manoah,
c26046	Of all
c26047	that I said unto the woman
c26048	let her beware.
c26049	of any
c26050	<i>thing</i> that cometh of the vine, neither let her drink wine
c26051	She may not eat
c26052	or strong drink,
c26053	nor eat any unclean
c26054	<i>thing:</i> all
c26055	that I commanded
c26056	her let her observe.
c26057	And Manoah said unto the angel of the LORD,
c26058	I pray thee, let us detain
c26059	thee, until we shall have made ready a kid for thee.
c26060	And the angel of the LORD said unto Manoah,
c26061	Though thou detain
c26062	me, I will not eat of thy bread:
c26063	and if thou wilt offer a burnt offering,
c26064	thou must offer it unto the LORD.
c26065	For Manoah knew not
c26066	that he <i>was</i> an angel of the LORD.
c26067	And Manoah said unto the angel of the LORD,
c26068	What <i>is</i> thy name,
c26069	that when thy sayings come to pass
c26070	we may do thee honour?
c26071	And the angel of the LORD said
c26072	unto him, Why askest thou thus after my name,
c26073	seeing it <i>is</i> secret?
c26074	So Manoah took a kid with a meat offering,
c26075	and offered <i>it</i> upon a rock unto the LORD:
c26076	wondrously;
c26077	and <i>the angel</i> did
c26078	and Manoah and his wife looked on.
c26079	For it came to pass,
c26080	when the flame went up toward heaven from off the altar,
c26081	that the angel of the LORD ascended in the flame of the altar.
c26082	And Manoah and his wife looked on
c26083	<i>it,</i> and fell on their faces to the ground.
c26084	But the angel of the LORD did no more
c26085	appear to Manoah and to his wife.
c26086	Then Manoah knew
c26087	that he <i>was</i> an angel of the LORD.
c26088	And Manoah said unto his wife,
c26089	We shall surely die,
c26090	because we have seen God.
c26091	But his wife said
c26092	unto him, If the LORD were pleased
c26093	to kill
c26094	us, he would not have received a burnt offering and a meat offering at our hands,
c26095	neither would he have shewed us all these
c26096	<i>things,</i> nor would as at this time have told us <i>such things</i> as these.
c26097	And the woman bare a son,
c26098	and called his name Samson:
c26099	and the child grew,
c26100	and the LORD blessed him.
c26101	And the Spirit of the LORD began
c26102	to move him at times in the camp of Dan between Zorah and Eshtaol.
c26103	And Samson went down to Timnath,
c26104	and saw a woman in Timnath of the daughters of the Philistines.
c26105	And he came up,
c26106	and told his father and his mother,
c26107	and said,
c26108	I have seen a woman in Timnath of the daughters of the Philistines:
c26109	now therefore get her for me to wife.
c26110	Then his father and his mother said
c26111	unto him, <i>Is there</i> never a woman among the daughters of thy brethren, or among all my people,
c26112	that thou goest
c26113	to take a wife of the uncircumcised Philistines?
c26114	And Samson said unto his father,
c26115	Get
c26116	her for me; for she pleaseth me well.
c26117	But his father and his mother knew not
c26118	that it <i>was</i> of the LORD,
c26119	that he sought an occasion against the Philistines:
c26120	for at that time the Philistines had dominion over Israel.
c26121	Then went Samson down, and his father and his mother, to Timnath,
c26122	and came to the vineyards of Timnath:
c26123	and, behold, a young lion roared
c26124	against him.
c26125	And the Spirit of the LORD came mightily upon
c26126	him, and he rent
c26127	him as he would have rent a kid,
c26128	and <i>he had</i> nothing in his hand:
c26129	but he told not his father or his mother
c26130	what he had done.
c26131	And he went down,
c26132	and talked with the woman;
c26133	and she pleased Samson well.
c26134	And after a time he returned
c26135	to take
c26136	her, and he turned aside
c26137	to see the carcase of the lion:
c26138	and, behold, <i>there was</i> a swarm of bees and honey in the carcase of the lion.
c26140	And he took thereof in his hands,
c26141	and went on eating,
c26142	and came to his father and mother,
c26143	and he gave
c26144	them, and they did eat:
c26145	but he told not
c26146	them that he had taken the honey out of the carcase of the lion.
c26147	So his father went down unto the woman:
c26148	and Samson made there a feast;
c26149	for so used the young men to do.
c26150	And it came to pass,
c26151	when they saw
c26152	him, that they brought thirty companions
c26153	to be with him.
c26154	And Samson said
c26155	unto them, I will now put forth a riddle
c26156	unto you: if ye can certainly declare it me within the seven days of the feast,
c26157	and find <i>it</i> out,
c26158	then I will give you thirty sheets and thirty change of garments:
c26159	But if ye cannot
c26160	declare
c26161	<i>it</i> me, then shall ye give me thirty sheets and thirty change of garments.
c26162	And they said
c26163	unto him, Put forth thy riddle,
c26164	that we may hear it.
c26165	And he said
c26166	unto them, Out of the eater came forth meat,
c26167	and out of the strong came forth sweetness.
c26168	And they could not
c26169	expound the riddle.
c26170	in three days
c26171	And it came to pass on the seventh day,
c26172	that they said unto Samson's wife,
c26173	Entice thy husband,
c26174	that he may declare unto us the riddle,
c26175	lest we burn thee and thy father's house with fire:
c26176	us to take that we have?
c26177	have ye called
c26178	<i>is it</i> not <i>so?</i>
c26179	And Samson's wife wept before
c26180	him, and said,
c26181	Thou dost but hate
c26182	me, and lovest me not:
c26183	thou hast put forth a riddle unto the children of my people,
c26184	and hast not told
c26185	<i>it</i> me. And he said
c26186	unto her, Behold, I have not told <i>it</i> my father nor my mother,
c26187	and shall I tell <i>it</i> thee?
c26188	And she wept before him the seven days,
c26189	while their feast lasted:
c26190	and it came to pass on the seventh day,
c26191	that he told
c26192	her, because she lay sore
c26193	upon him: and she told the riddle to the children of her people.
c26194	And the men of the city said unto him on the seventh day
c26195	before the sun went down,
c26196	What <i>is</i> sweeter than honey?
c26197	and what <i>is</i> stronger than a lion?
c26198	And he said
c26199	unto them, If ye had not plowed with my heifer,
c26200	ye had not found out my riddle.
c26201	And the Spirit of the LORD came upon
c26202	him, and he went down to Ashkelon,
c26203	and slew thirty men of
c26204	them, and took their spoil,
c26205	and gave change of garments unto them which expounded the riddle.
c26206	And his anger was kindled,
c26207	and he went up to his father's house.
c26208	But Samson's wife was <i>given</i> to his companion,
c26209	whom he had used as his friend.
c26210	But it came to pass within a while after, in the time of wheat harvest,
c26211	that Samson visited his wife with a kid;
c26212	and he said,
c26213	I will go in to my wife into the chamber.
c26214	But her father would not suffer
c26215	him to go in.
c26216	And her father said,
c26217	I verily thought
c26218	that thou hadst utterly hated
c26219	her; therefore I gave her to thy companion:
c26220	<i>is</i> not her younger sister fairer than
c26221	she? take her, I pray thee, instead of her.
c26222	And Samson said
c26223	concerning them, Now shall I be more blameless than the Philistines,
c26224	though I do them a displeasure.
c26225	And Samson went
c26226	and caught three hundred foxes,
c26227	and took firebrands,
c26228	and turned tail to tail,
c26229	and put a firebrand in the midst between two tails.
c26230	And when he had set the brands on fire,
c26231	he let <i>them</i> go into the standing corn of the Philistines,
c26232	and burnt up both the shocks, and also the standing corn, with the vineyards <i>and</i> olives.
c26233	Then the Philistines said,
c26234	Who hath done this?
c26235	And they answered,
c26236	Samson, the son in law of the Timnite,
c26237	because he had taken his wife,
c26238	and given her to his companion.
c26239	And the Philistines came up,
c26240	and burnt her and her father with fire.
c26241	And Samson said
c26242	unto them, Though ye have done this,
c26243	yet will I be avenged
c26244	of you, and after that I will cease.
c26245	And he smote them hip and thigh
c26246	with a great slaughter:
c26247	and he went down
c26248	and dwelt in the top of the rock Etam.
c26249	Then the Philistines went up,
c26250	and pitched in Judah,
c26251	and spread themselves in Lehi.
c26252	And the men of Judah said,
c26253	Why are ye come up against
c26254	us? And they answered,
c26255	To bind Samson
c26256	are we come up,
c26257	to do
c26258	to him as he hath done to us.
c26259	Then three thousand men of Judah went to the top of the rock Etam,
c26260	and said to Samson,
c26261	Knowest thou not
c26262	that the Philistines <i>are</i> rulers
c26263	over us? what <i>is</i> this <i>that</i> thou hast done
c26264	unto us? And he said
c26265	unto them, As they did
c26266	unto me, so have I done unto them.
c26267	And they said
c26268	to bind
c26269	unto him, We are come down
c26270	thee, that we may deliver thee into the hand of the Philistines.
c26271	And Samson said
c26272	unto them, Swear
c26273	unto me, that ye will not fall upon me yourselves.
c26274	And they spake
c26275	unto him, saying,
c26276	No;
c26277	but we will bind thee fast,
c26278	and deliver thee into their hand:
c26279	but surely we will not kill
c26280	thee. And they bound him with two new cords,
c26281	and brought him up from the rock.
c26282	<i>And</i> when he came unto Lehi,
c26283	the Philistines shouted
c26284	against
c26285	him: and the Spirit of the LORD came mightily upon
c26286	him, and the cords that <i>were</i> upon his arms became
c26288	as flax
c26289	that was burnt with fire,
c26290	and his bands loosed from off his hands.
c26291	And he found a new jawbone of an ass,
c26292	and put forth his hand,
c26293	and took
c26294	it, and slew a thousand men therewith.
c26295	And Samson said,
c26296	With the jawbone of an ass, heaps upon heaps,
c26297	with the jaw of an ass have I slain a thousand men.
c26298	And it came to pass,
c26299	when he had made an end
c26300	of speaking,
c26301	that he cast away the jawbone out of his hand,
c26302	and called that place Ramathlehi.
c26303	And he was sore athirst,
c26304	and called on the LORD,
c26305	and said,
c26306	Thou hast given this great deliverance into the hand of thy servant:
c26307	and now shall I die for thirst,
c26308	and fall into the hand of the uncircumcised?
c26309	But God clave an hollow place
c26310	that <i>was</i> in the jaw,
c26311	and there came water thereout;
c26312	and when he had drunk,
c26313	his spirit came again,
c26314	and he revived:
c26315	wherefore he called the name thereof Enhakkore,
c26316	which <i>is</i> in Lehi
c26317	unto this day.
c26318	And he judged Israel in the days of the Philistines twenty years.
c26319	Then went Samson to Gaza,
c26320	and saw there an harlot,
c26321	and went in unto her.
c26322	<i>And it was told</i> the Gazites,
c26323	saying,
c26324	Samson is come hither.
c26325	And they compassed
c26326	<i>him</i> in, and laid wait for him all night in the gate of the city,
c26327	and were quiet all the night,
c26328	saying,
c26329	In the morning, when it is day,
c26330	we shall kill him.
c26331	And Samson lay till midnight,
c26332	and arose at midnight,
c26333	and took the doors of the gate of the city, and the two posts,
c26334	and went away with them, bar and all,
c26335	and put <i>them</i> upon his shoulders,
c26336	and carried them up to the top of an hill
c26337	that <i>is</i> before Hebron.
c26338	And it came to pass afterward,
c26339	that he loved a woman in the valley of Sorek,
c26340	whose name <i>was</i> Delilah.
c26341	And the lords of the Philistines came up unto
c26342	her, and said
c26343	unto her, Entice
c26344	him, and see
c26345	wherein his great strength
c26346	<i>lieth,</i> and by what <i>means</i> we may prevail
c26347	against him, that we may bind
c26348	him to afflict
c26349	him: and we will give thee every one of us eleven hundred <i>pieces</i> of silver.
c26350	And Delilah said to Samson,
c26351	Tell me, I pray thee,
c26352	wherein thy great strength
c26353	<i>lieth,</i> and wherewith thou mightest be bound
c26354	to afflict thee.
c26355	And Samson said unto
c26356	her, If they bind me with seven green withs
c26357	that were never dried,
c26358	then shall I be weak,
c26359	and be as another man.
c26360	Then the lords of the Philistines brought up to her seven green withs
c26361	which had not been dried,
c26362	and she bound him with them.
c26363	Now <i>there were</i> men lying in wait, abiding with her in the chamber.
c26364	And she said unto
c26365	him, The Philistines <i>be</i> upon
c26366	thee, Samson.
c26367	And he brake the withs,
c26368	as a thread of tow is broken
c26369	when it toucheth the fire.
c26370	So his strength was not known.
c26371	And Delilah said unto Samson,
c26372	Behold, thou hast mocked
c26373	me, and told me lies:
c26374	now tell me, I pray thee,
c26375	wherewith thou mightest be bound.
c26376	And he said unto
c26377	her, If they bind me fast with new ropes
c26378	that never were occupied,
c26379	then shall I be weak,
c26380	and be as another man.
c26381	Delilah therefore took new ropes,
c26382	and bound
c26383	him therewith, and said unto
c26384	him, The Philistines <i>be</i> upon
c26385	thee, Samson.
c26386	And <i>there were</i> liers in wait abiding in the chamber.
c26387	And he brake them from off his arms like a thread.
c26388	And Delilah said unto Samson,
c26389	Hitherto thou hast mocked
c26390	me, and told me lies:
c26391	tell
c26392	me wherewith thou mightest be bound.
c26393	And he said unto
c26394	her, If thou weavest the seven locks of my head with the web.
c26395	And she fastened <i>it</i> with the pin,
c26396	and said unto
c26397	him, The Philistines <i>be</i> upon
c26398	thee, Samson.
c26399	And he awaked out of his sleep,
c26400	and went away with the pin of the beam, and with the web.
c26401	And she said unto
c26402	him, How canst thou say,
c26403	I love
c26404	thee, when thine heart <i>is</i> not with
c26405	me? thou hast mocked me these three times,
c26406	and hast not told
c26407	me wherein thy great strength <i>lieth.</i>
c26408	And it came to pass,
c26409	when she pressed him daily with her words,
c26410	and urged
c26411	him, <i>so</i> that his soul was vexed
c26412	unto death;
c26413	That he told her all his heart,
c26414	and said
c26415	unto her, There hath not come a razor upon mine head;
c26416	for I <i>have been</i> a Nazarite unto God from my mother's womb:
c26417	if I be shaven,
c26418	then my strength will go from
c26419	me, and I shall become weak,
c26420	and be like any <i>other</i> man.
c26421	And when Delilah saw
c26422	that he had told her all his heart,
c26423	she sent
c26424	and called for the lords of the Philistines,
c26425	saying,
c26426	Come up this once,
c26427	for he hath shewed me all his heart.
c26428	Then the lords of the Philistines came up unto
c26429	her, and brought money in their hand.
c26430	And she made him sleep upon her knees;
c26431	and she called for a man,
c26432	and she caused him to shave off the seven locks of his head;
c26433	and she began
c26434	to afflict
c26435	him, and his strength went from him.
c26436	And she said,
c26437	The Philistines <i>be</i> upon
c26438	thee, Samson.
c26439	And he awoke out of his sleep,
c26440	and said,
c26441	I will go out as at other times before,
c26442	and shake myself.
c26443	And he wist not
c26444	that the LORD was departed from him.
c26445	But the Philistines took
c26446	him, and put out his eyes,
c26447	and brought him down to Gaza,
c26448	and bound him with fetters of brass;
c26449	and he did grind in the prison house.
c26450	Howbeit the hair of his head began
c26451	to grow again
c26452	after he was shaven.
c26453	Then the lords of the Philistines gathered them together
c26454	for to offer a great sacrifice unto Dagon their god,
c26455	and to rejoice:
c26456	for they said,
c26457	Our god hath delivered Samson our enemy into our hand.
c26458	And when the people saw
c26459	him, they praised their god:
c26460	for they said,
c26461	Our god hath delivered into our hands our enemy, and the destroyer of our country,
c26462	which slew many of us.
c26463	And it came to pass,
c26464	when their hearts were merry,
c26465	that they said,
c26466	Call for Samson,
c26467	that he may make us sport.
c26468	And they called for Samson out of the prison house;
c26469	and he made them sport:
c26470	and they set him between the pillars.
c26471	And Samson said unto the lad
c26472	that held him by the hand,
c26473	Suffer
c26474	me that I may feel the pillars
c26475	whereupon the house standeth,
c26476	that I may lean upon them.
c26477	Now the house was full of men and women; and all the lords of the Philistines <i>were</i> there;
c26479	and <i>there were</i> upon the roof about three thousand men and women,
c26480	that beheld
c26481	while Samson made sport.
c26482	And Samson called unto the LORD,
c26483	and said,
c26484	O Lord GOD,
c26485	remember me, I pray thee,
c26486	and strengthen me, I pray thee, only this once,
c26487	O God,
c26488	that I may be at once avenged of the Philistines for my two eyes.
c26489	And Samson took hold of the two middle pillars
c26490	upon which the house stood,
c26491	and on which it was borne up,
c26492	of the one with his right hand,
c26493	and of the other with his left.
c26494	And Samson said,
c26495	Let me die with the Philistines.
c26496	And he bowed himself with <i>all his</i> might;
c26497	and the house fell upon the lords, and upon all the people
c26498	that
c26499	<i>were</i> therein. So the dead which he slew at his death were
c26501	more
c26502	than <i>they</i> which he slew in his life.
c26503	Then his brethren and all the house of his father came down,
c26504	and took
c26505	him, and brought <i>him</i> up,
c26506	and buried him between Zorah and Eshtaol in the buryingplace of Manoah his father.
c26507	And he judged Israel twenty years.
c26508	And there was a man of mount Ephraim,
c26509	whose name <i>was</i> Micah.
c26510	And he said unto his mother,
c26511	The eleven hundred <i>shekels</i> of silver
c26512	that were taken
c26513	from thee, about which thou cursedst,
c26514	and spakest of also in mine ears,
c26515	behold, the silver <i>is</i> with
c26516	me; I took
c26517	it. And his mother said,
c26518	Blessed <i>be thou</i> of the LORD, my son.
c26519	And when he had restored the eleven hundred <i>shekels</i> of silver to his mother,
c26520	his mother said,
c26521	I had wholly dedicated the silver unto the LORD from my hand for my son,
c26522	to make a graven image and a molten image:
c26523	now therefore I will restore it unto thee.
c26524	Yet he restored the money unto his mother;
c26525	and his mother took two hundred <i>shekels</i> of silver,
c26526	and gave them to the founder,
c26527	who made thereof a graven image and a molten image:
c26528	and they were in the house of Micah.
c26529	And the man Micah
c26530	had an house of gods,
c26531	and made an ephod, and teraphim,
c26532	and consecrated one of his sons,
c26533	who became his priest.
c26534	In those days <i>there was</i> no king in Israel,
c26535	<i>but</i> every man
c26536	<i>that which was</i> right in his own eyes.
c26537	did
c26538	And there was a young man out of Bethlehemjudah of the family of Judah,
c26539	who <i>was</i> a Levite,
c26540	and he sojourned there.
c26541	And the man departed out of the city from Bethlehemjudah
c26542	to sojourn
c26543	where he could find
c26544	<i>a place:</i> and he came to mount Ephraim to the house of Micah,
c26545	as he journeyed.
c26546	And Micah said
c26547	unto him, Whence comest
c26548	thou? And he said unto
c26549	him, I <i>am</i> a Levite of Bethlehemjudah,
c26550	and I go
c26551	to sojourn
c26552	where I may find <i>a place.</i>
c26553	And Micah said
c26554	unto him, Dwell with
c26555	me, and be unto me a father and a priest,
c26556	and I will give thee ten <i>shekels</i> of silver by the year, and a suit of apparel, and thy victuals.
c26557	So the Levite went in.
c26558	And the Levite was content
c26559	to dwell with the man;
c26560	and the young man was unto him as one of his sons.
c26561	And Micah consecrated the Levite;
c26562	and the young man became his priest,
c26563	and was in the house of Micah.
c26564	Then said Micah,
c26565	Now know
c26566	I that the LORD will do me good,
c26567	seeing I have a Levite to <i>my</i> priest.
c26568	In those days <i>there was</i> no king in Israel:
c26569	and in those days the tribe of the Danites sought them an inheritance
c26570	to dwell
c26571	in; for unto that day <i>all their</i> inheritance had not fallen unto them among the tribes of Israel.
c26572	And the children of Dan sent of their family five men from their coasts, men of valour, from Zorah, and from Eshtaol,
c26573	to spy out the land,
c26574	and to search
c26575	it; and they said unto
c26576	them, Go,
c26577	search the land:
c26578	who when they came to mount Ephraim, to the house of Micah,
c26579	they lodged there.
c26580	When they <i>were</i> by the house of Micah,
c26581	they knew the voice of the young man the Levite:
c26582	and they turned in thither,
c26583	and said
c26584	unto him, Who brought thee hither?
c26585	and what makest thou in this
c26586	<i>place?</i> and what hast thou here?
c26587	And he said unto
c26588	them, Thus and thus dealeth Micah
c26589	with me, and hath hired
c26590	me, and I am his priest.
c26591	And they said
c26592	unto him, Ask counsel, we pray thee, of God,
c26593	that we may know
c26594	whether our way which we go shall be prosperous.
c26596	And the priest said
c26597	unto them, Go in peace:
c26598	before the LORD <i>is</i> your way
c26599	wherein ye go.
c26600	Then the five men departed,
c26601	and came to Laish,
c26602	and saw the people
c26603	that <i>were</i> therein,
c26604	how they dwelt careless, after the manner of the Zidonians, quiet and secure;
c26605	and <i>there was</i> no magistrate in the land, that might put <i>them</i> to shame in <i>any</i> thing;
c26607	and they <i>were</i> far from the Zidonians,
c26608	and had no business with <i>any</i> man.
c26609	And they came unto their brethren to Zorah and Eshtaol:
c26610	and their brethren said
c26611	unto them, What <i>say</i> ye?
c26612	And they said,
c26613	Arise,
c26614	that we may go up against
c26615	them: for we have seen the land,
c26616	and, behold, it <i>is</i> very good:
c26617	and <i>are</i> ye still?
c26618	be not slothful
c26619	to go,
c26620	<i>and</i> to enter
c26621	to possess the land.
c26622	When ye go,
c26623	ye shall come unto a people secure,
c26624	and to a large land: for God hath given it into your hands;
c26625	a place
c26626	where <i>there is</i> no want of any thing
c26627	that <i>is</i> in the earth.
c26628	And there went from thence of the family of the Danites, out of Zorah and out of Eshtaol, six hundred men
c26629	appointed with weapons of war.
c26630	And they went up,
c26631	and pitched in Kirjathjearim, in Judah:
c26632	wherefore they called that place Mahanehdan unto this day:
c26633	behold, <i>it is</i> behind Kirjathjearim.
c26634	And they passed thence unto mount Ephraim,
c26635	and came unto the house of Micah.
c26636	Then answered the five men
c26637	that went
c26638	to spy out the country of Laish,
c26639	and said unto their brethren,
c26640	Do ye know
c26641	that there is in these houses an ephod, and teraphim, and a graven image, and a molten image?
c26642	now therefore consider
c26643	what ye have to do.
c26644	And they turned thitherward,
c26645	and came to the house of the young man the Levite, <i>even</i> unto the house of Micah,
c26646	and saluted him.
c26647	And the six hundred men
c26648	appointed with their weapons of war,
c26649	stood by the entering of the gate.
c26650	which <i>were</i> of the children of Dan,
c26651	And the five men that went
c26652	went up,
c26653	to spy out the land
c26654	<i>and</i> came in thither,
c26655	<i>and</i> took the graven image, and the ephod, and the teraphim, and the molten image:
c26656	and the priest stood in the entering of the gate
c26657	with the six hundred men
c26658	<i>that were</i> appointed with weapons of war.
c26659	And these went into Micah's house,
c26660	and fetched the carved image, the ephod, and the teraphim, and the molten image.
c26661	Then said the priest unto
c26662	them, What do ye?
c26663	And they said
c26664	unto him, Hold thy peace,
c26665	lay thine hand upon thy mouth,
c26666	and go with
c26667	us, and be to us a father and a priest:
c26668	<i>is it</i> better
c26669	for thee to be a priest unto the house of one man,
c26670	or that thou be a priest unto a tribe and a family in Israel?
c26671	And the priest's heart was glad,
c26672	and he took the ephod, and the teraphim, and the graven image,
c26673	and went in the midst of the people.
c26674	So they turned
c26675	and departed,
c26676	and put the little ones and the cattle and the carriage before them.
c26677	<i>And</i> when they were a good way from the house of Micah,
c26678	the men
c26679	that <i>were</i> in the houses
c26680	near to Micah's house
c26681	were gathered together,
c26682	and overtook the children of Dan.
c26683	And they cried unto the children of Dan.
c26684	And they turned their faces,
c26685	and said unto Micah,
c26686	What
c26687	aileth thee, that thou comest with such a company?
c26688	And he said,
c26689	my gods
c26690	which I made,
c26691	Ye have taken away
c26692	and the priest,
c26693	and ye are gone away:
c26694	and what have I more?
c26695	and what <i>is</i> this <i>that</i> ye say unto
c26696	me, What aileth thee?
c26697	And the children of Dan said unto
c26698	him, Let not thy voice be heard among
c26699	us, lest angry fellows run
c26700	upon thee, and thou lose thy life, with the lives of thy household.
c26701	And the children of Dan went their way:
c26702	and when Micah saw
c26703	that they <i>were</i> too strong for
c26704	him, he turned
c26705	and went back unto his house.
c26706	And they took
c26707	<i>the things</i> which Micah had made,
c26708	and the priest
c26709	which he had,
c26710	and came unto Laish, unto a people <i>that were</i> at quiet and secure:
c26711	and they smote them with the edge of the sword,
c26712	and burnt the city with fire.
c26713	And <i>there was</i> no deliverer,
c26714	because it <i>was</i> far from Zidon,
c26715	and they had no business with <i>any</i> man;
c26716	and it was in the valley
c26717	that <i>lieth</i> by Bethrehob.
c26718	And they built a city,
c26719	and dwelt therein.
c26720	And they called the name of the city Dan, after the name of Dan their father,
c26721	who was born unto Israel:
c26722	howbeit the name of the city <i>was</i> Laish at the first.
c26723	And the children of Dan set up the graven image:
c26724	and Jonathan, the son of Gershom, the son of Manasseh,
c26725	he and his sons were priests to the tribe of Dan until the day
c26726	of the captivity of the land.
c26727	And they set them up Micah's graven image,
c26728	which he made,
c26729	all the time
c26730	that the house of God was in Shiloh.
c26731	And it came to pass in those days,
c26732	when <i>there was</i> no king in Israel,
c26733	that there was a certain Levite sojourning on the side of mount Ephraim,
c26734	who took to him a concubine out of Bethlehemjudah.
c26735	And his concubine played the whore against
c26736	him, and went away from him unto her father's house to Bethlehemjudah,
c26737	and was there four whole months.
c26738	And her husband arose,
c26739	and went after
c26740	her, to speak friendly
c26741	unto her, <i>and</i> to bring her again,
c26742	having his servant with him, and a couple of asses:
c26743	and she brought him into her father's house:
c26744	and when the father of the damsel saw
c26745	him, he rejoiced
c26746	to meet him.
c26747	And his father in law, the damsel's father, retained
c26748	him; and he abode with him three days:
c26749	so they did eat
c26750	and drink,
c26751	and lodged there.
c26752	And it came to pass on the fourth day,
c26753	when they arose early in the morning,
c26754	that he rose up
c26755	to depart:
c26756	and the damsel's father said unto his son in law,
c26757	Comfort thine heart with a morsel of bread,
c26758	and afterward go your way.
c26759	And they sat down,
c26760	and did eat and drink both of them together:
c26762	for the damsel's father had said unto the man,
c26763	Be content, I pray thee,
c26764	and tarry all night,
c26765	and let thine heart be merry.
c26766	And when the man rose up
c26767	to depart,
c26768	his father in law urged
c26769	again.
c26770	him: therefore he lodged there
c26771	And he arose early in the morning on the fifth day
c26772	to depart:
c26773	and the damsel's father said,
c26774	Comfort thine heart, I pray thee.
c26775	And they tarried
c26776	until afternoon,
c26777	and they did eat both of them.
c26778	And when the man rose up
c26779	to depart,
c26780	he, and his concubine, and his servant,
c26781	his father in law, the damsel's father, said
c26782	unto him, Behold, now the day draweth
c26783	toward evening,
c26784	I pray you tarry all night:
c26785	behold, the day groweth to an end,
c26786	lodge here,
c26787	that thine heart may be merry;
c26788	and to morrow get you early on your way,
c26789	that thou mayest go home.
c26790	But the man would not
c26791	tarry that night,
c26792	but he rose up
c26793	and departed,
c26794	and came over against Jebus,
c26795	which <i>is</i> Jerusalem;
c26796	and <i>there were</i> with him two asses saddled,
c26797	his concubine also <i>was</i> with him.
c26798	<i>And</i> when they <i>were</i> by Jebus,
c26799	the day was far spent;
c26800	and the servant said unto his master,
c26801	Come, I pray thee,
c26802	and let us turn in into this city of the Jebusites,
c26803	and lodge in it.
c26804	And his master said unto
c26805	him, We will not turn aside hither into the city of a stranger,
c26806	that <i>is</i> not of the children of Israel;
c26807	we will pass over to Gibeah.
c26808	And he said unto his servant,
c26809	Come,
c26810	and let us draw near to one of these places
c26811	to lodge all night, in Gibeah, or in Ramah.
c26812	And they passed on
c26813	and went their way;
c26814	and the sun went down upon them <i>when they were</i> by Gibeah,
c26815	which <i>belongeth</i> to Benjamin.
c26816	And they turned aside thither,
c26817	to go in
c26818	<i>and</i> to lodge in Gibeah:
c26819	and when he went in,
c26820	he sat him down in a street of the city:
c26821	for <i>there was</i> no man that took them into his house
c26822	to lodging.
c26823	And, behold, there came an old man from his work out of the field at even,
c26824	which <i>was</i> also of mount Ephraim; and he sojourned in Gibeah: but the men
c26826	of the place <i>were</i> Benjamites.
c26827	And when he had lifted up his eyes,
c26828	he saw a wayfaring man in the street of the city:
c26829	and the old man said,
c26831	Whither goest thou? and whence comest thou?
c26832	And he said unto
c26833	him, We <i>are</i> passing from Bethlehemjudah toward the side of mount Ephraim;
c26834	from thence <i>am</i> I:
c26835	and I went to Bethlehemjudah,
c26836	but I <i>am now</i> going to the house of the LORD;
c26837	and there <i>is</i> no man that receiveth me to house.
c26838	Yet there is both straw and provender for our asses;
c26839	and there is bread and wine also for me, and for thy handmaid, and for the young man <i>which is</i> with thy servants:
c26840	<i>there is</i> no want of any thing.
c26841	And the old man said,
c26842	Peace
c26843	<i>be</i> with thee; howsoever <i>let</i> all thy wants <i>lie</i> upon
c26844	me; only lodge not in the street.
c26845	So he brought him into his house,
c26846	and gave provender unto the asses:
c26847	and they washed their feet,
c26848	and did eat
c26849	and drink.
c26850	<i>Now</i> as they were making their hearts merry,
c26851	behold, the men of the city, certain sons of Belial, beset the house round about,
c26852	<i>and</i> beat at the door,
c26853	and spake to the master of the house, the old man, saying,
c26855	Bring forth the man
c26856	that came into thine house,
c26857	that we may know him.
c26858	And the man, the master of the house, went out unto
c26859	them, and said unto
c26860	them, Nay,
c26861	my brethren,
c26862	<i>nay,</i> I pray you, do not <i>so</i> wickedly;
c26863	seeing that this man is come into mine house,
c26864	do not this folly.
c26865	Behold, <i>here is</i> my daughter a maiden, and his concubine;
c26866	them I will bring out now,
c26867	and humble
c26868	ye them, and do
c26869	with them what seemeth good
c26870	unto you: but unto this man do not so vile a thing.
c26871	to him: so the man took his concubine,
c26872	hearken
c26873	But the men would not
c26874	and brought her forth unto
c26875	them; and they knew
c26876	her, and abused her all the night until the morning:
c26877	they let her go.
c26878	and when the day began to spring,
c26879	Then came the woman
c26880	in the dawning of the day,
c26881	and fell down at the door of the man's house
c26882	where her lord
c26883	<i>was,</i> till it was light.
c26884	And her lord rose up in the morning,
c26885	and opened the doors of the house,
c26886	and went out
c26887	to go his way:
c26888	and, behold, the woman his concubine was fallen down <i>at</i> the door of the house,
c26889	and her hands <i>were</i> upon the threshold.
c26890	And he said unto
c26891	her, Up,
c26892	and let us be going.
c26893	But none answered.
c26894	Then the man took her <i>up</i> upon an ass,
c26895	and the man rose up,
c26896	and gat him unto his place.
c26897	And when he was come into his house,
c26898	he took a knife,
c26899	and laid hold on his concubine,
c26900	and divided her, <i>together</i> with her bones, into twelve pieces,
c26901	and sent her into all the coasts of Israel.
c26902	And it was
c26903	so, that all
c26904	that saw
c26905	it said,
c26906	There was no such deed done
c26907	nor seen from the day
c26908	that the children of Israel came up out of the land of Egypt
c26909	unto this day:
c26910	consider of
c26911	it, take advice,
c26912	and speak <i>your minds.</i>
c26913	Then all the children of Israel went out,
c26914	and the congregation was gathered together as one man, from Dan even to Beersheba, with the land of Gilead, unto the LORD in Mizpeh.
c26915	And the chief of all the people, <i>even</i> of all the tribes of Israel, presented themselves in the assembly of the people of God,
c26916	four hundred thousand footmen
c26917	that drew sword.
c26918	(Now the children of Benjamin heard
c26919	that the children of Israel were gone up to Mizpeh.)
c26920	Then said the children of Israel,
c26921	Tell
c26922	<i>us,</i> how was this wickedness?
c26923	And the Levite, the husband of the woman that was slain, answered
c26924	and said,
c26926	that <i>belongeth</i> to Benjamin, I and my concubine,
c26927	I came into Gibeah
c26928	to lodge.
c26929	And the men of Gibeah rose against
c26930	me, and beset the house round about upon me by night,
c26931	<i>and</i> thought
c26932	to have slain
c26933	me: and my concubine have they forced,
c26934	that she is dead.
c26935	And I took my concubine,
c26936	and cut her in pieces,
c26937	and sent her throughout all the country of the inheritance of Israel:
c26938	for they have committed lewdness and folly in Israel.
c26939	Behold, ye <i>are</i> all children of Israel;
c26940	give here your advice and counsel.
c26941	And all the people arose as one man,
c26942	saying,
c26943	We will not any <i>of us</i> go
c26944	to his tent,
c26945	neither will we any <i>of us</i> turn
c26946	into his house.
c26947	But now
c26948	this <i>shall be</i> the thing
c26949	which we will do to Gibeah;
c26950	<i>we will go up</i> by lot against it;
c26951	And we will take ten men of an hundred throughout all the tribes of Israel, and an hundred of a thousand, and a thousand out of ten thousand,
c26952	to fetch victual for the people,
c26953	that they may do,
c26954	when they come to Gibeah of Benjamin,
c26955	according to all the folly
c26956	that they have wrought in Israel.
c26957	So all the men of Israel were gathered against the city,
c26958	knit together as one man.
c26959	And the tribes of Israel sent men through all the tribe of Benjamin,
c26960	saying,
c26961	What wickedness <i>is</i> this
c26962	that is done among you?
c26963	Now
c26964	therefore deliver <i>us</i> the men, the children of Belial,
c26965	which <i>are</i> in Gibeah,
c26966	that we may put them to death,
c26967	and put away evil from Israel.
c26968	But the children of Benjamin would not
c26969	hearken to the voice of their brethren the children of Israel:
c26970	But the children of Benjamin gathered themselves together out of the cities unto Gibeah,
c26971	to go out to battle against the children of Israel.
c26972	And the children of Benjamin were numbered at that time out of the cities twenty and six thousand men
c26973	that drew sword,
c26974	beside the inhabitants of Gibeah, which were numbered seven hundred chosen men.
c26975	Among all this people <i>there were</i> seven hundred chosen men lefthanded;
c26976	every one could sling stones at an hair
c26977	<i>breadth,</i> and not miss.
c26978	And the men of Israel, beside Benjamin, were numbered four hundred thousand men
c26979	that drew sword:
c26980	all these <i>were</i> men of war.
c26982	and went up to the house of God,
c26983	and asked counsel of God, and said,
c26984	And the children of Israel arose,
c26985	Which of us shall go up first to the battle against the children of Benjamin?
c26986	And the LORD said,
c26987	Judah <i>shall go up</i> first.
c26988	And the children of Israel rose up in the morning,
c26989	and encamped against Gibeah.
c26990	And the men of Israel went out to battle against Benjamin;
c26991	and the men of Israel put themselves in array to fight against them at Gibeah.
c26992	And the children of Benjamin came forth out of Gibeah,
c26993	and destroyed down to the ground of the Israelites that day twenty and two thousand men.
c26994	And the people the men of Israel encouraged themselves,
c26996	and set their battle again in array in the place
c26997	where they put themselves in array the first day.
c26998	(And the children of Israel went up
c26999	and wept before the LORD until even,
c27000	and asked counsel of the LORD,
c27001	saying,
c27003	Shall I go up again to battle against the children of Benjamin my brother?
c27004	And the LORD said,
c27005	Go up against him.)
c27006	And the children of Israel came near against the children of Benjamin the second day.
c27007	And Benjamin went forth
c27008	against
c27009	them out of Gibeah the second day,
c27010	and destroyed down to the ground of the children of Israel again eighteen thousand men;
c27011	all these drew the sword.
c27012	Then all the children of Israel, and all the people, went up,
c27013	and came unto the house of God,
c27014	and wept,
c27015	and sat there before the LORD,
c27016	and fasted that day until even,
c27017	and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before the LORD.
c27018	And the children of Israel enquired of the LORD,
c27019	(for the ark of the covenant of God <i>was</i> there in those days,
c27020	And Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron, stood before it in those days,)
c27021	saying,
c27022	Shall I yet again
c27023	go out to battle against the children of Benjamin my brother,
c27024	or shall I cease?
c27025	And the LORD said,
c27026	Go up;
c27027	for to morrow I will deliver them into thine hand.
c27028	And Israel set liers in wait round about Gibeah.
c27029	And the children of Israel went up against the children of Benjamin on the third day,
c27030	and put themselves in array against Gibeah, as at other times.
c27031	And the children of Benjamin went out
c27032	against the people,
c27033	<i>and</i> were drawn away from the city;
c27034	and they began
c27035	to smite of the people, <i>and</i> kill, as at other times, in the highways,
c27036	of which one goeth up to the house of God,
c27037	and the other to Gibeah
c27038	in the field, about thirty men of Israel.
c27039	And the children of Benjamin said,
c27040	They <i>are</i> smitten down before us, as at the first.
c27041	But the children of Israel said,
c27042	Let us flee,
c27043	and draw them from the city unto the highways.
c27044	And all the men of Israel rose up out of their place,
c27045	and put themselves in array at Baaltamar:
c27046	and the liers in wait of Israel came forth out of their places, <i>even</i> out of the meadows of Gibeah.
c27047	And there came against Gibeah ten thousand chosen men
c27048	out of all Israel,
c27049	and the battle was sore:
c27050	but they knew not
c27051	that evil <i>was</i> near them.
c27052	And the LORD smote Benjamin before Israel:
c27053	and the children of Israel destroyed of the Benjamites that day twenty and five thousand and an hundred men:
c27054	all these drew the sword.
c27055	So the children of Benjamin saw
c27056	that they were smitten:
c27057	for the men of Israel gave place to the Benjamites,
c27058	because they trusted unto the liers in wait
c27059	which they had set beside Gibeah.
c27060	And the liers in wait hasted,
c27061	and rushed upon Gibeah;
c27062	and the liers in wait drew <i>themselves</i> along,
c27063	and smote all the city with the edge of the sword.
c27064	Now there was an appointed sign between the men of Israel and the liers in wait,
c27065	that they should make a great
c27066	flame with smoke rise up out of the city.
c27067	And when the men of Israel retired in the battle,
c27068	Benjamin began
c27069	to smite <i>and</i> kill of the men of Israel about thirty persons:
c27070	for they said,
c27071	Surely they are smitten down before us, as <i>in</i> the first battle.
c27072	But when the flame began
c27073	to arise up out of the city
c27074	with a pillar of smoke,
c27075	the Benjamites looked behind
c27076	them, and, behold,
c27077	the flame of the city ascended up to heaven.
c27078	And when the men of Israel turned again,
c27079	the men of Benjamin were amazed:
c27080	for they saw
c27081	that evil was come upon them.
c27082	Therefore they turned <i>their backs</i> before the men of Israel unto the way of the wilderness;
c27083	but the battle overtook
c27085	them; and them which <i>came</i> out of the cities
c27086	they destroyed in the midst of them.
c27087	<i>Thus</i> they inclosed the Benjamites round about,
c27088	<i>and</i> chased them, <i>and</i> trode them down with ease
c27089	over against Gibeah toward the sunrising.
c27090	And there fell of Benjamin eighteen thousand men;
c27091	all these <i>were</i> men of valour.
c27092	And they turned
c27093	and fled toward the wilderness unto the rock of Rimmon:
c27094	and they gleaned of them in the highways five thousand men;
c27095	and pursued hard after them unto Gidom,
c27096	and slew two thousand men of them.
c27097	So that all which fell
c27098	of Benjamin were
c27099	twenty and five thousand men
c27100	that drew the sword;
c27101	that day
c27102	all these <i>were</i> men of valour.
c27104	But six hundred men turned and fled to the wilderness unto the rock Rimmon,
c27105	and abode in the rock Rimmon four months.
c27106	And the men of Israel turned again upon the children of Benjamin,
c27107	and smote them with the edge of the sword, as well the men of <i>every</i> city, as the beast, and all
c27108	that came to hand:
c27109	also they set on fire all the cities
c27110	that they came to.
c27112	Now the men of Israel had sworn in Mizpeh,
c27113	saying,
c27114	There shall not any of us give his daughter unto Benjamin to wife.
c27115	And the people came to the house of God,
c27116	and abode there till even before God,
c27117	and lifted up their voices,
c27118	and wept sore;
c27119	And said,
c27120	why
c27121	O LORD God of Israel,
c27122	is this come to pass in Israel,
c27123	that there should be to day one tribe lacking in Israel?
c27124	And it came to pass on the morrow,
c27125	that the people rose early,
c27126	and built there an altar,
c27127	and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings.
c27128	And the children of Israel said,
c27129	Who
c27130	<i>is there</i> among all the tribes of Israel that came not up with the congregation unto the LORD?
c27131	For they had made a great oath
c27132	concerning him that came not up to the LORD to Mizpeh,
c27133	saying,
c27134	He shall surely be put to death.
c27135	And the children of Israel repented them for Benjamin their brother,
c27136	and said,
c27137	There is one tribe cut off from Israel this day.
c27138	How shall we do for wives for them that remain,
c27139	seeing we have sworn by the LORD
c27140	that we will not give them of our daughters to wives?
c27141	And they said,
c27142	What one <i>is there</i> of the tribes of Israel
c27143	that came not up to Mizpeh to the LORD?
c27144	And, behold,
c27145	there came none to the camp from Jabeshgilead to the assembly.
c27146	For the people were numbered,
c27147	and, behold,
c27148	<i>there were</i> none of the inhabitants of Jabeshgilead there.
c27149	And the congregation sent thither twelve thousand men of the valiantest,
c27150	and commanded
c27151	them, saying,
c27152	Go
c27153	and smite the inhabitants of Jabeshgilead with the edge of the sword, with the women and the children.
c27154	And this <i>is</i> the thing
c27155	that ye shall do,
c27156	every male, and every woman
c27157	that hath lain by man.
c27158	Ye shall utterly destroy
c27159	And they found among the inhabitants of Jabeshgilead four hundred young virgins,
c27160	that had known no man by lying with any male:
c27161	and they brought them unto the camp to Shiloh,
c27162	which <i>is</i> in the land of Canaan.
c27163	And the whole congregation sent
c27164	<i>some</i> to speak to the children of Benjamin
c27165	that <i>were</i> in the rock Rimmon,
c27166	and to call peaceably unto them.
c27167	And Benjamin came again at that time;
c27168	and they gave them wives
c27169	which they had saved alive of the women of Jabeshgilead:
c27170	and yet so they sufficed them not.
c27171	And the people repented them for Benjamin,
c27172	because that the LORD had made a breach in the tribes of Israel.
c27173	Then the elders of the congregation said,
c27174	How shall we do for wives for them that remain,
c27175	seeing the women are destroyed out of Benjamin?
c27176	And they said,
c27177	<i>There must be</i> an inheritance for them that be escaped of Benjamin,
c27178	that a tribe be not destroyed out of Israel.
c27179	Howbeit we may not
c27180	give them wives of our daughters:
c27181	for the children of Israel have sworn,
c27182	saying,
c27183	Cursed
c27184	<i>be</i> he that giveth a wife to Benjamin.
c27185	Then they said,
c27186	Behold, <i>there is</i> a feast of the LORD in Shiloh yearly
c27187	<i>in a place</i> which <i>is</i> on the north side of Bethel, on the east side of the highway
c27188	that goeth up from Bethel to Shechem, and on the south of Lebonah.
c27189	Therefore they commanded the children of Benjamin,
c27190	saying,
c27191	Go
c27192	and lie in wait in the vineyards;
c27193	And see,
c27194	and, behold,
c27195	if the daughters of Shiloh come out
c27196	to dance in dances,
c27197	then come ye out of the vineyards,
c27198	and catch you every man his wife of the daughters of Shiloh,
c27199	and go to the land of Benjamin.
c27200	And it shall be,
c27201	when their fathers or their brethren come
c27202	unto us to complain,
c27203	that we will say unto
c27204	them, Be favourable
c27205	unto them for our sakes: because we reserved not to each man his wife in the war:
c27206	for ye did not give unto them at this time,
c27207	<i>that</i> ye should be guilty.
c27208	And the children of Benjamin did so,
c27209	and took <i>them</i> wives, according to their number, of them that danced,
c27210	whom they caught:
c27211	and they went
c27212	and returned unto their inheritance,
c27213	and repaired the cities,
c27214	and dwelt in them.
c27215	And the children of Israel departed thence at that time,
c27216	every man to his tribe and to his family,
c27217	and they went out from thence
c27218	every man to his inheritance.
c27219	In those days <i>there was</i> no king in Israel:
c27220	every man
c27221	<i>that which was</i> right in his own eyes.
c27222	did
c27223	Now there was a certain man of Ramathaimzophim, of mount Ephraim,
c27224	and his name <i>was</i> Elkanah, the son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephrathite:
c27225	And he had two wives;
c27226	the name of the one <i>was</i> Hannah,
c27227	and the name of the other Peninnah:
c27229	and Peninnah had children,
c27230	but Hannah had no children.
c27231	And this man went up out of his city yearly
c27232	to worship
c27233	and to sacrifice unto the LORD of hosts in Shiloh.
c27234	And the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, the priests of the LORD, <i>were</i> there.
c27235	And when the time was
c27236	that Elkanah offered,
c27237	he gave to Peninnah his wife, and to all her sons and her daughters, portions:
c27238	But unto Hannah he gave a worthy portion;
c27239	for he loved Hannah:
c27240	but the LORD had shut up her womb.
c27241	And her adversary also provoked her sore,
c27242	for to make her fret,
c27243	because the LORD had shut up her womb.
c27244	And <i>as</i> he did so year by year,
c27245	when she went up to the house of the LORD,
c27246	so she provoked
c27247	her; therefore she wept,
c27248	and did not eat.
c27249	Then said Elkanah her husband
c27250	to her, Hannah,
c27251	why weepest
c27252	thou? and why eatest thou not?
c27253	and why is thy heart grieved?
c27254	<i>am</i> not I better to thee than ten sons?
c27255	So Hannah rose up
c27256	after they had eaten in Shiloh,
c27257	and after they had drunk.
c27258	Now Eli the priest sat upon a seat by a post of the temple of the LORD.
c27259	And she <i>was</i> in bitterness of soul,
c27260	and prayed unto the LORD,
c27261	and wept sore.
c27262	And she vowed a vow,
c27263	and said,
c27264	O LORD of hosts,
c27265	if thou wilt indeed look on the affliction of thine handmaid,
c27266	and remember
c27267	me, and not forget thine handmaid,
c27268	but wilt give unto thine handmaid a man child,
c27269	then I will give him unto the LORD all the days of his life,
c27270	and there shall no razor come upon his head.
c27271	And it came to pass,
c27272	as she continued
c27273	praying before the LORD,
c27274	that Eli marked her mouth.
c27275	Now Hannah,
c27276	she spake in her heart;
c27277	only her lips moved,
c27278	but her voice was not heard:
c27279	therefore Eli thought she had been drunken.
c27280	And Eli said unto
c27281	her, How long wilt thou be drunken?
c27282	put away thy wine from thee.
c27283	And Hannah answered
c27284	and said,
c27285	No,
c27286	my lord,
c27287	I <i>am</i> a woman of a sorrowful spirit: I
c27288	have drunk neither wine nor strong drink,
c27289	but have poured out my soul before the LORD.
c27290	Count not thine handmaid for a daughter of Belial:
c27291	for out of the abundance of my complaint and grief have I spoken hitherto.
c27292	Then Eli answered
c27293	and said,
c27294	Go in peace:
c27295	and the God of Israel grant <i>thee</i> thy petition
c27296	that thou hast asked of him.
c27297	And she said,
c27298	Let thine handmaid find grace in thy sight.
c27299	So the woman went her way,
c27300	and did eat,
c27301	and her countenance was no more <i>sad.</i>
c27302	And they rose up in the morning early,
c27303	and worshipped before the LORD,
c27304	and returned,
c27305	and came to their house to Ramah:
c27306	and Elkanah knew Hannah his wife;
c27307	and the LORD remembered her.
c27308	Wherefore it came to pass, when the time was come
c27309	about after Hannah had conceived,
c27310	that she bare a son,
c27311	and called his name Samuel,
c27312	<i>saying,</i> Because I have asked him of the LORD.
c27313	And the man Elkanah, and all his house, went up
c27314	to offer unto the LORD the yearly sacrifice, and his vow.
c27315	But Hannah went not up;
c27316	for she said unto her husband,
c27317	<i>I will not go up</i> until the child be weaned,
c27318	and <i>then</i> I will bring
c27319	him, that he may appear before the LORD,
c27320	and there abide for ever.
c27321	And Elkanah her husband said
c27322	unto her, Do
c27323	what seemeth thee good;
c27324	tarry
c27325	until thou have weaned
c27326	him; only the LORD establish his word.
c27327	So the woman abode,
c27328	and gave her son suck
c27329	until she weaned him.
c27330	him, she took him up with
c27331	And when she had weaned
c27332	her, with three bullocks, and one ephah of flour, and a bottle of wine,
c27333	and brought him unto the house of the LORD in Shiloh:
c27334	and the child <i>was</i> young.
c27335	And they slew a bullock,
c27336	and brought the child to Eli.
c27337	And she said,
c27338	Oh my lord,
c27339	<i>as</i> thy soul liveth,
c27340	my lord,
c27341	I <i>am</i> the woman
c27342	that stood by thee here,
c27343	praying unto the LORD.
c27344	For this child I prayed;
c27345	and the LORD hath given me my petition
c27346	which I asked of him:
c27347	Therefore also I have lent him to the LORD; as long as he liveth
c27348	he shall be lent to the LORD.
c27349	And he worshipped the LORD there.
c27350	And Hannah prayed,
c27351	and said,
c27352	My heart rejoiceth in the LORD,
c27353	mine horn is exalted in the LORD:
c27354	my mouth is enlarged over mine enemies;
c27355	because I rejoice in thy salvation.
c27356	<i>There is</i> none holy as the LORD:
c27357	for <i>there is</i> none beside
c27358	thee: neither <i>is there</i> any rock like our God.
c27360	Talk no more so exceeding proudly;
c27361	let <i>not</i> arrogancy come out of your mouth:
c27362	for the LORD <i>is</i> a God of knowledge,
c27363	and by him actions are weighed.
c27364	The bows of the mighty men <i>are</i> broken,
c27365	and they that stumbled are girded with strength.
c27366	<i>They that were</i> full have hired out themselves for bread;
c27367	and <i>they that were</i> hungry ceased:
c27368	so that the barren hath born seven;
c27369	and she that hath many children is waxed feeble.
c27370	The LORD killeth,
c27371	and maketh alive:
c27372	he bringeth down to the grave,
c27373	and bringeth up.
c27374	The LORD maketh poor,
c27375	and maketh rich:
c27376	he bringeth low,
c27377	and lifteth up.
c27378	He raiseth up the poor out of the dust,
c27379	<i>and</i> lifteth up the beggar from the dunghill,
c27380	to set <i>them</i> among princes,
c27381	and to make them inherit the throne of glory:
c27382	for the pillars of the earth <i>are</i> the LORD'S,
c27383	and he hath set the world upon them.
c27384	He will keep the feet of his saints,
c27385	and the wicked shall be silent in darkness;
c27386	for by strength shall no man prevail.
c27388	The adversaries of the LORD shall be broken to pieces;
c27389	out of heaven shall he thunder upon
c27390	them: the LORD shall judge the ends of the earth;
c27391	and he shall give strength unto his king,
c27392	and exalt the horn of his anointed.
c27393	And Elkanah went to Ramah to his house.
c27394	And the child did minister unto the LORD before Eli the priest.
c27395	Now the sons of Eli <i>were</i> sons of Belial;
c27396	they knew not the LORD.
c27397	And the priests' custom with the people
c27398	<i>was, that,</i> when any man
c27399	offered sacrifice,
c27400	the priest's servant came,
c27401	while the flesh was in seething,
c27402	with a fleshhook of three teeth in his hand;
c27403	And he struck <i>it</i> into the pan, or kettle, or caldron, or pot;
c27404	all
c27405	that the fleshhook brought up
c27406	the priest took
c27407	for himself. So they did in Shiloh unto all the Israelites
c27408	that came thither.
c27409	Also before they burnt the fat,
c27410	the priest's servant came,
c27411	and said to the man that sacrificed,
c27412	Give flesh
c27413	to roast for the priest;
c27414	for he will not have sodden flesh of
c27415	thee, but raw.
c27416	And <i>if</i> any man said unto
c27417	him, Let them not fail to burn the fat presently,
c27418	and <i>then</i> take
c27419	<i>as much</i> as thy soul desireth;
c27420	then he would answer
c27421	him, <i>Nay;</i>
c27422	but thou shalt give <i>it me</i> now:
c27423	and if not,
c27424	I will take <i>it</i> by force.
c27425	Wherefore the sin of the young men was very great before the LORD:
c27426	for men abhorred the offering of the LORD.
c27427	But Samuel ministered before the LORD, <i>being</i> a child,
c27428	girded with a linen ephod.
c27429	Moreover his mother made him a little coat,
c27430	and brought <i>it</i> to him from year to year,
c27431	when she came up with her husband
c27432	to offer the yearly sacrifice.
c27433	And Eli blessed Elkanah and his wife,
c27434	and said,
c27435	The LORD give thee seed of this woman for the loan
c27436	which is lent to the LORD.
c27437	And they went unto their own home.
c27438	And the LORD visited Hannah,
c27439	so that she conceived,
c27440	and bare three sons and two daughters.
c27441	And the child Samuel grew before the LORD.
c27442	Now Eli was very old,
c27443	and heard all
c27444	that his sons did unto all Israel;
c27445	and how they lay with the women
c27446	that assembled <i>at</i> the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.
c27447	And he said
c27448	unto them, Why do ye such things?
c27449	for I hear of your evil dealings by all this people.
c27451	Nay,
c27452	my sons;
c27453	for <i>it is</i> no good report
c27454	that I hear:
c27455	ye make the LORD'S people to transgress.
c27456	If one man sin against another,
c27457	the judge shall judge
c27458	him: but if a man sin against the LORD,
c27459	who shall intreat
c27460	for him? Notwithstanding they hearkened not unto the voice of their father,
c27461	because the LORD would
c27462	slay them.
c27463	And the child Samuel grew
c27464	on,
c27465	and was in favour both with the LORD, and also with men.
c27466	And there came a man of God unto Eli,
c27467	and said unto
c27468	him, Thus saith the LORD,
c27469	Did I plainly appear unto the house of thy father,
c27470	when they were in Egypt in Pharaoh's house?
c27471	And did I choose him out of all the tribes of Israel <i>to be</i> my priest,
c27472	to offer upon mine altar,
c27473	to burn incense,
c27474	to wear an ephod before
c27475	me? and did I give unto the house of thy father all the offerings made by fire of the children of Israel?
c27476	Wherefore kick ye at my sacrifice and at mine offering,
c27477	which I have commanded <i>in my</i> habitation;
c27478	and honourest thy sons above
c27479	me, to make yourselves fat with the chiefest of all the offerings of Israel my people?
c27480	Wherefore the LORD God of Israel saith,
c27481	I said indeed
c27482	<i>that</i> thy house, and the house of thy father, should walk before me for ever:
c27483	but now the LORD saith,
c27484	Be it far
c27485	from me; for them that honour me I will honour,
c27486	and they that despise me shall be lightly esteemed.
c27487	Behold, the days come,
c27488	that I will cut off thine arm, and the arm of thy father's house,
c27489	that there shall not be an old man in thine house.
c27490	And thou shalt see an enemy <i>in my</i> habitation, in all
c27491	<i>the wealth</i> which <i>God</i> shall give Israel:
c27492	and there shall not be an old man in thine house for ever.
c27493	And the man of thine, <i>whom</i> I shall not cut off from mine altar,
c27494	<i>shall be</i> to consume thine eyes,
c27495	and to grieve thine heart:
c27496	and all the increase of thine house shall die in the flower of their age.
c27497	And this <i>shall be</i> a sign
c27498	unto thee, that shall come upon thy two sons, on Hophni and Phinehas;
c27499	in one day they shall die both of them.
c27500	And I will raise me up a faithful priest,
c27501	according to <i>that</i> which <i>is</i> in mine heart and in my mind:
c27502	<i>that</i> shall do
c27503	and I will build him a sure house;
c27504	and he shall walk before mine anointed for ever.
c27505	And it shall come to pass,
c27506	<i>that</i> every one
c27507	that is left in thine house
c27508	shall come
c27509	<i>and</i> crouch to him for a piece of silver and a morsel of bread,
c27510	and shall say,
c27511	Put me, I pray thee, into one of the priests' offices,
c27512	that I may eat a piece of bread.
c27513	And the child Samuel ministered unto the LORD before Eli.
c27514	And the word of the LORD was precious in those days;
c27515	<i>there was</i> no open vision.
c27516	And it came to pass at that time, when
c27517	Eli <i>was</i> laid down in his place,
c27518	and his eyes began
c27519	to wax dim,
c27520	<i>that</i> he could not
c27521	see;
c27522	And ere the lamp of God went out
c27523	in the temple of the LORD, where the ark of God <i>was,</i> and Samuel was laid down <i>to sleep;</i>
c27525	That the LORD called Samuel:
c27526	and he answered,
c27527	Here <i>am</i> I.
c27528	And he ran unto Eli,
c27529	and said,
c27530	Here
c27531	<i>am</i> I; for thou calledst
c27532	me. And he said,
c27533	I called not;
c27534	again.
c27535	lie down
c27536	And he went
c27537	and lay down.
c27538	And the LORD called yet again,
c27539	Samuel.
c27540	And Samuel arose
c27541	and went to Eli,
c27542	and said,
c27543	Here
c27544	<i>am</i> I; for thou didst call
c27545	me. And he answered,
c27546	I called not,
c27547	my son;
c27548	again.
c27549	lie down
c27550	Now Samuel did not yet know the LORD,
c27551	neither was the word of the LORD yet revealed unto him.
c27552	And the LORD called Samuel again
c27554	the third
c27555	time. And he arose
c27556	and went to Eli,
c27557	and said,
c27558	Here
c27559	<i>am</i> I; for thou didst call
c27560	me. And Eli perceived
c27561	that the LORD had called the child.
c27562	Therefore Eli said unto Samuel,
c27563	Go,
c27564	lie down:
c27565	and it shall be,
c27566	if he call
c27567	thee, that thou shalt say,
c27568	Speak,
c27569	LORD;
c27570	for thy servant heareth.
c27571	So Samuel went
c27572	and lay down in his place.
c27573	And the LORD came,
c27574	and stood,
c27575	and called as at other times,
c27576	Samuel, Samuel.
c27577	Then Samuel answered,
c27578	Speak;
c27579	for thy servant heareth.
c27580	And the LORD said to Samuel,
c27581	Behold, I will do a thing in Israel,
c27582	at which both the ears of every one
c27583	that heareth
c27584	it shall tingle.
c27585	In that day I will perform against Eli all
c27586	<i>things</i> which I have spoken concerning his house:
c27587	when I begin,
c27588	I will also make an end.
c27589	For I have told
c27590	him that I will judge his house for ever for the iniquity
c27591	which he knoweth;
c27592	because his sons made themselves vile,
c27593	and he restrained them not.
c27594	And therefore I have sworn unto the house of Eli,
c27595	that the iniquity of Eli's house shall not be purged with sacrifice nor offering for ever.
c27596	And Samuel lay until the morning,
c27597	and opened the doors of the house of the LORD.
c27598	And Samuel feared
c27599	to shew Eli the vision.
c27600	Then Eli called Samuel,
c27601	and said,
c27602	Samuel, my son.
c27603	And he answered,
c27604	Here <i>am</i> I.
c27605	And he said,
c27606	What <i>is</i> the thing
c27607	that <i>the LORD</i> hath said unto
c27608	thee? I pray thee hide <i>it</i> not from
c27609	me: God do so
c27610	to thee, and more also,
c27611	if thou hide <i>any</i> thing from me of all the things
c27612	that he said unto thee.
c27613	And Samuel told him every whit,
c27614	and hid nothing from
c27615	him. And he said,
c27616	<i>is</i> the LORD:
c27617	It
c27618	what seemeth him good.
c27619	let him do
c27620	And Samuel grew,
c27621	and the LORD was with
c27622	him, and did let none of his words fall to the ground.
c27623	And all Israel from Dan even to Beersheba knew
c27624	that Samuel <i>was</i> established <i>to be</i> a prophet of the LORD.
c27625	And the LORD appeared again
c27626	in Shiloh:
c27627	for the LORD revealed himself to Samuel in Shiloh by the word of the LORD.
c27628	And the word of Samuel came to all Israel.
c27629	Now Israel went out
c27630	against the Philistines to battle,
c27631	and pitched beside Ebenezer:
c27632	and the Philistines pitched in Aphek.
c27633	And the Philistines put themselves in array
c27634	against Israel:
c27635	and when they joined battle,
c27636	Israel was smitten before the Philistines:
c27637	and they slew of the army in the field about four thousand men.
c27638	And when the people were come into the camp,
c27639	the elders of Israel said,
c27640	Wherefore hath the LORD smitten us to day before the Philistines?
c27641	Let us fetch the ark of the covenant of the LORD out of Shiloh unto
c27642	us, that, when it cometh among
c27643	us, it may save us out of the hand of our enemies.
c27644	So the people sent to Shiloh,
c27645	that they might bring from thence the ark of the covenant of the LORD of hosts,
c27646	which dwelleth <i>between</i> the cherubims:
c27647	and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, <i>were</i> there with the ark of the covenant of God.
c27649	And when the ark of the covenant of the LORD came into the camp,
c27650	all Israel shouted with a great shout,
c27651	so that the earth rang again.
c27652	And when the Philistines heard the noise of the shout,
c27653	they said,
c27654	What <i>meaneth</i> the noise of this great shout in the camp of the Hebrews?
c27655	And they understood
c27656	that the ark of the LORD was come into the camp.
c27657	And the Philistines were afraid,
c27658	for they said,
c27659	God is come into the camp.
c27660	And they said,
c27661	Woe
c27662	unto us! for there hath not been such a thing heretofore.
c27663	Woe
c27664	unto us! who shall deliver us out of the hand of these mighty Gods?
c27665	these
c27666	<i>are</i> the Gods
c27667	that smote the Egyptians with all the plagues in the wilderness.
c27668	Be strong,
c27669	and quit yourselves like men,
c27670	O ye Philistines,
c27671	that ye be not servants unto the Hebrews,
c27672	as they have been
c27673	to you: quit yourselves like men,
c27674	and fight.
c27675	And the Philistines fought,
c27676	and Israel was smitten,
c27677	and they fled
c27678	every man into his tent:
c27679	and there was a very great slaughter;
c27680	for there fell of Israel thirty thousand footmen.
c27681	And the ark of God was taken;
c27682	and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were slain.
c27683	And there ran a man of Benjamin out of the army,
c27684	and came to Shiloh the same day
c27685	with his clothes rent,
c27686	and with earth upon his head.
c27687	And when he came,
c27688	lo,
c27689	Eli sat upon a seat by the wayside
c27690	watching:
c27691	for his heart trembled for the ark of God.
c27692	And when the man came
c27693	into the city, and told
c27694	<i>it,</i> all the city cried out.
c27695	And when Eli heard the noise of the crying,
c27696	he said,
c27697	What <i>meaneth</i> the noise of this tumult?
c27698	And the man came in hastily,
c27700	and told Eli.
c27701	Now Eli was ninety and eight years old;
c27702	and his eyes were dim,
c27703	that he could not
c27704	see.
c27705	And the man said unto Eli,
c27706	I
c27707	<i>am</i> he that came out of the army,
c27708	and I fled to day out of the army.
c27709	And he said,
c27710	What is there done,
c27711	my son?
c27712	And the messenger answered
c27713	and said,
c27714	Israel is fled before the Philistines,
c27715	and there hath been also a great slaughter among the people,
c27716	and thy two sons also, Hophni and Phinehas, are dead,
c27717	and the ark of God is taken.
c27718	And it came to pass,
c27719	when he made mention of the ark of God,
c27720	that he fell from off the seat backward by the side of the gate,
c27721	and his neck brake,
c27722	and he died:
c27723	for he was an old man,
c27724	and heavy.
c27725	And he had judged Israel forty years.
c27726	And his daughter in law, Phinehas' wife, was with child,
c27727	<i>near</i> to be delivered:
c27728	and when she heard the tidings
c27729	that the ark of God was taken,
c27730	and that her father in law and her husband were dead,
c27731	she bowed herself
c27732	and travailed;
c27733	for her pains came upon her.
c27734	And about the time of her death
c27736	the women that stood by her said unto
c27737	her, Fear not;
c27738	for thou hast born a son.
c27739	But she answered not,
c27740	neither did she regard <i>it.</i>
c27741	And she named the child Ichabod,
c27742	saying,
c27743	The glory is departed from Israel:
c27744	because the ark of God was taken,
c27745	and because of her father in law and her husband.
c27746	And she said,
c27747	The glory is departed from Israel:
c27748	for the ark of God is taken.
c27749	And the Philistines took the ark of God,
c27750	and brought it from Ebenezer unto Ashdod.
c27751	When the Philistines took the ark of God,
c27752	they brought it into the house of Dagon,
c27753	and set it by Dagon.
c27754	And when they of Ashdod arose early on the morrow,
c27755	behold,
c27756	Dagon <i>was</i> fallen upon his face to the earth before the ark of the LORD.
c27757	And they took Dagon,
c27758	and set him in his place again.
c27759	And when they arose early on the morrow morning,
c27760	behold,
c27761	Dagon <i>was</i> fallen upon his face to the ground before the ark of the LORD;
c27762	and the head of Dagon and both the palms of his hands <i>were</i> cut off upon the threshold;
c27763	only <i>the stump of</i> Dagon was left to him.
c27764	Therefore neither the priests of Dagon, nor any that come into Dagon's house, tread
c27766	on the threshold of Dagon in Ashdod unto this day.
c27767	But the hand of the LORD was heavy upon them of Ashdod,
c27768	and he destroyed
c27769	them, and smote them with emerods, <i>even</i> Ashdod and the coasts thereof.
c27770	And when the men of Ashdod saw
c27771	that <i>it was</i> so,
c27772	they said,
c27773	The ark of the God of Israel shall not abide with
c27774	us: for his hand is sore upon us, and upon Dagon our god.
c27775	They sent
c27776	therefore and gathered all the lords of the Philistines unto
c27777	them, and said,
c27778	What shall we do with the ark of the God of Israel?
c27779	And they answered,
c27780	Let the ark of the God of Israel be carried about unto Gath.
c27781	And they carried the ark of the God of Israel about <i>thither.</i>
c27782	And it was
c27783	<i>so,</i> that, after they had carried it about,
c27784	the hand of the LORD was against the city
c27785	with a very great destruction:
c27786	and he smote the men of the city, both small and great,
c27787	and they had emerods in their secret parts.
c27788	Therefore they sent the ark of God to Ekron.
c27789	And it came to pass,
c27790	as the ark of God came to Ekron,
c27791	that the Ekronites cried out,
c27792	saying,
c27793	They have brought about the ark of the God of Israel to
c27794	us, to slay
c27795	us and our people.
c27796	So they sent
c27797	and gathered together all the lords of the Philistines,
c27798	and said,
c27799	Send away the ark of the God of Israel,
c27800	and let it go again to his own place,
c27801	that it slay us not, and our people:
c27802	for there was a deadly destruction throughout all the city;
c27803	the hand of God was very heavy there.
c27804	And the men
c27805	that died not
c27806	were smitten with the emerods:
c27807	and the cry of the city went up to heaven.
c27808	And the ark of the LORD was in the country of the Philistines seven months.
c27809	And the Philistines called for the priests and the diviners,
c27810	saying,
c27811	What shall we do to the ark of the LORD?
c27812	tell
c27813	us wherewith we shall send it to his place.
c27814	And they said,
c27815	If ye send away the ark of the God of Israel,
c27816	send it not empty;
c27817	but in any wise return him a trespass offering:
c27818	then ye shall be healed,
c27819	and it shall be known
c27820	to you why his hand is not removed from you.
c27821	Then said
c27822	they, What <i>shall be</i> the trespass offering
c27823	which we shall return
c27824	to him? They answered,
c27825	Five golden emerods, and five golden mice, <i>according to</i> the number of the lords of the Philistines:
c27826	for one plague <i>was</i> on you all, and on your lords.
c27827	Wherefore ye shall make images of your emerods, and images of your mice
c27828	that mar the land;
c27829	and ye shall give glory unto the God of Israel:
c27830	peradventure he will lighten his hand from off you, and from off your gods, and from off your land.
c27831	Wherefore then do ye harden your hearts,
c27832	as the Egyptians and Pharaoh hardened their hearts?
c27833	among them, did they not
c27834	when he had wrought wonderfully
c27835	let the people go,
c27836	and they departed?
c27837	Now
c27838	and take
c27839	therefore make a new cart,
c27840	two milch kine,
c27841	on which there hath come no yoke,
c27842	and tie the kine to the cart,
c27843	and bring their calves home from them:
c27844	And take the ark of the LORD,
c27845	and lay it upon the cart;
c27847	which ye return him <i>for</i> a trespass offering, in a coffer by the side
c27848	and put the jewels of gold,
c27849	thereof; and send it away,
c27850	that it may go.
c27851	And see,
c27852	if it goeth up by the way of his own coast to Bethshemesh,
c27853	<i>then</i> he hath done us this great evil:
c27854	but if not,
c27855	then we shall know
c27856	that <i>it is</i> not his hand <i>that</i> smote
c27858	us: it <i>was</i> a chance <i>that</i> happened to us.
c27859	And the men did so;
c27860	and took two milch kine,
c27861	and tied them to the cart,
c27862	and shut up their calves at home:
c27863	And they laid the ark of the LORD upon the cart, and the coffer with the mice of gold and the images of their emerods.
c27864	And the kine took the straight way to the way of Bethshemesh,
c27865	<i>and</i> went along the highway, lowing as they went,
c27866	and turned not aside <i>to</i> the right hand or <i>to</i> the left;
c27867	and the lords of the Philistines went after them unto the border of Bethshemesh.
c27868	And <i>they of</i> Bethshemesh <i>were</i> reaping their wheat harvest in the valley:
c27869	and they lifted up their eyes,
c27870	and saw the ark,
c27871	and rejoiced
c27872	to see <i>it.</i>
c27873	And the cart came into the field of Joshua, a Bethshemite,
c27874	and stood there,
c27875	where <i>there was</i> a great stone:
c27876	and they clave the wood of the cart,
c27877	and offered the kine a burnt offering unto the LORD.
c27878	And the Levites took down the ark of the LORD, and the coffer
c27879	that <i>was</i> with
c27880	it, wherein the jewels of gold
c27881	<i>were,</i> and put <i>them</i> on the great stone:
c27882	and the men of Bethshemesh offered burnt offerings
c27883	and sacrificed sacrifices the same day unto the LORD.
c27884	And when the five lords of the Philistines had seen
c27885	<i>it,</i> they returned to Ekron the same day.
c27886	And these <i>are</i> the golden emerods
c27887	which the Philistines returned <i>for</i> a trespass offering unto the LORD;
c27888	for Ashdod one,
c27889	for Gaza one,
c27890	for Askelon one,
c27891	for Gath one,
c27892	for Ekron one;
c27893	And the golden mice, <i>according to</i> the number of all the cities of the Philistines <i>belonging</i> to the five lords, <i>both</i> of fenced cities, and of country villages, even unto the great <i>stone of</i> Abel,
c27894	whereon they set down the ark of the LORD: <i>which stone remaineth</i> unto this day
c27895	in the field of Joshua, the Bethshemite.
c27896	And he smote the men of Bethshemesh,
c27897	because they had looked into the ark of the LORD,
c27898	even he smote of the people fifty thousand and threescore and ten men:
c27899	and the people lamented,
c27900	because the LORD had smitten <i>many</i> of the people with a great slaughter.
c27901	And the men of Bethshemesh said,
c27902	Who is able
c27903	to stand before this holy LORD God?
c27904	and to whom shall he go up from us?
c27905	And they sent messengers to the inhabitants of Kirjathjearim,
c27906	saying,
c27907	The Philistines have brought again the ark of the LORD;
c27908	come ye down,
c27909	<i>and</i> fetch it up to you.
c27910	And the men of Kirjathjearim came,
c27911	and fetched up the ark of the LORD,
c27912	and brought it into the house of Abinadab in the hill,
c27913	and sanctified Eleazar his son
c27914	to keep the ark of the LORD.
c27915	And it came to pass, while
c27916	the ark abode in Kirjathjearim,
c27917	that the time was long;
c27918	for it was twenty years:
c27919	and all the house of Israel lamented after the LORD.
c27920	And Samuel spake unto all the house of Israel,
c27921	saying,
c27922	If ye do return unto the LORD with all your hearts,
c27923	<i>then</i> put away the strange gods and Ashtaroth from among
c27924	you, and prepare your hearts unto the LORD,
c27925	and serve him only:
c27926	and he will deliver you out of the hand of the Philistines.
c27927	Then the children of Israel did put away Baalim and Ashtaroth,
c27928	and served the LORD only.
c27929	And Samuel said,
c27930	Gather all Israel to Mizpeh,
c27931	and I will pray for you unto the LORD.
c27932	And they gathered together to Mizpeh,
c27933	and drew water,
c27934	and poured <i>it</i> out before the LORD,
c27935	and fasted on that day,
c27936	and said there,
c27937	We have sinned against the LORD.
c27938	And Samuel judged the children of Israel in Mizpeh.
c27939	And when the Philistines heard
c27940	that the children of Israel were gathered together to Mizpeh,
c27941	the lords of the Philistines went up against Israel.
c27942	And when the children of Israel heard
c27943	<i>it,</i> they were afraid of the Philistines.
c27944	And the children of Israel said to Samuel,
c27945	Cease not to cry
c27946	unto the LORD our God for
c27947	us, that he will save us out of the hand of the Philistines.
c27948	And Samuel took a sucking lamb,
c27949	and offered <i>it for</i> a burnt offering wholly unto the LORD:
c27950	and Samuel cried unto the LORD for Israel;
c27951	and the LORD heard him.
c27953	And as Samuel was offering up the burnt offering,
c27954	the Philistines drew near to battle against Israel:
c27955	but the LORD thundered with a great thunder on that day upon the Philistines,
c27956	and discomfited
c27957	them; and they were smitten before Israel.
c27958	And the men of Israel went out of Mizpeh,
c27959	and pursued the Philistines,
c27960	and smote them, until <i>they came</i> under Bethcar.
c27961	Then Samuel took a stone,
c27962	and set <i>it</i> between Mizpeh and Shen,
c27963	and called the name of it Ebenezer,
c27964	saying,
c27965	Hitherto hath the LORD helped us.
c27966	So the Philistines were subdued,
c27968	and they came no more into the coast of Israel:
c27969	and the hand of the LORD was against the Philistines all the days of Samuel.
c27970	And the cities which the Philistines had taken from Israel were restored
c27972	to Israel, from Ekron even unto Gath;
c27973	and the coasts thereof did Israel deliver out of the hands of the Philistines.
c27974	And there was peace between Israel and the Amorites.
c27975	And Samuel judged Israel all the days of his life.
c27976	And he went from year to year
c27977	in circuit to Bethel, and Gilgal, and Mizpeh,
c27978	and judged Israel in all those places.
c27979	And his return <i>was</i> to Ramah;
c27980	for there <i>was</i> his house;
c27981	and there he judged Israel;
c27982	and there he built an altar unto the LORD.
c27983	And it came to pass,
c27984	when Samuel was old,
c27985	that he made his sons judges over Israel.
c27986	Now the name of his firstborn was Joel;
c27987	and the name of his second, Abiah:
c27988	<i>they were</i> judges in Beersheba.
c27989	And his sons walked not in his ways,
c27990	but turned aside after lucre,
c27991	and took bribes,
c27992	and perverted judgment.
c27993	Then all the elders of Israel gathered themselves together,
c27994	and came to Samuel unto Ramah,
c27995	And said unto
c27996	him, Behold, thou art old,
c27997	and thy sons walk not in thy ways:
c27998	now make us a king
c27999	to judge us like all the nations.
c28000	But the thing displeased Samuel,
c28001	when they said,
c28002	Give us a king
c28003	to judge
c28004	us. And Samuel prayed unto the LORD.
c28005	And the LORD said unto Samuel,
c28006	Hearken unto the voice of the people in all
c28007	that they say unto
c28008	thee: for they have not rejected
c28009	thee, but they have rejected
c28010	me, that I should not reign over them.
c28011	According to all the works
c28012	which they have done since the day
c28013	that I brought them up out of Egypt
c28014	even unto this day,
c28015	wherewith they have forsaken
c28016	me, and served other gods,
c28017	so do they also unto thee.
c28018	Now
c28019	therefore hearken unto their voice:
c28020	howbeit yet protest solemnly
c28021	unto them, and shew them the manner of the king
c28022	that shall reign over them.
c28023	And Samuel told all the words of the LORD unto the people
c28024	that asked of him a king.
c28025	And he said,
c28026	This will be the manner of the king
c28027	that shall reign over
c28028	you: He will take your sons,
c28029	and appoint <i>them</i> for himself, for his chariots, and <i>to be</i> his horsemen;
c28030	and <i>some</i> shall run before his chariots.
c28031	And he will appoint him captains over thousands, and captains over fifties;
c28032	and <i>will set them</i> to ear his ground,
c28033	and to reap his harvest,
c28034	and to make his instruments of war, and instruments of his chariots.
c28035	And he will take your daughters <i>to be</i> confectionaries, and <i>to be</i> cooks, and <i>to be</i> bakers.
c28036	And he will take your fields, and your vineyards, and your oliveyards, <i>even</i> the best
c28037	<i>of them,</i> and give <i>them</i> to his servants.
c28038	And he will take the tenth of your seed, and of your vineyards,
c28039	and give to his officers, and to his servants.
c28040	And he will take your menservants, and your maidservants, and your goodliest young men, and your asses,
c28041	and put <i>them</i> to his work.
c28042	He will take the tenth of your sheep:
c28043	and ye shall be his servants.
c28044	And ye shall cry out in that day because of your king
c28045	which ye shall have chosen
c28046	you; and the LORD will not hear you in that day.
c28047	Nevertheless the people refused
c28048	to obey the voice of Samuel;
c28049	and they said,
c28050	Nay;
c28051	but we will have a king over us;
c28052	That we also may be like all the nations;
c28053	and that our king may judge
c28054	us, and go out before
c28055	us, and fight our battles.
c28056	And Samuel heard all the words of the people,
c28057	and he rehearsed them in the ears of the LORD.
c28058	And the LORD said to Samuel,
c28059	Hearken unto their voice,
c28060	and make them a king.
c28061	And Samuel said unto the men of Israel,
c28062	Go
c28063	ye every man unto his city.
c28064	Now there was a man of Benjamin,
c28065	whose name <i>was</i> Kish, the son of Abiel, the son of Zeror, the son of Bechorath, the son of Aphiah,
c28066	a Benjamite,
c28067	a mighty man of power.
c28068	And he had a son,
c28069	whose name <i>was</i> Saul,
c28070	a choice young man, and a goodly:
c28071	and <i>there was</i> not among the children of Israel a goodlier person than
c28072	he: from his shoulders and upward <i>he was</i> higher than any of the people.
c28073	And the asses of Kish Saul's father were lost.
c28074	And Kish said to Saul his son,
c28075	Take now one of the servants with
c28076	thee, and arise,
c28077	go
c28078	seek the asses.
c28079	And he passed through mount Ephraim,
c28080	and passed through the land of Shalisha,
c28081	but they found <i>them</i> not:
c28082	then they passed through the land of Shalim,
c28083	and <i>there they were</i> not:
c28084	and he passed through the land of the Benjamites,
c28085	but they found <i>them</i> not.
c28086	<i>And</i> when they were come to the land of Zuph,
c28087	Saul said to his servant
c28088	that <i>was</i> with
c28089	him, Come,
c28090	and let us return;
c28091	lest my father leave <i>caring</i> for the asses,
c28092	and take thought for us.
c28093	And he said
c28094	unto him, Behold now, <i>there is</i> in this city a man of God,
c28095	and <i>he is</i> an honourable man;
c28096	all
c28097	that he saith
c28098	cometh surely to pass:
c28099	now let us go thither;
c28100	peradventure he can shew us our way
c28101	that we should go.
c28102	Then said Saul to his servant,
c28103	But, behold, <i>if</i> we go,
c28104	what shall we bring the man?
c28105	for the bread is spent in our vessels,
c28106	and <i>there is</i> not a present
c28107	to bring to the man of God:
c28108	what have we?
c28109	And the servant answered Saul again,
c28111	and said,
c28112	Behold, I have here at hand the fourth part of a shekel of silver:
c28113	<i>that</i> will I give to the man of God,
c28114	to tell us our way.
c28115	(Beforetime in Israel, when a man went
c28117	to enquire of God, thus he spake,
c28118	Come,
c28119	and let us go to the seer:
c28120	for <i>he that is</i> now <i>called</i> a Prophet was beforetime called a Seer.)
c28121	Then said Saul to his servant,
c28122	Well said;
c28123	come,
c28124	let us go.
c28125	So they went unto the city
c28126	where the man of God <i>was.</i>
c28127	<i>And</i> as they went up the hill to the city,
c28128	they found young maidens
c28129	going out
c28130	to draw water,
c28131	and said
c28132	unto them, Is the seer here?
c28133	And they answered
c28134	them, and said,
c28135	He is;
c28136	behold, <i>he is</i> before
c28137	you: make haste now,
c28138	for he came to day to the city;
c28139	for <i>there is</i> a sacrifice of the people to day in the high place:
c28140	As soon as ye be come into the city,
c28141	ye shall straightway find
c28142	him, before he go up to the high place
c28143	to eat:
c28144	for the people will not eat
c28145	until he come,
c28146	because he doth bless the sacrifice;
c28147	<i>and</i> afterwards they eat that be bidden.
c28148	Now
c28149	therefore get you up;
c28150	for
c28151	about this time ye shall find him.
c28152	And they went up into the city:
c28153	<i>and</i> when they were come into the city,
c28154	behold,
c28155	Samuel came out
c28156	against
c28157	them, for to go up to the high place.
c28158	Now the LORD had told Samuel in his ear a day
c28159	before Saul came,
c28160	saying,
c28161	To morrow about this time I will send thee a man out of the land of Benjamin, and thou shalt anoint him <i>to be</i> captain over my people Israel,
c28163	that he may save my people out of the hand of the Philistines:
c28164	for I have looked upon my people,
c28165	because their cry is come unto me.
c28166	And when Samuel saw Saul,
c28167	the LORD said
c28168	unto him, Behold the man
c28169	whom I spake to
c28170	thee of! this same shall reign over my people.
c28171	Then Saul drew near to Samuel in the gate,
c28172	and said,
c28173	Tell me, I pray thee,
c28174	where the seer's house <i>is.</i>
c28175	And Samuel answered Saul,
c28176	and said,
c28177	I <i>am</i> the seer:
c28178	go up before me unto the high place;
c28179	for ye shall eat with me to day,
c28180	and to morrow I will let thee go,
c28181	thee all
c28182	that <i>is</i> in thine heart.
c28183	and will tell
c28184	And as for thine asses
c28185	that were lost three days ago,
c28186	set not thy mind
c28187	on them; for they are found.
c28188	And on whom <i>is</i> all the desire of Israel?
c28189	<i>Is it</i> not on thee, and on all thy father's house?
c28190	And Saul answered
c28191	and said,
c28192	<i>Am</i> not I a Benjamite, of the smallest of the tribes of Israel?
c28193	and my family the least of all the families of the tribe of Benjamin?
c28194	wherefore then speakest thou so to me?
c28195	And Samuel took Saul and his servant,
c28196	and brought them into the parlour,
c28197	and made them sit in the chiefest place among them that were bidden,
c28198	which <i>were</i> about thirty persons.
c28199	And Samuel said unto the cook,
c28200	Bring the portion
c28201	which I gave
c28202	thee, of which I said unto
c28203	thee, Set it by thee.
c28204	And the cook took up the shoulder,
c28205	and <i>that</i> which <i>was</i> upon
c28206	it, and set <i>it</i> before Saul.
c28207	And <i>Samuel</i> said,
c28208	Behold
c28209	that which is left!
c28210	set <i>it</i> before
c28211	thee, <i>and</i> eat:
c28212	for unto this time hath it been kept
c28213	for thee since I said,
c28214	I have invited the people.
c28215	So Saul did eat with Samuel that day.
c28216	And when they were come down from the high place into the city,
c28217	<i>Samuel</i> communed with Saul upon the top of the house.
c28218	And they arose early:
c28219	and it came to pass
c28220	about the spring of the day,
c28221	that Samuel called Saul to the top of the house,
c28222	saying,
c28223	Up,
c28224	that I may send thee away.
c28225	And Saul arose,
c28226	and they went out both of them, he and Samuel, abroad.
c28227	<i>And</i> as they were going down to the end of the city,
c28228	Samuel said to Saul,
c28229	Bid the servant
c28230	pass on before
c28231	us, (and he passed on,)
c28232	but stand thou still a while,
c28233	that I may shew thee the word of God.
c28234	Then Samuel took a vial of oil,
c28235	and poured <i>it</i> upon his head,
c28236	and kissed
c28237	him, and said,
c28238	<i>Is it</i> not
c28239	because the LORD hath anointed thee <i>to be</i> captain over his inheritance?
c28240	When thou art departed from me to day, then thou shalt find two men by
c28241	Rachel's sepulchre in the border of Benjamin at Zelzah;
c28242	and they will say unto
c28243	thee, The asses which thou wentest
c28245	to seek are found:
c28246	and, lo, thy father hath left the care of the asses,
c28247	and sorroweth
c28248	for you, saying,
c28249	What shall I do for my son?
c28250	Then shalt thou go on forward from thence,
c28251	and thou shalt come to the plain of Tabor,
c28252	and there shall meet thee three men
c28253	going up to God to Bethel,
c28254	one carrying three kids,
c28255	and another carrying three loaves of bread,
c28256	and another carrying a bottle of wine:
c28257	And they will salute
c28258	thee, and give thee two <i>loaves</i> of bread;
c28259	which thou shalt receive of their hands.
c28260	After that thou shalt come to the hill of God,
c28261	where <i>is</i> the garrison of the Philistines:
c28262	and it shall come to pass,
c28263	when thou art come thither to the city,
c28264	that thou shalt meet a company of prophets
c28265	coming down from the high place
c28266	with a psaltery, and a tabret, and a pipe, and a harp, before
c28267	them; and they shall prophesy:
c28268	And the Spirit of the LORD will come upon
c28269	thee, and thou shalt prophesy with them,
c28270	and shalt be turned into another man.
c28271	And let it be,
c28272	when these signs are come
c28273	unto thee, <i>that</i> thou do
c28274	as occasion serve
c28275	thee; for God <i>is</i> with thee.
c28276	And thou shalt go down before me to Gilgal;
c28277	and, behold,
c28278	I will come down unto
c28279	thee, to offer burnt offerings,
c28280	<i>and</i> to sacrifice sacrifices of peace offerings:
c28281	seven days shalt thou tarry,
c28282	till I come to
c28283	thee, and shew
c28284	thee what thou shalt do.
c28285	And it was
c28286	<i>so,</i> that when he had turned his back
c28287	to go from Samuel,
c28288	God gave him another heart:
c28289	and all those signs came to pass that day.
c28290	And when they came thither to the hill,
c28291	behold, a company of prophets
c28292	met
c28293	him; and the Spirit of God came upon
c28294	him, and he prophesied among them.
c28295	And it came to pass, when all that knew him beforetime
c28296	saw
c28297	that, behold,
c28298	he prophesied among the prophets,
c28299	then the people said
c28300	one to another,
c28301	What <i>is</i> this <i>that</i> is come unto the son of Kish?
c28302	<i>Is</i> Saul also among the prophets?
c28303	And one of the same place answered
c28304	and said,
c28305	But who <i>is</i> their father?
c28306	Therefore it became a proverb,
c28307	<i>Is</i> Saul also among the prophets?
c28308	And when he had made an end
c28309	of prophesying,
c28310	he came to the high place.
c28311	And Saul's uncle said unto him and to his servant,
c28312	Whither went
c28313	ye? And he said,
c28314	To seek the asses:
c28315	and when we saw
c28316	that <i>they were</i> no where,
c28317	we came to Samuel.
c28318	And Saul's uncle said,
c28319	Tell me, I pray thee,
c28320	what Samuel said unto you.
c28321	And Saul said unto his uncle,
c28322	He told us plainly
c28323	that the asses were found.
c28324	But of the matter of the kingdom, whereof Samuel spake, he told him not.
c28326	And Samuel called the people together unto the LORD to Mizpeh;
c28327	And said unto the children of Israel,
c28328	Thus saith the LORD God of Israel,
c28329	I brought up Israel out of Egypt,
c28330	and delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of all kingdoms,
c28331	<i>and</i> of them that oppressed you:
c28332	And ye have this day rejected your God,
c28333	who himself saved you out of all your adversities and your tribulations;
c28334	and ye have said
c28335	unto him, <i>Nay,</i> but set a king over
c28336	us. Now
c28337	therefore present yourselves before the LORD by your tribes, and by your thousands.
c28338	And when Samuel had caused all the tribes of Israel to come near,
c28339	the tribe of Benjamin was taken.
c28340	When he had caused the tribe of Benjamin to come near by their families,
c28341	the family of Matri was taken,
c28342	and Saul the son of Kish was taken:
c28343	and when they sought
c28344	him, he could not be found.
c28345	Therefore they enquired of the LORD further,
c28346	if the man should yet come thither.
c28347	And the LORD answered,
c28348	Behold, he hath hid himself among the stuff.
c28349	And they ran
c28350	and fetched him thence:
c28351	and when he stood among the people,
c28352	he was higher than any of the people from his shoulders and upward.
c28353	And Samuel said to all the people,
c28354	See
c28355	ye him whom the LORD hath chosen,
c28356	that <i>there is</i> none like him among all the people?
c28357	And all the people shouted,
c28358	and said,
c28359	God save the king.
c28360	Then Samuel told the people the manner of the kingdom,
c28361	and wrote <i>it</i> in a book,
c28362	and laid <i>it</i> up before the LORD.
c28363	And Samuel sent all the people away, every man to his house.
c28364	And Saul also went home to Gibeah;
c28365	and there went with him a band of men,
c28366	whose hearts God had touched.
c28367	But the children of Belial said,
c28368	How shall this man save
c28369	us? And they despised
c28370	him, and brought him no presents.
c28371	But he held his peace.
c28372	Then Nahash the Ammonite came up,
c28373	and encamped against Jabeshgilead:
c28374	and all the men of Jabesh said unto Nahash,
c28375	Make a covenant
c28376	with us, and we will serve thee.
c28377	And Nahash the Ammonite answered
c28378	them, On this <i>condition</i> will I make
c28379	<i>a covenant</i> with you, that I may thrust out all your right eyes,
c28380	and lay it <i>for</i> a reproach upon all Israel.
c28381	And the elders of Jabesh said unto
c28382	him, Give us seven days' respite,
c28383	that we may send messengers unto all the coasts of Israel:
c28384	and then, if <i>there be</i> no man
c28385	to save
c28386	us, we will come out to thee.
c28387	Then came the messengers to Gibeah of Saul,
c28388	and told the tidings in the ears of the people:
c28389	and all the people lifted up their voices,
c28390	and wept.
c28391	And, behold,
c28392	Saul came after the herd out of the field;
c28393	and Saul said,
c28394	What <i>aileth</i> the people
c28395	that they weep?
c28396	And they told him the tidings of the men of Jabesh.
c28397	And the Spirit of God came upon Saul
c28398	when he heard those tidings,
c28399	and his anger was kindled greatly.
c28400	And he took a yoke of oxen,
c28401	and hewed them in pieces,
c28402	and sent <i>them</i> throughout all the coasts of Israel by the hands of messengers,
c28403	saying,
c28404	Whosoever cometh not forth after Saul and after Samuel,
c28405	so shall it be done unto his oxen.
c28406	And the fear of the LORD fell on the people,
c28407	and they came out with one consent.
c28408	And when he numbered them in Bezek,
c28409	the children of Israel were three hundred thousand,
c28410	and the men of Judah thirty thousand.
c28411	And they said unto the messengers
c28412	that came,
c28413	Thus shall ye say unto the men of Jabeshgilead,
c28414	To morrow, by <i>that time</i> the sun be hot, ye shall have help.
c28416	And the messengers came
c28417	and shewed <i>it</i> to the men of Jabesh;
c28418	and they were glad.
c28419	Therefore the men of Jabesh said,
c28420	To morrow we will come out unto
c28421	you, and ye shall do with us all
c28422	that seemeth good unto you.
c28423	And it was <i>so</i> on the morrow,
c28424	that Saul put the people in three companies;
c28425	and they came into the midst of the host in the morning watch,
c28426	and slew the Ammonites
c28427	until the heat of the day:
c28428	and it came to pass,
c28429	that they which remained
c28430	were scattered,
c28431	so that two of them were not left together.
c28432	And the people said unto Samuel,
c28433	Who
c28434	<i>is</i> he that said,
c28435	Shall Saul reign over
c28436	us? bring the men,
c28437	that we may put them to death.
c28438	And Saul said,
c28439	There shall not a man be put to death this day:
c28440	for to day the LORD hath wrought salvation in Israel.
c28441	Then said Samuel to the people,
c28442	Come,
c28443	and let us go to Gilgal,
c28444	and renew the kingdom there.
c28445	And all the people went to Gilgal;
c28446	and there they made Saul king before the LORD in Gilgal;
c28447	and there they sacrificed sacrifices of peace offerings before the LORD;
c28448	and there Saul and all the men of Israel rejoiced greatly.
c28449	And Samuel said unto all Israel,
c28450	Behold, I have hearkened unto your voice in all
c28451	that ye said
c28452	unto me, and have made a king over you.
c28453	And now,
c28454	behold, the king walketh before
c28455	you: and I am old
c28456	and grayheaded;
c28458	and, behold, my sons <i>are</i> with
c28459	you: and I have walked before you from my childhood unto this day.
c28460	Behold,
c28461	here I <i>am:</i> witness against me before the LORD, and before his anointed:
c28462	whose ox have I taken?
c28463	or whose ass have I taken?
c28464	or whom have I defrauded?
c28465	whom have I oppressed?
c28466	or of whose hand have I received <i>any</i> bribe
c28467	to blind mine eyes
c28468	therewith? and I will restore it you.
c28469	And they said,
c28470	Thou hast not defrauded
c28471	us, nor oppressed
c28472	us, neither hast thou taken ought of any man's hand.
c28473	And he said unto
c28474	them, The LORD <i>is</i> witness
c28475	against you, and his anointed <i>is</i> witness this day,
c28476	that ye have not found ought in my hand.
c28477	And they answered,
c28478	<i>He is</i> witness.
c28479	And Samuel said unto the people,
c28480	<i>It is</i> the LORD
c28481	that advanced Moses and Aaron,
c28482	and that brought your fathers up out of the land of Egypt.
c28483	Now
c28484	therefore stand still,
c28485	that I may reason with you before the LORD of all the righteous acts of the LORD,
c28486	which he did to you and to your fathers.
c28487	When Jacob was come into Egypt,
c28488	and your fathers cried unto the LORD,
c28489	then the LORD sent Moses and Aaron,
c28490	which brought forth your fathers out of Egypt,
c28491	and made them dwell in this place.
c28492	And when they forgat the LORD their God,
c28493	he sold them into the hand of Sisera, captain of the host of Hazor, and into the hand of the Philistines, and into the hand of the king of Moab,
c28494	and they fought against them.
c28495	And they cried unto the LORD,
c28496	and said,
c28497	We have sinned,
c28498	because we have forsaken the LORD,
c28499	and have served Baalim and Ashtaroth:
c28500	but now
c28501	deliver us out of the hand of our enemies,
c28502	and we will serve thee.
c28503	And the LORD sent Jerubbaal, and Bedan, and Jephthah, and Samuel,
c28504	and delivered you out of the hand of your enemies on every side,
c28505	and ye dwelled safe.
c28506	And when ye saw
c28507	that Nahash the king of the children of Ammon came against
c28508	you, ye said
c28509	unto me, Nay;
c28510	but a king shall reign over
c28511	us: when the LORD your God <i>was</i> your king.
c28512	Now
c28513	therefore behold the king
c28514	whom ye have chosen,
c28515	<i>and</i> whom ye have desired!
c28516	and, behold,
c28517	the LORD hath set a king over you.
c28518	If ye will fear the LORD,
c28519	and serve
c28520	him, and obey his voice,
c28521	and not rebel against the commandment of the LORD,
c28522	then shall both ye and also the king that reigneth over you continue
c28524	following the LORD your God:
c28525	But if ye will not obey the voice of the LORD,
c28526	but rebel against the commandment of the LORD,
c28527	then shall the hand of the LORD be against you, as <i>it was</i> against your fathers.
c28528	Now therefore
c28529	stand
c28530	and see this great thing,
c28531	which the LORD will do before your eyes.
c28532	<i>Is it</i> not wheat harvest to day?
c28533	I will call unto the LORD,
c28534	and he shall send thunder and rain;
c28535	that ye may perceive
c28536	and see
c28537	that your wickedness <i>is</i> great,
c28538	which ye have done in the sight of the LORD,
c28539	in asking you a king.
c28540	So Samuel called unto the LORD;
c28541	and the LORD sent thunder and rain that day:
c28542	and all the people greatly feared the LORD and Samuel.
c28543	And all the people said unto Samuel,
c28544	Pray for thy servants unto the LORD thy God,
c28545	that we die not:
c28546	for we have added unto all our sins <i>this</i> evil,
c28547	to ask us a king.
c28548	And Samuel said unto the people,
c28549	Fear not:
c28550	ye have done all this wickedness:
c28551	yet turn not aside from following the LORD,
c28552	but serve the LORD with all your heart;
c28553	And turn ye not aside:
c28554	for <i>then should ye go</i> after vain
c28555	<i>things,</i> which cannot profit
c28556	nor deliver;
c28557	for they <i>are</i> vain.
c28558	For the LORD will not forsake his people for his great name's sake:
c28559	because it hath pleased the LORD
c28560	to make you his people.
c28561	Moreover as for me,
c28562	God forbid
c28563	that I should sin against the LORD
c28564	in ceasing
c28565	to pray for
c28566	you: but I will teach you the good and the right way:
c28567	Only fear the LORD,
c28568	and serve him in truth with all your heart:
c28569	for consider
c28570	how great <i>things</i> he hath done for you.
c28571	But if ye shall still do wickedly,
c28572	ye shall be consumed, both ye and your king.
c28573	Saul reigned one year;
c28575	and when he had reigned two years over Israel,
c28576	Saul chose him three thousand <i>men</i> of Israel;
c28577	<i>whereof</i> two thousand were with Saul in Michmash and in mount Bethel,
c28578	and a thousand were with Jonathan in Gibeah of Benjamin:
c28579	and the rest of the people he sent every man to his tent.
c28580	And Jonathan smote the garrison of the Philistines
c28581	that <i>was</i> in Geba,
c28582	and the Philistines heard
c28583	<i>of it.</i> And Saul blew the trumpet throughout all the land,
c28584	saying,
c28585	Let the Hebrews hear.
c28586	And all Israel heard
c28587	say
c28588	<i>that</i> Saul had smitten a garrison of the Philistines,
c28589	and <i>that</i> Israel also was had in abomination with the Philistines.
c28590	And the people were called together after Saul to Gilgal.
c28591	And the Philistines gathered themselves together
c28592	to fight with Israel,
c28593	thirty thousand chariots, and six thousand horsemen, and people as the sand
c28594	which <i>is</i> on the sea shore
c28595	in multitude:
c28596	and they came up,
c28597	and pitched in Michmash, eastward from Bethaven.
c28598	When the men of Israel saw
c28599	that they were in a strait,
c28600	(for the people were distressed,)
c28601	then the people did hide themselves in caves, and in thickets, and in rocks, and in high places, and in pits.
c28602	And <i>some of</i> the Hebrews went over Jordan to the land of Gad and Gilead.
c28603	As for Saul,
c28604	he <i>was</i> yet in Gilgal,
c28605	and all the people followed him trembling.
c28606	And he tarried seven days, according to the set time
c28607	that Samuel
c28608	<i>had appointed:</i> but Samuel came not to Gilgal;
c28609	and the people were scattered from him.
c28610	And Saul said,
c28611	Bring hither a burnt offering to me, and peace offerings.
c28612	And he offered the burnt offering.
c28613	And it came to pass,
c28614	that as soon as he had made an end
c28615	of offering the burnt offering,
c28616	behold,
c28617	Samuel came;
c28618	and Saul went out
c28619	to meet
c28620	him, that he might salute him.
c28621	And Samuel said,
c28622	What hast thou done?
c28623	And Saul said,
c28624	Because I saw
c28625	that the people were scattered from
c28626	me, and <i>that</i> thou camest not within the days appointed,
c28627	and <i>that</i> the Philistines gathered themselves together at Michmash;
c28628	Therefore said
c28629	I, The Philistines will come down now upon me to Gilgal,
c28630	and I have not made supplication unto the LORD:
c28631	I forced myself
c28632	therefore, and offered a burnt offering.
c28633	And Samuel said to Saul,
c28634	Thou hast done foolishly:
c28635	thou hast not kept the commandment of the LORD thy God,
c28636	which he commanded
c28637	thee: for now would the LORD have established thy kingdom upon Israel for ever.
c28638	But now thy kingdom shall not continue:
c28639	the LORD hath sought him a man after his own heart,
c28640	and the LORD hath commanded him <i>to be</i> captain over his people,
c28641	because thou hast not kept
c28642	<i>that</i> which the LORD commanded thee.
c28643	And Samuel arose,
c28644	and gat him up from Gilgal unto Gibeah of Benjamin.
c28645	And Saul numbered the people
c28646	<i>that were</i> present with
c28647	him, about six hundred men.
c28648	And Saul, and Jonathan his son, and the people
c28649	<i>that were</i> present with
c28650	them, abode in Gibeah of Benjamin:
c28651	but the Philistines encamped in Michmash.
c28652	And the spoilers came out of the camp of the Philistines in three companies:
c28653	one company turned unto the way <i>that leadeth to</i> Ophrah, unto the land of Shual:
c28654	And another company turned the way <i>to</i> Bethhoron:
c28655	and another company turned <i>to</i> the way of the border
c28656	that looketh to the valley of Zeboim toward the wilderness.
c28657	Now there was no smith found throughout all the land of Israel:
c28658	for the Philistines said,
c28659	Lest the Hebrews make <i>them</i> swords or spears:
c28660	But all the Israelites went down to the Philistines,
c28661	to sharpen
c28662	every man his share, and his coulter, and his axe, and his mattock.
c28663	Yet they had a file for the mattocks, and for the coulters, and for the forks, and for the axes,
c28664	and to sharpen the goads.
c28665	So it came to pass in the day of battle,
c28666	that there was neither sword nor spear found in the hand of any of the people
c28667	that <i>were</i> with Saul and Jonathan:
c28668	but with Saul and with Jonathan his son was there found.
c28669	And the garrison of the Philistines went out to the passage of Michmash.
c28670	Now it came to pass upon a day,
c28671	that Jonathan the son of Saul said unto the young man that bare his armour,
c28672	Come,
c28673	and let us go over to the Philistines' garrison,
c28674	that <i>is</i> on the other side.
c28675	But he told not his father.
c28676	And Saul tarried in the uttermost part of Gibeah under a pomegranate tree
c28677	which <i>is</i> in Migron:
c28678	and the people
c28679	that <i>were</i> with
c28680	him <i>were</i> about six hundred men;
c28681	And Ahiah, the son of Ahitub, Ichabod's brother, the son of Phinehas, the son of Eli, the LORD'S priest in Shiloh, wearing an ephod.
c28682	And the people knew not
c28683	that Jonathan was gone.
c28684	And between the passages,
c28685	by which Jonathan sought
c28686	to go over unto the Philistines' garrison,
c28687	<i>there was</i> a sharp rock on the one side,
c28688	and a sharp rock on the other side:
c28689	and the name of the one <i>was</i> Bozez,
c28690	and the name of the other Seneh.
c28691	The forefront of the one <i>was</i> situate northward over against Michmash,
c28692	and the other southward over against Gibeah.
c28693	And Jonathan said to the young man that bare his armour,
c28694	Come,
c28695	and let us go over unto the garrison of these uncircumcised:
c28696	it may be that the LORD will work
c28697	for us: for <i>there is</i> no restraint to the LORD
c28698	to save by many or by few.
c28699	And his armourbearer said
c28700	unto him, Do all
c28701	that <i>is</i> in thine heart:
c28702	turn
c28703	thee; behold, I <i>am</i> with thee according to thy heart.
c28704	Then said Jonathan,
c28705	Behold, we will pass over unto <i>these</i> men,
c28706	and we will discover ourselves unto them.
c28707	If they say thus unto
c28708	us, Tarry
c28709	until we come to
c28710	you; then we will stand still in our place,
c28711	and will not go up unto them.
c28712	But if they say thus,
c28713	Come up unto
c28714	us; then we will go up:
c28715	for the LORD hath delivered them into our hand:
c28716	and this <i>shall be</i> a sign unto us.
c28717	And both of them discovered themselves unto the garrison of the Philistines:
c28718	and the Philistines said,
c28719	Behold, the Hebrews come forth out of the holes
c28720	where they had hid themselves.
c28721	And the men of the garrison answered Jonathan and his armourbearer,
c28722	and said,
c28723	Come up to
c28724	us, and we will shew you a thing.
c28725	And Jonathan said unto his armourbearer,
c28726	Come up after
c28727	me: for the LORD hath delivered them into the hand of Israel.
c28728	And Jonathan climbed up upon his hands and upon his feet,
c28729	and his armourbearer after
c28730	him: and they fell before Jonathan;
c28731	and his armourbearer slew after him.
c28732	And that first slaughter, which Jonathan and his armourbearer made, was
c28734	about twenty men, within as it were an half acre of land, <i>which</i> a yoke <i>of oxen might plow.</i>
c28735	And there was trembling in the host, in the field, and among all the people:
c28736	the garrison, and the spoilers, they also trembled,
c28737	and the earth quaked:
c28738	so it was a very great trembling.
c28739	And the watchmen of Saul in Gibeah of Benjamin looked;
c28740	and, behold,
c28741	the multitude melted away,
c28742	and they went
c28743	on beating down <i>one another.</i>
c28744	Then said Saul unto the people
c28745	that <i>were</i> with
c28746	him, Number now,
c28747	and see
c28748	who is gone from
c28749	us. And when they had numbered,
c28750	behold,
c28751	Jonathan and his armourbearer <i>were</i> not <i>there.</i>
c28752	And Saul said unto Ahiah,
c28753	Bring hither the ark of God.
c28754	For the ark of God was at that time
c28755	with the children of Israel.
c28756	And it came to pass,
c28757	while Saul talked unto the priest,
c28758	that the noise
c28759	that <i>was</i> in the host of the Philistines
c28760	went on and increased:
c28761	and Saul said unto the priest,
c28762	Withdraw thine hand.
c28763	And Saul and all the people that <i>were</i> with him assembled themselves,
c28765	and they came to the battle:
c28766	and, behold,
c28767	every man's sword was against his fellow,
c28768	<i>and there was</i> a very great discomfiture.
c28769	Moreover the Hebrews <i>that</i> were with the Philistines before that time,
c28770	which went up with them into the camp <i>from the country</i> round about,
c28771	even they also
c28772	<i>turned</i> to be with the Israelites
c28773	that <i>were</i> with Saul and Jonathan.
c28774	Likewise all the men of Israel
c28775	which had hid themselves in mount Ephraim,
c28776	<i>when</i> they heard
c28777	that the Philistines fled,
c28778	even they also followed hard after them in the battle.
c28779	So the LORD saved Israel that day:
c28780	and the battle passed over unto Bethaven.
c28781	And the men of Israel were distressed that day:
c28782	for Saul had adjured the people,
c28783	saying,
c28784	Cursed <i>be</i> the man
c28785	that eateth <i>any</i> food until evening,
c28786	that I may be avenged on mine enemies.
c28787	So none of the people tasted <i>any</i> food.
c28788	And all <i>they of</i> the land came to a wood;
c28789	and there was honey upon the ground.
c28790	And when the people were come into the wood,
c28791	behold, the honey dropped;
c28792	but no man put his hand to his mouth:
c28793	for the people feared the oath.
c28794	But Jonathan heard not
c28795	when his father charged the people with the oath:
c28796	wherefore he put forth the end of the rod
c28797	that <i>was</i> in his hand,
c28798	and dipped it in an honeycomb,
c28799	and put his hand to his mouth;
c28800	and his eyes were enlightened.
c28801	Then answered one of the people,
c28802	and said,
c28803	Thy father straitly charged the people with an oath,
c28804	saying,
c28805	Cursed <i>be</i> the man
c28806	that eateth <i>any</i> food this day.
c28807	And the people were faint.
c28808	Then said Jonathan,
c28809	My father hath troubled the land:
c28810	see, I pray you,
c28811	how mine eyes have been enlightened,
c28812	because I tasted a little of this honey.
c28813	How much more,
c28814	if haply the people had eaten freely to day of the spoil of their enemies
c28815	which they found?
c28816	for had there not been now a much greater slaughter among the Philistines?
c28817	And they smote the Philistines that day from Michmash to Aijalon:
c28818	and the people were very faint.
c28819	And the people flew upon the spoil,
c28820	and took sheep, and oxen, and calves,
c28821	and slew <i>them</i> on the ground:
c28822	and the people did eat <i>them</i> with the blood.
c28823	Then they told Saul,
c28824	saying,
c28825	Behold, the people sin against the LORD,
c28826	in that they eat with the blood.
c28827	And he said,
c28828	Ye have transgressed:
c28829	roll a great stone unto me this day.
c28830	And Saul said,
c28831	Disperse yourselves among the people,
c28832	and say
c28833	unto them, Bring me hither
c28834	every man his ox,
c28835	and every man his sheep,
c28836	and slay <i>them</i> here,
c28837	and eat;
c28838	and sin not against the LORD
c28839	in eating with the blood.
c28840	And all the people brought every man his ox with him that night,
c28841	and slew <i>them</i> there.
c28842	And Saul built an altar unto the LORD:
c28843	the same was the first
c28844	altar that he built unto the LORD.
c28845	And Saul said,
c28846	Let us go down after the Philistines by night,
c28847	and spoil
c28848	them until the morning light,
c28849	and let us not leave a man
c28850	of them. And they said,
c28851	whatsoever
c28852	seemeth good
c28853	Do
c28854	unto thee. Then said the priest,
c28855	Let us draw near hither unto God.
c28856	And Saul asked counsel of God,
c28857	Shall I go down after the Philistines?
c28858	wilt thou deliver them into the hand of Israel?
c28859	But he answered him not that day.
c28860	And Saul said,
c28861	Draw ye near hither,
c28862	all the chief of the people:
c28863	and know
c28864	and see
c28865	wherein this sin hath been this day.
c28866	For, <i>as</i> the LORD liveth,
c28867	which saveth Israel,
c28868	though it be in Jonathan my son,
c28869	he shall surely die.
c28870	But <i>there was</i> not a man among all the people <i>that</i> answered him.
c28871	Then said he unto all Israel,
c28872	Be ye on one side,
c28873	and I and Jonathan my son will be on the other side.
c28874	And the people said unto Saul,
c28875	what seemeth good unto thee.
c28876	Do
c28877	Therefore Saul said unto the LORD God of Israel,
c28878	Give a perfect
c28879	<i>lot.</i> And Saul and Jonathan were taken:
c28880	but the people escaped.
c28881	And Saul said,
c28882	Cast <i>lots</i> between me and Jonathan my son.
c28883	And Jonathan was taken.
c28884	Then Saul said to Jonathan,
c28885	Tell
c28886	me what thou hast done.
c28887	And Jonathan told
c28888	him, and said,
c28889	I did but taste a little honey with the end of the rod
c28890	that <i>was</i> in mine hand,
c28892	<i>and,</i> lo, I must die.
c28893	And Saul answered,
c28894	God do so
c28895	and more also:
c28896	for thou shalt surely die,
c28897	Jonathan.
c28898	And the people said unto Saul,
c28899	Shall Jonathan die,
c28900	who hath wrought this great salvation in Israel?
c28901	God forbid:
c28902	<i>as</i> the LORD liveth,
c28903	there shall not one hair of his head fall to the ground;
c28904	for he hath wrought with God this day.
c28905	So the people rescued Jonathan,
c28906	that he died not.
c28907	Then Saul went up from following the Philistines:
c28908	and the Philistines went to their own place.
c28909	So Saul took the kingdom over Israel,
c28910	and fought against all his enemies on every side, against Moab, and against the children of Ammon, and against Edom, and against the kings of Zobah, and against the Philistines:
c28911	and whithersoever
c28912	he turned
c28913	himself, he vexed <i>them.</i>
c28914	And he gathered an host,
c28915	and smote the Amalekites,
c28916	and delivered Israel out of the hands of them that spoiled them.
c28917	Now the sons of Saul were Jonathan, and Ishui, and Melchishua:
c28918	and the names of his two daughters
c28919	<i>were these;</i> the name of the firstborn Merab,
c28920	and the name of the younger Michal:
c28921	And the name of Saul's wife <i>was</i> Ahinoam, the daughter of Ahimaaz:
c28922	and the name of the captain of his host <i>was</i> Abner, the son of Ner, Saul's uncle.
c28923	And Kish <i>was</i> the father of Saul;
c28924	and Ner the father of Abner <i>was</i> the son of Abiel.
c28925	And there was sore war against the Philistines all the days of Saul:
c28926	and when Saul saw any strong man, or any valiant man,
c28927	he took him unto him.
c28928	Samuel also said unto Saul,
c28929	The LORD sent
c28930	me to anoint thee <i>to be</i> king over his people, over Israel:
c28931	now
c28932	therefore hearken thou unto the voice of the words of the LORD.
c28933	Thus saith the LORD of hosts,
c28934	I remember
c28935	<i>that</i> which Amalek did to Israel,
c28936	how he laid <i>wait</i> for him in the way,
c28937	when he came up from Egypt.
c28938	Now
c28939	go
c28940	and smite Amalek,
c28941	and utterly destroy all
c28942	that
c28943	they have, and spare them not;
c28944	but slay both man and woman, infant and suckling, ox and sheep, camel and ass.
c28945	And Saul gathered the people together,
c28946	and numbered them in Telaim,
c28947	two hundred thousand footmen, and ten thousand men of Judah.
c28948	And Saul came to a city of Amalek,
c28949	and laid wait in the valley.
c28950	And Saul said unto the Kenites,
c28951	Go,
c28952	depart,
c28953	get you down from among the Amalekites,
c28954	lest I destroy you with
c28955	them: for ye shewed kindness to all the children of Israel,
c28956	when they came up out of Egypt.
c28957	So the Kenites departed from among the Amalekites.
c28958	And Saul smote the Amalekites from Havilah
c28959	<i>until</i> thou comest to Shur,
c28960	that <i>is</i> over against Egypt.
c28961	And he took Agag the king of the Amalekites alive,
c28962	and utterly destroyed all the people with the edge of the sword.
c28963	But Saul and the people spared Agag, and the best of the sheep, and of the oxen, and of the fatlings, and the lambs, and all <i>that was</i> good,
c28964	and would not
c28965	utterly destroy
c28966	them: but every thing <i>that was</i> vile and refuse,
c28967	that they destroyed utterly.
c28968	Then came the word of the LORD unto Samuel,
c28969	saying,
c28970	It repenteth me
c28971	that I have set up Saul <i>to be</i> king:
c28972	for he is turned back from following
c28973	me, and hath not performed my commandments.
c28974	And it grieved Samuel;
c28975	and he cried unto the LORD all night.
c28976	And when Samuel rose early
c28977	to meet Saul
c28978	in the morning,
c28979	it was told Samuel,
c28980	saying,
c28981	Saul came to Carmel,
c28982	and, behold, he set him up a place,
c28983	and is gone about,
c28984	and passed on,
c28985	and gone down to Gilgal.
c28986	And Samuel came to Saul:
c28987	and Saul said
c28988	unto him, Blessed <i>be</i> thou of the LORD:
c28989	I have performed the commandment of the LORD.
c28990	And Samuel said,
c28991	What <i>meaneth</i> then this bleating of the sheep in mine ears,
c28992	and the lowing of the oxen
c28993	which I hear?
c28994	And Saul said,
c28995	They have brought them from the Amalekites:
c28996	for the people spared the best of the sheep and of the oxen,
c28997	to sacrifice unto the LORD thy God;
c28998	and the rest we have utterly destroyed.
c28999	Then Samuel said unto Saul,
c29000	Stay,
c29001	and I will tell
c29002	thee what the LORD hath said to me this night.
c29003	And he said
c29004	unto him, Say on.
c29005	And Samuel said,
c29007	When thou <i>wast</i> little in thine own sight,
c29008	<i>wast</i> thou not <i>made</i> the head of the tribes of Israel,
c29009	and the LORD anointed thee king over Israel?
c29010	And the LORD sent thee on a journey,
c29011	and said,
c29012	Go
c29013	and utterly destroy the sinners the Amalekites,
c29014	and fight
c29015	against them until they be consumed.
c29016	Wherefore then didst thou not obey the voice of the LORD,
c29017	but didst fly upon the spoil,
c29018	and didst
c29019	evil in the sight of the LORD?
c29020	And Saul said unto Samuel,
c29021	Yea, I have obeyed the voice of the LORD,
c29022	and have gone the way
c29023	which the LORD sent
c29024	me, and have brought Agag the king of Amalek,
c29025	and have utterly destroyed the Amalekites.
c29026	But the people took of the spoil, sheep and oxen, the chief of the things which should have been utterly destroyed,
c29027	to sacrifice unto the LORD thy God in Gilgal.
c29028	And Samuel said,
c29029	Hath the LORD <i>as great</i> delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices,
c29030	as in obeying the voice of the LORD?
c29031	Behold,
c29032	to obey
c29033	<i>is</i> better than sacrifice,
c29034	<i>and</i> to hearken
c29035	than the fat of rams.
c29036	For rebellion <i>is as</i> the sin of witchcraft, and stubbornness <i>is as</i> iniquity
c29037	and idolatry.
c29038	Because thou hast rejected the word of the LORD,
c29039	he hath also rejected thee from <i>being</i> king.
c29040	And Saul said unto Samuel,
c29041	I have sinned:
c29042	for I have transgressed the commandment of the LORD, and thy words:
c29043	because I feared the people,
c29044	and obeyed their voice.
c29045	Now
c29046	therefore, I pray thee, pardon my sin,
c29047	and turn again with
c29048	me, that I may worship the LORD.
c29049	And Samuel said unto Saul,
c29050	I will not return with
c29051	thee: for thou hast rejected the word of the LORD,
c29052	and the LORD hath rejected
c29053	thee from being king over Israel.
c29054	And as Samuel turned about
c29055	to go away,
c29056	he laid hold upon the skirt of his mantle,
c29057	and it rent.
c29058	And Samuel said unto
c29059	him, The LORD hath rent the kingdom of Israel from thee this day,
c29060	and hath given it to a neighbour
c29061	of thine, <i>that is</i> better than thou.
c29062	And also the Strength of Israel will not lie
c29063	nor repent:
c29064	for he <i>is</i> not a man, that he
c29065	should repent.
c29066	Then he said,
c29067	I have sinned:
c29068	<i>yet</i> honour me now, I pray thee, before the elders of my people, and before Israel,
c29069	and turn again with
c29070	me, that I may worship the LORD thy God.
c29071	So Samuel turned again after Saul;
c29072	and Saul worshipped the LORD.
c29073	Then said Samuel,
c29074	Bring ye hither to me Agag the king of the Amalekites.
c29075	And Agag came unto him delicately.
c29076	And Agag said,
c29077	Surely the bitterness of death is past.
c29078	And Samuel said,
c29079	As thy sword hath made women childless,
c29080	so shall thy mother be childless among women.
c29081	And Samuel hewed Agag in pieces before the LORD in Gilgal.
c29082	Then Samuel went to Ramah;
c29083	and Saul went up to his house to Gibeah of Saul.
c29084	And Samuel came no more
c29085	to see Saul until the day of his death:
c29086	nevertheless Samuel mourned for Saul:
c29087	and the LORD repented
c29088	that he had made Saul king over Israel.
c29089	And the LORD said unto Samuel,
c29090	How long wilt thou mourn for Saul,
c29091	seeing I have rejected
c29092	him from reigning over Israel?
c29093	fill thine horn with oil,
c29094	and go,
c29095	I will send thee to Jesse the Bethlehemite:
c29096	for I have provided me a king among his sons.
c29097	And Samuel said,
c29098	How can I go?
c29099	if Saul hear
c29100	<i>it,</i> he will kill
c29101	me. And the LORD said,
c29102	Take an heifer with
c29103	thee, and say,
c29104	to sacrifice to the LORD.
c29105	I am come
c29106	And call Jesse to the sacrifice,
c29107	and I will shew
c29108	thee what thou shalt do:
c29109	and thou shalt anoint
c29110	unto me <i>him</i> whom I name unto thee.
c29111	And Samuel did
c29112	that which the LORD spake,
c29113	and came to Bethlehem.
c29114	And the elders of the town trembled
c29115	at his coming,
c29116	and said,
c29117	thou peaceably?
c29118	Comest
c29119	And he said,
c29120	Peaceably:
c29121	to sacrifice unto the LORD:
c29122	I am come
c29123	sanctify yourselves,
c29124	and come with me to the sacrifice.
c29125	And he sanctified Jesse and his sons,
c29126	and called them to the sacrifice.
c29127	And it came to pass,
c29128	when they were come,
c29129	that he looked on Eliab,
c29130	and said,
c29131	Surely the LORD'S anointed <i>is</i> before him.
c29132	But the LORD said unto Samuel,
c29133	Look not on his countenance, or on the height of his stature;
c29134	because I have refused
c29135	him: for <i>the LORD seeth</i> not
c29136	as man seeth;
c29137	for man looketh on the outward appearance,
c29138	but the LORD looketh on the heart.
c29139	Then Jesse called Abinadab,
c29140	and made him pass before Samuel.
c29141	And he said,
c29142	Neither hath the LORD chosen this.
c29143	Then Jesse made Shammah to pass by.
c29144	And he said,
c29145	Neither hath the LORD chosen this.
c29146	Again, Jesse made seven of his sons to pass before Samuel.
c29147	And Samuel said unto Jesse,
c29148	The LORD hath not chosen these.
c29149	And Samuel said unto Jesse,
c29150	Are here all <i>thy</i> children?
c29151	And he said,
c29152	There remaineth yet the youngest,
c29153	and, behold, he keepeth the sheep.
c29154	And Samuel said unto Jesse,
c29155	Send
c29156	and fetch
c29157	him: for we will not sit down
c29158	till he come hither.
c29159	And he sent,
c29160	and brought
c29161	him in. Now he <i>was</i> ruddy, <i>and</i> withal of a beautiful countenance, and goodly to look to.
c29162	And the LORD said,
c29163	Arise,
c29164	anoint
c29165	him: for this <i>is</i> he.
c29166	Then Samuel took the horn of oil,
c29167	and anointed him in the midst of his brethren:
c29168	and the Spirit of the LORD came upon David from that day forward.
c29169	So Samuel rose up,
c29170	and went to Ramah.
c29171	But the Spirit of the LORD departed from Saul,
c29172	and an evil spirit from the LORD troubled him.
c29173	And Saul's servants said unto
c29174	him, Behold now, an evil spirit from God troubleth thee.
c29175	Let our lord now command thy servants, <i>which are</i> before
c29176	thee, to seek out a man,
c29177	<i>who is</i> a cunning
c29178	player on an harp:
c29179	and it shall come to pass,
c29180	when the evil spirit from God is upon
c29181	thee, that he shall play with his hand,
c29182	and thou shalt be well.
c29183	And Saul said unto his servants,
c29184	Provide me now a man
c29185	well,
c29186	that can play
c29187	and bring <i>him</i> to me.
c29188	Then answered one of the servants,
c29189	and said,
c29190	Behold,
c29191	I have seen a son of Jesse the Bethlehemite,
c29192	<i>that is</i> cunning
c29193	in playing,
c29194	and a mighty valiant man, and a man of war, and prudent in matters, and a comely person,
c29195	and the LORD <i>is</i> with him.
c29196	Wherefore Saul sent messengers unto Jesse,
c29197	and said,
c29198	Send me David thy son,
c29199	which <i>is</i> with the sheep.
c29200	And Jesse took an ass <i>laden</i> with bread, and a bottle of wine, and a kid,
c29201	and sent <i>them</i> by David his son unto Saul.
c29202	And David came to Saul,
c29203	and stood before
c29204	him: and he loved him greatly;
c29205	and he became his armourbearer.
c29206	And Saul sent to Jesse,
c29207	saying,
c29208	Let David, I pray thee, stand before
c29209	me; for he hath found favour in my sight.
c29210	And it came to pass,
c29211	when the <i>evil</i> spirit from God was upon Saul,
c29212	that David took an harp,
c29213	and played with his hand:
c29214	so Saul was refreshed,
c29215	and was well,
c29216	and the evil spirit departed from him.
c29217	Now the Philistines gathered together their armies to battle,
c29218	and were gathered together at Shochoh,
c29219	which <i>belongeth</i> to Judah,
c29220	and pitched between Shochoh and Azekah, in Ephesdammim.
c29221	And Saul and the men of Israel were gathered together,
c29222	and pitched by the valley of Elah,
c29223	and set the battle in array
c29224	against the Philistines.
c29225	And the Philistines stood on a mountain on the one side,
c29226	and Israel stood on a mountain on the other side:
c29227	and <i>there was</i> a valley between them.
c29228	And there went out a champion out of the camp of the Philistines,
c29229	named Goliath,
c29230	of Gath,
c29231	whose height <i>was</i> six cubits and a span.
c29232	And <i>he had</i> an helmet of brass upon his head,
c29233	and he <i>was</i> armed with a coat of mail;
c29234	and the weight of the coat <i>was</i> five thousand shekels of brass.
c29235	And <i>he had</i> greaves of brass upon his legs,
c29236	and a target of brass between his shoulders.
c29237	And the staff of his spear <i>was</i> like a weaver's beam;
c29238	and his spear's head <i>weighed</i> six hundred shekels of iron:
c29239	and one bearing a shield went before him.
c29240	And he stood
c29241	and cried unto the armies of Israel,
c29242	and said
c29243	unto them, Why are ye come out
c29244	to set <i>your</i> battle in array?
c29245	<i>am</i> not I a Philistine,
c29246	and ye servants to Saul?
c29247	choose you a man
c29248	for you, and let him come down to me.
c29249	If he be able
c29250	to fight with
c29251	me, and to kill
c29252	me, then will we be your servants:
c29253	but if I prevail
c29254	against him, and kill
c29255	him, then shall ye be our servants,
c29256	and serve us.
c29257	And the Philistine said,
c29258	I defy the armies of Israel this day;
c29259	give me a man,
c29260	that we may fight together.
c29261	When Saul and all Israel heard those words of the Philistine,
c29262	they were dismayed,
c29263	and greatly afraid.
c29264	Now David <i>was</i> the son of that Ephrathite of Bethlehemjudah,
c29265	whose name <i>was</i> Jesse;
c29266	and he had eight sons:
c29267	and the man went among men <i>for</i> an old man in the days of Saul.
c29269	And the three eldest sons of Jesse went
c29270	<i>and</i> followed Saul to the battle:
c29271	and the names of his three sons
c29272	that went to the battle
c29273	<i>were</i> Eliab the firstborn,
c29274	and next unto him Abinadab,
c29275	and the third Shammah.
c29276	And David
c29277	<i>was</i> the youngest:
c29278	and the three eldest followed Saul.
c29279	But David went
c29280	and returned from Saul
c29281	to feed his father's sheep at Bethlehem.
c29282	And the Philistine drew near morning and evening,
c29283	and presented himself forty days.
c29284	And Jesse said unto David his son,
c29285	Take now for thy brethren an ephah of this parched <i>corn,</i> and these ten loaves,
c29286	and run to the camp to thy brethren;
c29287	And carry these ten cheeses unto the captain of <i>their</i> thousand,
c29288	and look how thy brethren fare,
c29289	and take their pledge.
c29290	Now Saul, and they, and all the men of Israel, <i>were</i> in the valley of Elah,
c29291	fighting with the Philistines.
c29292	And David rose up early in the morning,
c29293	and left the sheep with a keeper,
c29294	and took,
c29295	and went,
c29296	as Jesse had commanded
c29297	him; and he came to the trench,
c29298	as the host
c29299	was going forth to the fight,
c29300	and shouted for the battle.
c29301	For Israel and the Philistines had put the battle in array, army
c29302	against army.
c29303	And David left his carriage in the hand of the keeper of the carriage,
c29304	and ran into the army,
c29305	and came
c29306	and saluted his brethren.
c29307	And as he talked with
c29308	them, behold,
c29309	there came up the champion,
c29310	the Philistine of Gath, Goliath by name,
c29312	out of the armies of the Philistines,
c29313	and spake according to the same words:
c29314	and David heard <i>them.</i>
c29315	And all the men of Israel,
c29316	when they saw the man,
c29317	fled from
c29318	him, and were sore afraid.
c29319	And the men of Israel said,
c29320	Have ye seen this man that is come up?
c29321	surely
c29322	to defy Israel
c29323	is he come up:
c29324	and it shall be,
c29325	<i>that</i> the man
c29326	who killeth
c29327	him, the king will enrich him with great riches,
c29328	and will give him his daughter,
c29329	and make his father's house free in Israel.
c29330	And David spake to the men
c29331	that stood by
c29332	him, saying,
c29333	What shall be done to the man
c29334	that killeth this Philistine,
c29335	and taketh away the reproach from Israel?
c29336	for who <i>is</i> this uncircumcised Philistine,
c29337	that he should defy the armies of the living God?
c29338	And the people answered him after this manner,
c29339	saying,
c29340	So shall it be done to the man
c29341	that killeth him.
c29342	And Eliab his eldest brother heard
c29343	when he spake unto the men;
c29344	and Eliab's anger was kindled against David,
c29345	and he said,
c29346	Why camest thou down
c29347	hither? and with whom hast thou left those few sheep in the wilderness?
c29348	I know thy pride, and the naughtiness of thine heart;
c29349	for
c29350	that thou mightest see the battle.
c29351	thou art come down
c29352	And David said,
c29353	What have I now done?
c29354	<i>Is there</i> not a cause?
c29355	And he turned from him toward another,
c29356	and spake after the same manner:
c29357	and the people answered him again after the former manner.
c29358	And when the words were heard
c29359	which David spake,
c29360	they rehearsed <i>them</i> before Saul:
c29361	and he sent for him.
c29362	And David said to Saul,
c29363	Let no man's heart fail because
c29364	of him; thy servant will go
c29365	and fight with this Philistine.
c29366	And Saul said to David,
c29367	Thou art not able
c29368	to go against this Philistine
c29369	to fight with
c29370	him: for thou <i>art but</i> a youth,
c29371	and he a man of war from his youth.
c29372	And David said unto Saul,
c29373	Thy servant kept his father's sheep,
c29374	and there came a lion, and a bear,
c29375	and took a lamb out of the flock:
c29376	And I went out after
c29377	him, and smote
c29378	him, and delivered <i>it</i> out of his mouth:
c29379	and when he arose against
c29380	me, I caught <i>him</i> by his beard,
c29381	and smote
c29382	him, and slew him.
c29383	Thy servant slew both the lion and the bear:
c29384	and this uncircumcised Philistine shall be as one of
c29385	them, seeing he hath defied the armies of the living God.
c29386	David said
c29387	moreover, The LORD
c29388	that delivered me out of the paw of the lion, and out of the paw of the bear,
c29389	he will deliver me out of the hand of this Philistine.
c29390	And Saul said unto David,
c29391	Go,
c29392	and the LORD be with thee.
c29393	And Saul armed David with his armour,
c29394	and he put an helmet of brass upon his head;
c29395	also he armed him with a coat of mail.
c29396	And David girded his sword upon his armour,
c29397	and he assayed
c29398	to go;
c29399	for he had not proved
c29400	<i>it.</i> And David said unto Saul,
c29401	I cannot
c29402	go with these;
c29403	for I have not proved
c29404	<i>them.</i> And David put them off him.
c29405	And he took his staff in his hand,
c29406	and chose him five smooth stones out of the brook,
c29407	and put them in a shepherd's bag
c29408	which
c29409	he had, even in a scrip;
c29410	and his sling <i>was</i> in his hand:
c29411	and he drew near to the Philistine.
c29412	And the Philistine came
c29413	on
c29414	and drew near
c29415	unto David;
c29416	and the man
c29417	that bare the shield
c29418	<i>went</i> before him.
c29419	And when the Philistine looked about,
c29420	and saw David,
c29421	he disdained
c29422	him: for he was <i>but</i> a youth,
c29423	and ruddy, and of a fair countenance.
c29424	And the Philistine said unto David,
c29425	<i>Am</i> I a dog,
c29426	that thou comest to me with staves?
c29427	And the Philistine cursed David by his gods.
c29428	And the Philistine said to David,
c29429	Come to
c29430	me, and I will give thy flesh unto the fowls of the air, and to the beasts of the field.
c29431	Then said David to the Philistine,
c29432	Thou comest to me with a sword, and with a spear, and with a shield:
c29433	but I come to thee in the name of the LORD of hosts, the God of the armies of Israel,
c29434	whom thou hast defied.
c29435	This day will the LORD deliver thee into mine hand;
c29436	and I will smite
c29437	thee, and take thine head from
c29438	thee; and I will give the carcases of the host of the Philistines this day unto the fowls of the air, and to the wild beasts of the earth;
c29439	that all the earth may know
c29440	that there is a God in Israel.
c29441	And all this assembly shall know
c29442	that the LORD saveth not with sword and spear:
c29443	for the battle <i>is</i> the LORD'S,
c29444	and he will give you into our hands.
c29445	And it came to pass,
c29446	when the Philistine arose,
c29447	and came
c29448	and drew nigh
c29449	to meet David,
c29450	that David hasted,
c29451	and ran toward the army
c29452	to meet the Philistine.
c29453	And David put his hand in his bag,
c29454	and took thence a stone,
c29455	and slang
c29456	<i>it,</i> and smote the Philistine in his forehead,
c29457	that the stone sunk into his forehead;
c29458	and he fell upon his face to the earth.
c29459	So David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and with a stone,
c29460	and smote the Philistine,
c29461	and slew
c29462	him; but <i>there was</i> no sword in the hand of David.
c29463	Therefore David ran,
c29464	and stood upon the Philistine,
c29465	and took his sword,
c29466	and drew it out of the sheath
c29467	thereof, and slew
c29468	him, and cut off his head
c29469	therewith. And when the Philistines saw
c29470	their champion was dead,
c29471	they fled.
c29472	And the men of Israel and of Judah arose,
c29473	and shouted,
c29474	and pursued the Philistines,
c29475	until thou come to the valley,
c29476	and to the gates of Ekron.
c29477	And the wounded of the Philistines fell down by the way to Shaaraim,
c29478	even unto Gath, and unto Ekron.
c29479	And the children of Israel returned
c29480	from chasing after the Philistines,
c29481	and they spoiled their tents.
c29482	And David took the head of the Philistine,
c29483	and brought it to Jerusalem;
c29484	but he put his armour in his tent.
c29486	And when Saul saw David
c29487	go forth
c29488	against the Philistine,
c29489	he said unto Abner, the captain of the host,
c29490	whose son <i>is</i> this youth?
c29491	Abner,
c29492	And Abner said,
c29493	<i>As</i> thy soul liveth,
c29494	O king,
c29495	I cannot tell.
c29496	And the king said,
c29497	Enquire thou
c29498	whose son the stripling <i>is.</i>
c29499	And as David returned
c29500	from the slaughter of the Philistine,
c29501	Abner took
c29502	him, and brought him before Saul
c29503	with the head of the Philistine in his hand.
c29504	And Saul said to
c29505	him, Whose son <i>art</i> thou,
c29506	<i>thou</i> young man?
c29507	And David answered,
c29508	I <i>am</i> the son of thy servant Jesse the Bethlehemite.
c29509	And it came to pass,
c29510	when he had made an end
c29511	of speaking unto Saul,
c29512	that the soul of Jonathan was knit with the soul of David,
c29513	and Jonathan loved him as his own soul.
c29514	And Saul took him that day,
c29515	and would let
c29516	him go no more home to his father's house.
c29517	Then Jonathan and David made a covenant, because he loved him as his own soul.
c29518	And Jonathan stripped himself of the robe
c29519	that <i>was</i> upon
c29520	him, and gave it to David,
c29521	and his garments, even to his sword, and to his bow, and to his girdle.
c29522	And David went out
c29524	whithersoever Saul sent
c29525	him, <i>and</i> behaved himself wisely:
c29526	and Saul set him over the men of war,
c29527	and he was accepted in the sight of all the people, and also in the sight of Saul's servants.
c29528	And it came to pass
c29529	as they came,
c29530	when David was returned
c29531	from the slaughter of the Philistine,
c29532	that the women came out of all cities of Israel,
c29533	singing
c29534	and dancing,
c29535	to meet king Saul,
c29536	with tabrets, with joy, and with instruments of musick.
c29537	And the women answered <i>one another</i> as they played,
c29538	and said,
c29539	Saul hath slain his thousands,
c29540	and David his ten thousands.
c29541	And Saul was very wroth,
c29542	and the saying displeased
c29543	him; and he said,
c29544	They have ascribed unto David ten thousands,
c29545	and to me they have ascribed <i>but</i> thousands:
c29546	and <i>what</i> can he have more but the kingdom?
c29547	And Saul eyed David from that day and forward.
c29548	And it came to pass on the morrow,
c29549	that the evil spirit from God came upon Saul,
c29550	and he prophesied in the midst of the house:
c29551	and David played with his hand, as at other times:
c29552	and <i>there was</i> a javelin in Saul's hand.
c29553	And Saul cast the javelin;
c29554	for he said,
c29555	I will smite David even to the wall
c29556	<i>with it.</i> And David avoided out of his presence twice.
c29557	And Saul was afraid of David,
c29558	because the LORD was with
c29559	him, and was departed from Saul.
c29560	Therefore Saul removed him from
c29561	him, and made him his captain over a thousand;
c29562	and he went out
c29563	and came in before the people.
c29564	And David behaved himself wisely in all his ways;
c29565	and the LORD <i>was</i> with him.
c29566	Wherefore when Saul saw
c29567	that he behaved himself very wisely,
c29568	he was afraid of him.
c29569	But all Israel and Judah loved David,
c29570	because he went out
c29571	and came in before them.
c29572	And Saul said to David,
c29573	Behold my elder daughter Merab,
c29574	her will I give thee to wife:
c29575	only be thou valiant
c29576	for me, and fight the LORD'S battles.
c29577	For Saul said,
c29578	Let not mine hand be
c29579	upon him, but let the hand of the Philistines be upon him.
c29580	And David said unto Saul,
c29581	Who <i>am</i> I?
c29582	and what <i>is</i> my life, <i>or</i> my father's family in Israel,
c29583	that I should be son in law to the king?
c29584	But it came to pass at the time
c29585	when Merab Saul's daughter should have been given to David,
c29586	that she was given unto Adriel the Meholathite to wife.
c29587	And Michal Saul's daughter loved David:
c29588	and they told Saul,
c29589	and the thing pleased him.
c29590	And Saul said,
c29591	I will give
c29592	him her, that she may be a snare
c29593	to him, and that the hand of the Philistines may be
c29594	against him. Wherefore Saul said to David,
c29595	Thou shalt this day be my son in law in <i>the one of</i> the twain.
c29596	And Saul commanded his servants,
c29597	<i>saying,</i> Commune with David secretly,
c29598	and say,
c29599	Behold, the king hath delight
c29600	in thee, and all his servants love
c29601	thee: now therefore be the king's son in law.
c29602	And Saul's servants spake those words in the ears of David.
c29603	And David said,
c29604	Seemeth it to you <i>a</i> light
c29605	<i>thing</i> to be a king's son in law,
c29606	seeing that I <i>am</i> a poor man, and lightly esteemed?
c29607	And the servants of Saul told
c29608	him, saying,
c29609	On this manner spake David.
c29610	And Saul said,
c29611	Thus shall ye say to David,
c29612	The king desireth not any dowry,
c29613	but an hundred foreskins of the Philistines,
c29614	to be avenged of the king's enemies.
c29615	But Saul thought
c29616	to make David fall by the hand of the Philistines.
c29617	And when his servants told David these words,
c29618	it pleased David
c29619	well to be the king's son in law:
c29620	and the days were not expired.
c29621	Wherefore David arose
c29622	and went, he and his men,
c29623	and slew of the Philistines two hundred men;
c29624	and David brought their foreskins,
c29625	and they gave them in full tale to the king,
c29626	that he might be the king's son in law.
c29627	And Saul gave him Michal his daughter to wife.
c29628	And Saul saw
c29629	and knew
c29630	that the LORD <i>was</i> with David,
c29631	and <i>that</i> Michal Saul's daughter loved him.
c29632	And Saul was yet the more
c29633	afraid of David;
c29634	and Saul became David's enemy continually.
c29635	Then the princes of the Philistines went forth:
c29636	and it came to pass,
c29637	after they went forth,
c29638	<i>that</i> David behaved himself more wisely than all the servants of Saul;
c29639	so that his name was much set by.
c29640	And Saul spake to Jonathan his son, and to all his servants,
c29641	that they should kill David.
c29642	But Jonathan Saul's son delighted much in David: and Jonathan told David,
c29644	saying,
c29645	Saul my father seeketh
c29646	to kill
c29647	thee: now
c29648	therefore, I pray thee, take heed to thyself until the morning,
c29649	and abide in a secret
c29650	<i>place,</i> and hide thyself:
c29651	And I will go out
c29652	and stand beside my father in the field
c29653	where thou
c29654	<i>art,</i> and I will commune with my father
c29655	of thee; and what I see,
c29656	that I will tell thee.
c29657	And Jonathan spake good of David unto Saul his father,
c29658	and said unto
c29659	him, Let not the king sin against his servant, against David;
c29660	because he hath not sinned
c29661	against thee, and because his works <i>have been</i> to thee-ward very good:
c29662	For he did put his life in his hand,
c29663	and slew the Philistine,
c29664	and the LORD wrought a great salvation for all Israel:
c29665	thou sawest
c29666	<i>it,</i> and didst rejoice:
c29667	wherefore then wilt thou sin against innocent blood,
c29668	to slay David without a cause?
c29669	And Saul hearkened unto the voice of Jonathan:
c29670	and Saul sware,
c29671	<i>As</i> the LORD liveth,
c29672	he shall not be slain.
c29673	And Jonathan called David,
c29674	and Jonathan shewed him all those things.
c29675	And Jonathan brought David to Saul,
c29676	and he was in his presence, as in times past.
c29677	war again:
c29678	And there was
c29679	and David went out,
c29680	and fought with the Philistines,
c29681	and slew them with a great slaughter;
c29682	and they fled from him.
c29683	And the evil spirit from the LORD was upon Saul,
c29684	as he sat in his house
c29685	with his javelin in his hand:
c29686	and David played with <i>his</i> hand.
c29687	And Saul sought
c29688	to smite David even to the wall with the javelin;
c29689	but he slipped away out of Saul's presence,
c29690	and he smote the javelin into the wall:
c29691	and David fled,
c29692	and escaped that night.
c29693	Saul also sent messengers unto David's house,
c29694	to watch
c29695	him, and to slay him in the morning:
c29696	and Michal David's wife told
c29697	him, saying,
c29698	If thou save not thy life to night,
c29699	to morrow thou shalt be slain.
c29700	So Michal let David down through a window:
c29701	and he went,
c29702	and fled,
c29703	and escaped.
c29704	And Michal took an image,
c29705	and laid <i>it</i> in the bed,
c29706	and put a pillow of goats' <i>hair</i> for his bolster,
c29707	and covered <i>it</i> with a cloth.
c29708	And when Saul sent messengers
c29709	to take David,
c29710	she said,
c29711	He <i>is</i> sick.
c29712	And Saul sent the messengers
c29713	<i>again</i> to see David,
c29714	saying,
c29715	Bring him up to me in the bed,
c29716	that I may slay him.
c29717	And when the messengers were come in,
c29718	behold,
c29719	<i>there was</i> an image in the bed,
c29720	with a pillow of goats' <i>hair</i> for his bolster.
c29721	And Saul said unto Michal,
c29722	Why hast thou deceived me so,
c29723	and sent away mine enemy,
c29724	that he is escaped?
c29725	And Michal answered Saul,
c29726	He said unto
c29727	me, Let me go;
c29728	why should I kill thee?
c29729	So David fled,
c29730	and escaped,
c29731	and came to Samuel to Ramah,
c29732	and told him all
c29733	that Saul had done
c29734	to him. And he and Samuel went
c29735	and dwelt in Naioth.
c29736	And it was told Saul,
c29737	saying,
c29738	Behold,
c29739	David <i>is</i> at Naioth in Ramah.
c29740	And Saul sent messengers
c29741	to take David:
c29742	and when they saw the company of the prophets
c29743	prophesying,
c29744	and Samuel standing
c29745	<i>as</i> appointed over
c29746	them, the Spirit of God was upon the messengers of Saul,
c29747	and they also prophesied.
c29748	And when it was told Saul,
c29749	he sent other messengers,
c29750	and they prophesied likewise.
c29751	And Saul sent messengers again
c29752	the third
c29753	time, and they prophesied also.
c29754	Then went he also to Ramah,
c29755	and came to a great well
c29756	that <i>is</i> in Sechu:
c29757	and he asked
c29758	and said,
c29759	Where <i>are</i> Samuel and David?
c29760	And <i>one</i> said,
c29761	Behold, <i>they be</i> at Naioth in Ramah.
c29762	And he went thither to Naioth in Ramah:
c29763	and the Spirit of God was upon him also,
c29764	and he went on,
c29766	and prophesied,
c29767	until he came to Naioth in Ramah.
c29768	And he stripped off his clothes also,
c29769	and prophesied before Samuel in like manner, and lay down naked all that
c29770	day and all that night.
c29771	Wherefore they say,
c29772	<i>Is</i> Saul also among the prophets?
c29773	And David fled from Naioth in Ramah,
c29774	and came
c29775	and said before Jonathan,
c29776	What have I done?
c29777	what <i>is</i> mine iniquity?
c29778	and what <i>is</i> my sin before thy father,
c29779	that he seeketh my life?
c29780	And he said
c29781	unto him, God forbid;
c29782	thou shalt not die:
c29783	behold, my father will do nothing either great or small, but that he will shew it me:
c29785	and why should my father hide this thing from
c29786	me? it <i>is</i> not <i>so.</i>
c29787	And David sware moreover,
c29788	and said,
c29789	Thy father certainly knoweth
c29790	that I have found grace in thine eyes;
c29791	and he saith,
c29792	Let not Jonathan know this,
c29793	lest he be grieved:
c29794	but truly
c29795	<i>as</i> the LORD liveth,
c29796	and <i>as</i> thy soul liveth,
c29797	<i>there</i> <i>is</i> but a step between me and death.
c29798	Then said Jonathan unto David,
c29799	Whatsoever thy soul desireth,
c29800	I will even do <i>it</i> for thee.
c29801	And David said unto Jonathan,
c29802	Behold,
c29803	to morrow <i>is</i> the new moon,
c29804	and I should not fail to sit with the king
c29805	at meat:
c29806	but let me go,
c29807	that I may hide myself in the field unto the third <i>day</i> at even.
c29808	If thy father at all miss
c29809	me, then say,
c29810	David earnestly asked <i>leave</i> of
c29811	me that he might run to Bethlehem his city:
c29812	for <i>there is</i> a yearly sacrifice there for all the family.
c29813	If he say thus,
c29814	<i>It is</i> well;
c29815	thy servant shall have peace:
c29816	but if he be very wroth,
c29817	<i>then</i> be sure
c29818	that evil is determined by him.
c29819	Therefore thou shalt deal kindly with thy servant;
c29820	for thou hast brought thy servant into a covenant of the LORD with
c29821	thee: notwithstanding, if there be in me iniquity,
c29822	slay me thyself;
c29824	for why shouldest thou bring me to thy father?
c29826	And Jonathan said,
c29827	Far be it
c29828	from thee: for
c29829	if I knew certainly
c29830	that evil were determined by my father
c29831	to come upon
c29832	thee, then would not I tell it thee?
c29833	Then said David to Jonathan,
c29834	Who shall tell
c29835	me? or what <i>if</i> thy father answer thee roughly?
c29836	And Jonathan said unto David,
c29837	Come,
c29838	and let us go out into the field.
c29839	And they went out both of them into the field.
c29840	And Jonathan said unto David,
c29841	O LORD God of Israel,
c29842	when I have sounded my father about to morrow any time, <i>or</i> the third
c29843	<i>day,</i> and, behold, <i>if there be</i> good toward David,
c29844	and I then send not unto
c29845	thee, and shew it thee;
c29846	The LORD do so and much more to Jonathan:
c29848	but if it please my father <i>to do</i> thee evil,
c29849	then I will shew it thee,
c29850	and send thee away,
c29851	that thou mayest go in peace:
c29852	and the LORD be with
c29853	thee, as he hath been with my father.
c29854	And thou shalt not
c29855	only while yet I live
c29856	shew me the kindness of the LORD, that I die not:
c29858	But <i>also</i> thou shalt not cut off thy kindness from my house for ever:
c29859	no, not
c29860	when the LORD hath cut off the enemies of David
c29861	every one from the face of the earth.
c29862	So Jonathan made <i>a covenant</i> with the house of David,
c29863	<i>saying,</i> Let the LORD even require <i>it</i> at the hand of David's enemies.
c29864	And Jonathan caused David to swear again,
c29865	because he loved
c29866	him: for he loved him as he loved his own soul.
c29867	Then Jonathan said
c29868	to David, To morrow <i>is</i> the new moon:
c29869	and thou shalt be missed,
c29870	because thy seat will be empty.
c29871	And <i>when</i> thou hast stayed three days,
c29872	<i>then</i> thou shalt go down quickly,
c29873	and come to the place
c29874	where thou didst hide thyself when the business
c29875	was <i>in hand,</i> and shalt remain by the stone Ezel.
c29876	And I will shoot three arrows on the side
c29877	<i>thereof,</i> as though I shot at a mark.
c29878	And, behold, I will send a lad,
c29879	<i>saying,</i> Go,
c29880	find out the arrows.
c29881	If I expressly say unto the lad,
c29882	Behold, the arrows <i>are</i> on this side
c29883	of thee, take
c29884	them; then come
c29885	thou: for <i>there is</i> peace
c29886	to thee, and no hurt;
c29887	<i>as</i> the LORD liveth.
c29888	But if I say thus unto the young man,
c29889	Behold, the arrows <i>are</i> beyond
c29890	thee; go thy way:
c29891	for the LORD hath sent thee away.
c29892	And <i>as touching</i> the matter
c29893	which thou and I have spoken
c29894	of, behold, the LORD <i>be</i> between thee and me for ever.
c29895	So David hid himself in the field:
c29896	and when the new moon was come,
c29897	the king sat him down to eat meat.
c29899	And the king sat upon his seat, as at other times, <i>even</i> upon a seat by the wall:
c29900	and Jonathan arose,
c29901	and Abner sat by Saul's side,
c29902	and David's place was empty.
c29903	Nevertheless Saul spake not any thing that day:
c29904	for he thought,
c29905	Something hath befallen him, he
c29906	<i>is</i> not clean;
c29907	surely he <i>is</i> not clean.
c29908	And it came to pass on the morrow, <i>which was</i> the second <i>day</i> of the month,
c29909	that David's place was empty:
c29910	and Saul said unto Jonathan his son,
c29911	Wherefore cometh not the son of Jesse to meat, neither yesterday, nor to day?
c29912	And Jonathan answered Saul,
c29913	David earnestly asked <i>leave</i> of me <i>to go</i> to Bethlehem:
c29914	And he said,
c29915	Let me go, I pray thee;
c29916	for our family hath a sacrifice in the city;
c29918	and my brother, he hath commanded
c29919	me <i>to be there:</i> and now,
c29920	if I have found favour in thine eyes,
c29921	let me get away, I pray thee,
c29922	and see my brethren.
c29923	Therefore he cometh not unto the king's table.
c29924	Then Saul's anger was kindled against Jonathan,
c29925	and he said
c29926	unto him, Thou son of the perverse rebellious
c29927	<i>woman,</i> do not I know
c29928	that thou hast chosen the son of Jesse to thine own confusion, and unto the confusion of thy mother's nakedness?
c29929	For as long
c29930	as the son of Jesse liveth upon the ground,
c29931	thou shalt not be established, nor thy kingdom.
c29932	Wherefore now
c29933	send
c29934	and fetch him unto
c29935	me, for he shall surely die.
c29936	And Jonathan answered Saul his father,
c29937	and said unto
c29938	him, Wherefore shall he be slain?
c29939	what hath he done?
c29940	And Saul cast a javelin at
c29941	him to smite
c29942	him: whereby Jonathan knew
c29943	that it was determined of his father
c29944	to slay David.
c29945	So Jonathan arose from the table in fierce anger,
c29946	and did eat no meat the second day of the month:
c29947	for he was grieved for David,
c29948	because his father had done him shame.
c29949	And it came to pass in the morning,
c29950	that Jonathan went out into the field at the time appointed with David,
c29951	and a little lad with him.
c29952	And he said unto his lad,
c29953	Run,
c29954	find out now the arrows
c29955	which I shoot.
c29956	<i>And</i> as the lad ran,
c29957	he shot an arrow
c29958	beyond him.
c29959	And when the lad was come to the place of the arrow
c29960	which Jonathan had shot,
c29961	Jonathan cried after the lad,
c29962	and said,
c29963	<i>Is</i> not the arrow beyond thee?
c29964	And Jonathan cried after the lad,
c29965	Make speed, haste,
c29966	stay not.
c29967	And Jonathan's lad gathered up the arrows,
c29968	and came to his master.
c29969	But the lad knew not any thing:
c29970	only Jonathan and David knew the matter.
c29971	And Jonathan gave his artillery unto his lad,
c29973	and said
c29974	unto him, Go,
c29975	carry <i>them</i> to the city.
c29976	<i>And</i> as soon as the lad was gone,
c29977	David arose out of <i>a place</i> toward the south,
c29978	and fell on his face to the ground,
c29979	and bowed himself three times:
c29980	and they kissed
c29981	one another,
c29982	and wept
c29983	one with another,
c29984	until David exceeded.
c29985	And Jonathan said to David,
c29986	Go in peace,
c29987	forasmuch as we have sworn both of us in the name of the LORD,
c29988	saying,
c29989	The LORD be between me and thee, and between my seed and thy seed for ever.
c29990	And he arose
c29991	and departed:
c29992	and Jonathan went into the city.
c29993	Then came David to Nob to Ahimelech the priest:
c29994	and Ahimelech was afraid
c29995	at the meeting of David,
c29996	and said
c29997	unto him, Why <i>art</i> thou alone,
c29998	and no man with thee?
c29999	And David said unto Ahimelech the priest,
c30000	The king hath commanded me a business,
c30001	and hath said unto
c30002	me, Let no man know any thing of the business
c30003	whereabout I send
c30004	thee, and what I have commanded
c30005	thee: and I have appointed <i>my</i> servants to such and such a place.
c30006	Now
c30007	therefore what is under thine hand?
c30008	give <i>me</i> five <i>loaves of</i> bread in mine hand,
c30009	or what there is present.
c30010	And the priest answered David,
c30011	and said,
c30012	<i>There is</i> no common bread under mine hand,
c30013	but there is hallowed bread;
c30014	if the young men have kept themselves at least from women.
c30015	And David answered the priest,
c30016	and said
c30017	unto him, Of
c30018	a truth women <i>have been</i> kept from us about these three days,
c30019	since I came out,
c30020	and the vessels of the young men are holy,
c30021	and <i>the bread is</i> in a manner common,
c30022	yea, though it were sanctified this day in the vessel.
c30023	So the priest gave him hallowed
c30024	<i>bread:</i> for there was no bread there
c30025	but the shewbread,
c30026	that was taken from before the LORD,
c30027	to put hot bread in the day
c30028	when it was taken away.
c30029	Now a certain man of the servants of Saul <i>was</i> there that day,
c30030	detained before the LORD;
c30031	and his name <i>was</i> Doeg, an Edomite, the chiefest of the herdmen
c30032	that <i>belonged</i> to Saul.
c30033	And David said unto Ahimelech,
c30034	And is there not here under thine hand spear or sword?
c30035	for I have neither brought my sword nor my weapons with
c30036	me, because the king's business required haste.
c30037	And the priest said,
c30038	The sword of Goliath the Philistine,
c30039	whom thou slewest in the valley of Elah,
c30040	behold, it
c30041	<i>is here</i> wrapped in a cloth
c30042	behind the ephod:
c30043	if thou wilt take
c30044	that, take
c30045	<i>it:</i> for <i>there is</i> no other save that here.
c30046	And David said,
c30047	<i>There is</i> none
c30048	like that; give it me.
c30049	And David arose,
c30050	and fled that day for fear of Saul,
c30051	and went to Achish the king of Gath.
c30052	And the servants of Achish said unto
c30053	him, <i>Is</i> not this David the king of the land?
c30054	did they not sing one to another of him in dances,
c30055	saying,
c30056	Saul hath slain his thousands,
c30057	and David his ten thousands?
c30058	And David laid up these words in his heart,
c30059	and was sore afraid of Achish the king of Gath.
c30060	And he changed his behaviour before
c30061	them, and feigned himself mad in their hands,
c30062	and scrabbled on the doors of the gate,
c30063	and let his spittle fall down upon his beard.
c30064	Then said Achish unto his servants,
c30065	Lo, ye see the man is mad:
c30066	wherefore <i>then</i> have ye brought him to me?
c30067	Have I need of mad men,
c30068	that ye have brought this
c30069	<i>fellow</i> to play the mad man in my presence?
c30070	shall this <i>fellow</i> come into my house?
c30071	David therefore departed thence,
c30072	and escaped to the cave Adullam:
c30073	and when his brethren and all his father's house heard
c30074	<i>it,</i> they went down thither to him.
c30075	And every one <i>that was</i> in distress, and every one that <i>was</i> in debt,
c30077	and every one <i>that was</i> discontented, gathered themselves unto
c30078	him; and he became a captain over
c30079	them: and there were with him about four hundred men.
c30080	And David went thence to Mizpeh of Moab:
c30081	and he said unto the king of Moab,
c30082	Let my father and my mother, I pray thee, come forth, <i>and be</i> with
c30083	you, till I know
c30084	what God will do for me.
c30085	And he brought them before the king of Moab:
c30086	and they dwelt with him all the while
c30087	that David was in the hold.
c30088	And the prophet Gad said unto David,
c30089	Abide not in the hold;
c30090	depart,
c30091	and get thee into the land of Judah.
c30092	Then David departed,
c30093	and came into the forest of Hareth.
c30094	When Saul heard
c30095	that David was discovered, and the men
c30096	that <i>were</i> with
c30097	him, (now Saul abode in Gibeah under a tree in Ramah,
c30098	having his spear in his hand,
c30099	and all his servants <i>were</i> standing about him;)
c30100	Then Saul said unto his servants
c30101	that stood about
c30102	him, Hear now,
c30103	ye Benjamites; will the son
c30104	of Jesse give every one of you fields and vineyards,
c30105	<i>and</i> make you all captains of thousands, and captains of hundreds;
c30106	That all of you have conspired against
c30107	me, and <i>there is</i> none that sheweth
c30108	me that my son hath made a league with the son of Jesse,
c30109	and <i>there is</i> none of you that is sorry for
c30110	me, or sheweth unto
c30111	me that my son hath stirred up my servant against me, to lie in wait, as at this day?
c30112	Then answered Doeg the Edomite,
c30113	which was set over the servants of Saul,
c30114	and said,
c30115	I saw the son of Jesse
c30116	coming to Nob, to Ahimelech the son of Ahitub.
c30117	And he enquired of the LORD
c30118	for him, and gave him victuals,
c30119	and gave him the sword of Goliath the Philistine.
c30120	Then the king sent
c30121	to call Ahimelech the priest, the son of Ahitub, and all his father's house, the priests
c30122	that <i>were</i> in Nob:
c30123	and they came all of them to the king.
c30124	And Saul said,
c30125	Hear now,
c30126	thou son of Ahitub.
c30127	And he answered,
c30128	Here
c30129	I <i>am,</i> my lord.
c30130	And Saul said unto
c30131	him, Why have ye conspired against me, thou and the son of Jesse,
c30132	in that thou hast given him bread, and a sword,
c30133	and hast enquired of God
c30134	for him, that he should rise against me, to lie in wait, as at this day?
c30135	Then Ahimelech answered the king,
c30136	and said,
c30137	And who <i>is so</i> faithful among all thy servants as David,
c30139	which is the king's son in law,
c30140	and goeth at thy bidding,
c30141	and is honourable in thine house?
c30142	Did I then begin
c30143	to enquire of God
c30144	for him? be it far
c30145	from me: let not the king impute <i>any</i> thing unto his servant, <i>nor</i> to all the house of my father:
c30146	for thy servant knew nothing of all this, less or more.
c30147	And the king said,
c30148	Thou shalt surely die,
c30149	Ahimelech,
c30150	thou, and all thy father's house.
c30151	And the king said unto the footmen
c30152	that stood about
c30153	him, Turn,
c30154	and slay the priests of the LORD;
c30155	because their hand also <i>is</i> with David,
c30156	and because they knew
c30157	when he fled,
c30158	and did not shew it to me.
c30159	But the servants of the king would not
c30160	put forth their hand
c30161	to fall upon the priests of the LORD.
c30162	And the king said to Doeg,
c30163	Turn thou,
c30164	and fall upon the priests.
c30165	And Doeg the Edomite turned,
c30166	and he fell upon the priests,
c30167	and slew on that day fourscore and five persons
c30168	that did wear a linen ephod.
c30169	And Nob, the city of the priests, smote he with the edge of the sword, both men and women, children and sucklings, and oxen, and asses, and sheep, with the edge of the sword.
c30170	And one of the sons of Ahimelech the son of Ahitub, named Abiathar, escaped,
c30172	and fled after David.
c30173	And Abiathar shewed David
c30174	that Saul had slain the LORD'S priests.
c30175	And David said unto Abiathar,
c30176	I knew <i>it</i> that day,
c30177	when Doeg the Edomite <i>was</i> there,
c30178	that he would surely tell Saul:
c30179	I have occasioned <i>the death</i> of all the persons of thy father's house.
c30180	Abide thou with
c30181	me, fear not:
c30182	for
c30183	he that seeketh my life
c30184	seeketh thy life:
c30185	but with me thou <i>shalt be</i> in safeguard.
c30186	Then they told David,
c30187	saying,
c30188	Behold, the Philistines fight against Keilah,
c30189	and they rob the threshingfloors.
c30190	Therefore David enquired of the LORD,
c30191	saying,
c30192	Shall I go
c30193	and smite these Philistines?
c30194	And the LORD said unto David,
c30195	Go,
c30196	and smite the Philistines,
c30197	and save Keilah.
c30198	And David's men said unto
c30199	him, Behold, we be afraid here in Judah:
c30200	how much more then if we come to Keilah against the armies of the Philistines?
c30201	Then David enquired of the LORD yet again.
c30203	And the LORD answered
c30204	him and said,
c30205	Arise,
c30206	go down to Keilah;
c30207	for I will deliver the Philistines into thine hand.
c30208	So David and his men went to Keilah,
c30209	and fought with the Philistines,
c30210	and brought away their cattle,
c30211	and smote them with a great slaughter.
c30212	So David saved the inhabitants of Keilah.
c30213	And it came to pass,
c30214	when Abiathar the son of Ahimelech fled to David to Keilah,
c30215	<i>that</i> he came down <i>with</i> an ephod in his hand.
c30216	And it was told Saul
c30217	that David was come to Keilah.
c30218	And Saul said,
c30219	God hath delivered him into mine hand;
c30220	for he is shut in,
c30221	by entering into a town that hath gates and bars.
c30222	And Saul called all the people together to war,
c30223	to go down to Keilah,
c30224	to besiege David and his men.
c30225	And David knew
c30226	that Saul secretly practised mischief against
c30227	him; and he said to Abiathar the priest,
c30228	Bring hither the ephod.
c30229	Then said David,
c30230	O LORD God of Israel,
c30231	thy servant hath certainly heard
c30232	that Saul seeketh
c30233	to come to Keilah,
c30234	to destroy the city for my sake.
c30235	Will the men of Keilah deliver me up into his hand?
c30236	will Saul come down,
c30237	as thy servant hath heard?
c30238	O LORD God of Israel,
c30239	I beseech thee, tell thy servant.
c30240	And the LORD said,
c30241	He will come down.
c30242	Then said David,
c30243	Will the men of Keilah deliver me and my men into the hand of Saul?
c30244	And the LORD said,
c30245	They will deliver <i>thee</i> up.
c30246	Then David and his men, <i>which were</i> about six hundred, arose
c30247	and departed out of Keilah,
c30248	and went
c30249	whithersoever they could go.
c30250	And it was told Saul
c30251	that David was escaped from Keilah;
c30252	and he forbare
c30253	to go forth.
c30254	And David abode in the wilderness in strong holds,
c30255	and remained in a mountain in the wilderness of Ziph.
c30256	And Saul sought him every day,
c30257	but God delivered him not into his hand.
c30258	And David saw
c30259	that Saul was come out
c30260	to seek his life:
c30261	and David <i>was</i> in the wilderness of Ziph in a wood.
c30262	And Jonathan Saul's son arose,
c30263	and went to David into the wood,
c30264	and strengthened his hand in God.
c30265	And he said unto
c30266	him, Fear not:
c30267	for the hand of Saul my father shall not find
c30268	thee; and thou shalt be king over Israel,
c30269	and I shall be next
c30270	unto thee; and that also Saul my father knoweth.
c30271	And they two made a covenant before the LORD:
c30272	and David abode in the wood,
c30273	and Jonathan went to his house.
c30274	Then came up the Ziphites to Saul to Gibeah,
c30275	saying,
c30276	Doth not David hide himself with us in strong holds in the wood, in the hill of Hachilah,
c30277	which <i>is</i> on the south of Jeshimon?
c30278	Now
c30279	according to all the desire of thy soul
c30280	therefore, O king,
c30281	come down
c30282	to come down;
c30284	and our part <i>shall be</i> to deliver him into the king's hand.
c30285	And Saul said,
c30286	Blessed <i>be</i> ye of the LORD;
c30287	for ye have compassion on me.
c30288	Go, I pray you,
c30289	prepare yet,
c30290	and know
c30291	and see his place
c30292	where his haunt is,
c30293	<i>and</i> who hath seen him there:
c30294	for it is told
c30295	me <i>that</i> he dealeth very subtilly.
c30296	See
c30297	therefore, and take knowledge of all the lurking places
c30298	where he hideth himself,
c30299	and come ye again to me with the certainty,
c30300	and I will go with
c30301	you: and it shall come to pass,
c30302	if he be in the land,
c30303	that I will search him out throughout all the thousands of Judah.
c30304	And they arose,
c30305	and went to Ziph before Saul:
c30306	but David and his men <i>were</i> in the wilderness of Maon, in the plain on the south of Jeshimon.
c30307	Saul also and his men went
c30308	to seek
c30309	<i>him.</i> And they told David:
c30310	wherefore he came down into a rock,
c30311	and abode in the wilderness of Maon.
c30312	And when Saul heard
c30313	<i>that,</i> he pursued after David in the wilderness of Maon.
c30314	And Saul went on this side of the mountain,
c30315	and David and his men on that side of the mountain:
c30316	and David made haste
c30317	to get away for fear of Saul;
c30318	for Saul and his men compassed David and his men
c30319	round about to take them.
c30320	But there came a messenger unto Saul,
c30321	saying,
c30322	Haste
c30323	thee, and come;
c30324	for the Philistines have invaded the land.
c30325	Wherefore Saul returned
c30326	from pursuing after David,
c30327	and went
c30328	against the Philistines:
c30329	therefore they called that place Selahammahlekoth.
c30330	And David went up from thence,
c30331	and dwelt in strong holds at Engedi.
c30332	And it came to pass,
c30333	when Saul was returned from following the Philistines,
c30334	that it was told
c30335	him, saying,
c30336	Behold, David <i>is</i> in the wilderness of Engedi.
c30337	Then Saul took three thousand chosen men
c30338	out of all Israel,
c30339	and went
c30340	to seek David and his men upon the rocks of the wild goats.
c30341	And he came to the sheepcotes by the way,
c30342	where <i>was</i> a cave;
c30343	and Saul went in
c30344	to cover his feet:
c30345	and David and his men remained in the sides of the cave.
c30346	And the men of David said unto
c30347	him, Behold the day
c30348	of which the LORD said unto
c30349	thee, Behold, I will deliver thine enemy into thine hand,
c30350	that thou mayest do
c30351	to him as it shall seem good
c30352	unto thee. Then David arose,
c30353	and cut off the skirt of Saul's robe
c30355	privily.
c30356	And it came to pass afterward,
c30357	that David's heart smote
c30358	him, because he had cut off Saul's skirt.
c30360	And he said unto his men,
c30361	The LORD forbid
c30362	that I should do this thing unto my master, the LORD'S anointed,
c30363	to stretch forth mine hand
c30364	against him, seeing he <i>is</i> the anointed of the LORD.
c30365	So David stayed his servants with these words,
c30366	and suffered them not
c30367	to rise against Saul.
c30368	But Saul rose up out of the cave,
c30369	and went on <i>his</i> way.
c30370	David also arose afterward,
c30371	and went out of the cave,
c30372	and cried after Saul,
c30373	saying,
c30374	My lord the king.
c30375	And when Saul looked behind
c30376	him, David stooped
c30377	with his face to the earth,
c30378	and bowed himself.
c30379	And David said to Saul,
c30380	Wherefore hearest thou men's words,
c30381	saying,
c30382	Behold, David seeketh thy hurt?
c30383	Behold, this day thine eyes have seen
c30384	how that the LORD had delivered thee to day into mine hand in the cave:
c30385	and <i>some</i> bade
c30386	<i>me</i> kill
c30387	thee: but <i>mine eye</i> spared
c30388	thee; and I said,
c30389	I will not put forth mine hand against my lord;
c30390	for he <i>is</i> the LORD'S anointed.
c30392	Moreover, my father,
c30393	see,
c30394	yea, see the skirt of thy robe in my hand:
c30395	for
c30396	in that I cut off the skirt of thy robe,
c30397	and killed thee not,
c30398	know
c30399	thou and see
c30400	that <i>there is</i> neither evil nor transgression in mine hand,
c30401	and I have not sinned
c30402	against thee; yet thou huntest my soul
c30403	to take it.
c30404	The LORD judge between
c30405	me and thee, and the LORD avenge me of
c30406	thee: but mine hand shall not be upon thee.
c30407	As saith the proverb of the ancients,
c30408	Wickedness proceedeth from the wicked:
c30409	but mine hand shall not be upon thee.
c30410	After whom is the king of Israel come out?
c30411	after whom dost thou pursue?
c30412	after a dead dog, after a flea.
c30413	The LORD therefore be judge,
c30414	and judge between
c30415	me and thee, and see,
c30416	and plead my cause,
c30417	and deliver me out of thine hand.
c30418	And it came to pass,
c30419	when David had made an end
c30420	of speaking these words unto Saul,
c30421	that Saul said,
c30422	<i>Is</i> this thy voice,
c30423	my son David?
c30424	And Saul lifted up his voice,
c30425	and wept.
c30426	And he said to David,
c30427	Thou <i>art</i> more righteous than
c30428	I: for thou hast rewarded me good,
c30429	whereas I have rewarded thee evil.
c30430	And thou hast shewed this day
c30431	how that thou hast dealt well with
c30432	me: forasmuch as when the LORD had delivered me into thine hand,
c30433	thou killedst me not.
c30434	For if a man find his enemy,
c30435	will he let him go well away?
c30436	wherefore the LORD reward thee good for that thou hast done unto me this day.
c30438	And now,
c30439	behold, I know well
c30440	that thou shalt surely be king,
c30441	and that the kingdom of Israel shall be established in thine hand.
c30443	Swear now therefore unto me by the LORD,
c30444	that thou wilt not cut off my seed after
c30445	me, and that thou wilt not destroy my name out of my father's house.
c30446	And David sware unto Saul.
c30447	And Saul went home;
c30448	but David and his men gat them up unto the hold.
c30449	And Samuel died;
c30450	and all the Israelites were gathered together,
c30451	and lamented
c30452	him, and buried him in his house at Ramah.
c30453	And David arose,
c30454	and went down to the wilderness of Paran.
c30455	And <i>there was</i> a man in Maon,
c30456	whose possessions <i>were</i> in Carmel;
c30457	and the man <i>was</i> very great,
c30458	and he had three thousand sheep, and a thousand goats:
c30459	and he was
c30460	shearing his sheep in Carmel.
c30461	Now the name of the man <i>was</i> Nabal;
c30462	and the name of his wife Abigail:
c30463	and <i>she was</i> a woman of good understanding, and of a beautiful countenance:
c30464	but the man <i>was</i> churlish and evil in his doings;
c30465	and he <i>was</i> of the house of Caleb.
c30466	And David heard in the wilderness
c30467	that Nabal did shear his sheep.
c30468	And David sent out ten young men,
c30469	and David said unto the young men,
c30470	Get you up to Carmel,
c30471	and go to Nabal,
c30472	and greet him in my name:
c30474	And thus shall ye say to him that liveth
c30475	<i>in prosperity,</i> Peace <i>be</i> both to thee,
c30476	and peace <i>be</i> to thine house,
c30477	<i>be</i> unto all
c30478	that thou hast.
c30479	and peace
c30480	And now
c30481	I have heard
c30482	that thou hast shearers:
c30483	now thy shepherds
c30484	which
c30485	were with
c30486	us, we hurt them not,
c30487	neither was there ought missing unto them, all the while
c30488	they were in Carmel.
c30489	Ask thy young men,
c30490	and they will shew
c30491	thee. Wherefore let the young men find favour in thine eyes:
c30492	for we come in a good day:
c30493	give, I pray thee,
c30494	whatsoever cometh to thine hand
c30495	unto thy servants, and to thy son David.
c30496	And when David's young men came,
c30497	they spake to Nabal according to all those words in the name of David,
c30498	and ceased.
c30499	And Nabal answered David's servants,
c30500	and said,
c30501	Who <i>is</i> David?
c30502	and who <i>is</i> the son of Jesse?
c30503	there be many servants now a days
c30504	that break away
c30505	every man from his master.
c30506	Shall I then take my bread, and my water, and my flesh
c30507	that I have killed for my shearers,
c30508	and give <i>it</i> unto men,
c30509	whom I know not
c30510	whence they <i>be?</i>
c30511	So David's young men turned their way,
c30512	and went again,
c30513	and came
c30514	and told him all those sayings.
c30515	And David said unto his men,
c30516	Gird ye on
c30517	every man his sword.
c30518	And they girded on
c30519	every man his sword;
c30520	and David also girded on his sword:
c30521	and there went up after David about four hundred men;
c30522	and two hundred abode by the stuff.
c30523	But one of the young men told Abigail, Nabal's wife,
c30524	saying,
c30525	Behold, David sent messengers out of the wilderness
c30526	to salute our master;
c30527	and he railed on them.
c30528	But the men <i>were</i> very good
c30529	unto us, and we were not hurt,
c30530	neither missed we any thing, as long as
c30531	we were conversant with
c30532	them, when we were in the fields:
c30533	They were a wall unto us both by night and day, all the while
c30534	we were with
c30535	them keeping the sheep.
c30536	Now
c30537	therefore know
c30538	and consider
c30539	what thou wilt do;
c30540	for evil is determined against our master, and against all his household:
c30541	for he <i>is such</i> a son of Belial,
c30542	that <i>a man</i> cannot speak to him.
c30543	Then Abigail made haste,
c30544	and took two hundred loaves, and two bottles of wine, and five sheep ready dressed, and five measures of parched <i>corn,</i> and an hundred clusters of raisins, and two hundred cakes of figs,
c30545	and laid <i>them</i> on asses.
c30546	And she said unto her servants,
c30547	Go on before
c30548	me; behold, I come after
c30549	you. But she told not her husband Nabal.
c30550	And it was <i>so, as</i> she rode on the ass,
c30551	that she came down by the covert of the hill,
c30552	and, behold,
c30553	David and his men came down
c30554	against
c30555	her; and she met them.
c30556	Now David had said,
c30557	Surely in vain have I kept all
c30558	that this
c30559	<i>fellow</i> hath in the wilderness,
c30560	so that nothing was missed of all
c30561	that
c30563	<i>pertained</i> unto him: and he hath requited me evil for good.
c30564	So and more also do God unto the enemies of David,
c30566	if I leave of all
c30567	that
c30568	<i>pertain</i> to him by the morning light
c30569	any that pisseth against the wall.
c30570	And when Abigail saw David,
c30571	she hasted,
c30572	and lighted off the ass,
c30573	and fell before David on her face,
c30574	and bowed herself to the ground,
c30575	And fell at his feet,
c30576	and said,
c30577	Upon me,
c30578	my lord,
c30579	<i>upon</i> me <i>let this</i> iniquity
c30580	<i>be:</i> and let thine handmaid, I pray thee, speak in thine audience,
c30581	and hear the words of thine handmaid.
c30582	Let not my lord, I pray thee, regard this man of Belial, <i>even</i> Nabal:
c30583	for as his name <i>is,</i> so <i>is</i> he;
c30584	Nabal <i>is</i> his name,
c30585	and folly <i>is</i> with
c30586	him: but I thine handmaid saw not the young men of my lord,
c30587	whom thou didst send.
c30588	Now
c30589	therefore, my lord,
c30590	<i>as</i> the LORD liveth,
c30591	and <i>as</i> thy soul liveth,
c30592	seeing the LORD hath withholden
c30593	thee from coming to <i>shed</i> blood,
c30594	and from avenging thyself with thine own hand,
c30595	now
c30596	let thine enemies, and they that seek evil to my lord, be as Nabal.
c30598	And now
c30599	this blessing
c30600	which thine handmaid hath brought unto my lord,
c30601	let it even be given unto the young men
c30602	that follow my lord.
c30603	I pray thee, forgive the trespass of thine handmaid:
c30604	for the LORD will certainly make my lord a sure house;
c30605	because my lord fighteth the battles of the LORD,
c30606	and evil hath not been found in thee <i>all</i> thy days.
c30607	Yet a man is risen
c30608	to pursue
c30609	thee, and to seek thy soul:
c30610	but the soul of my lord shall be bound in the bundle of life with the LORD thy God;
c30611	and the souls of thine enemies,
c30612	them shall he sling out, <i>as out</i> of the middle of a sling.
c30613	And it shall come to pass,
c30614	when the LORD shall have done to my lord according to all
c30616	the good that he hath spoken concerning
c30617	thee, and shall have appointed thee ruler over Israel;
c30618	That this shall be no grief unto thee, nor offence of heart unto my lord,
c30619	either that thou hast shed blood causeless,
c30620	or that my lord hath avenged
c30621	himself: but when the LORD shall have dealt well with my lord,
c30622	then remember thine handmaid.
c30623	And David said to Abigail,
c30624	Blessed <i>be</i> the LORD God of Israel,
c30625	which sent thee this day
c30626	to meet me:
c30627	And blessed <i>be</i> thy advice,
c30628	and blessed <i>be</i> thou,
c30629	which hast kept me this day
c30630	from coming to <i>shed</i> blood,
c30631	and from avenging myself with mine own hand.
c30632	For in very deed,
c30633	<i>as</i> the LORD God of Israel liveth,
c30634	which hath kept me back
c30635	from hurting
c30636	thee, except thou hadst hasted
c30637	and come
c30638	to meet
c30639	me, surely there had not been left unto Nabal
c30640	by the morning light
c30641	any that pisseth against the wall.
c30642	So David received of her hand
c30643	<i>that</i> which she had brought
c30644	him, and said
c30645	unto her, Go up in peace to thine house;
c30646	see,
c30647	I have hearkened to thy voice,
c30648	and have accepted thy person.
c30649	And Abigail came to Nabal;
c30650	and, behold,
c30651	he held a feast in his house, like the feast of a king;
c30652	and Nabal's heart <i>was</i> merry within
c30653	him, for he <i>was</i> very drunken:
c30654	wherefore she told him nothing, less or more,
c30655	until the morning light.
c30656	But it came to pass in the morning,
c30657	when the wine was gone out of Nabal,
c30658	and his wife had told him these things,
c30659	that his heart died within
c30660	him, and he became <i>as</i> a stone.
c30661	And it came to pass about ten days
c30662	<i>after,</i> that the LORD smote Nabal,
c30663	that he died.
c30664	And when David heard
c30665	that Nabal was dead,
c30666	he said,
c30667	Blessed <i>be</i> the LORD,
c30668	that hath pleaded the cause of my reproach from the hand of Nabal,
c30669	and hath kept his servant from evil:
c30670	for the LORD hath returned the wickedness of Nabal upon his own head.
c30671	And David sent
c30672	and communed with Abigail,
c30673	to take her to him to wife.
c30674	And when the servants of David were come to Abigail to Carmel,
c30675	they spake unto
c30676	her, saying,
c30677	David sent us unto
c30678	thee, to take thee to him to wife.
c30679	And she arose,
c30680	and bowed herself
c30681	on <i>her</i> face to the earth,
c30682	and said,
c30683	Behold, <i>let</i> thine handmaid <i>be</i> a servant
c30684	to wash the feet of the servants of my lord.
c30686	And Abigail hasted, and arose,
c30687	and rode upon an ass,
c30688	with five damsels
c30689	of hers that went after
c30690	her; and she went after the messengers of David,
c30691	and became his wife.
c30692	David also took Ahinoam of Jezreel;
c30693	and they were also both of them his wives.
c30694	But Saul had given Michal his daughter, David's wife, to Phalti the son of Laish,
c30695	which <i>was</i> of Gallim.
c30696	And the Ziphites came unto Saul to Gibeah,
c30697	saying,
c30698	Doth not David hide himself in the hill of Hachilah, <i>which is</i> before Jeshimon?
c30699	Then Saul arose,
c30700	and went down to the wilderness of Ziph,
c30701	having three thousand chosen men of Israel with
c30702	him, to seek David in the wilderness of Ziph.
c30703	And Saul pitched in the hill of Hachilah,
c30704	which <i>is</i> before Jeshimon, by the way.
c30705	But David abode in the wilderness,
c30706	and he saw
c30707	that Saul came after him into the wilderness.
c30708	David therefore sent out spies,
c30709	and understood
c30710	that Saul was come in very deed.
c30711	And David arose,
c30712	and came to the place
c30713	where Saul had pitched:
c30714	and David beheld the place
c30715	where Saul lay, and Abner the son of Ner, the captain of his host:
c30716	and Saul lay in the trench,
c30717	and the people pitched round about him.
c30718	Then answered David
c30719	and said to Ahimelech the Hittite, and to Abishai the son of Zeruiah, brother to Joab,
c30720	saying,
c30721	Who will go down with me to Saul to the camp?
c30722	And Abishai said,
c30723	I will go down with thee.
c30724	So David and Abishai came to the people by night:
c30725	and, behold, Saul lay
c30726	sleeping
c30727	within the trench,
c30728	and his spear stuck in the ground at his bolster:
c30729	but Abner and the people lay round about him.
c30730	Then said Abishai to David,
c30731	God hath delivered thine enemy into thine hand this day:
c30732	now
c30733	therefore let me smite him, I pray thee, with the spear even to the earth at once,
c30734	and I will not <i>smite</i> him the second time.
c30735	And David said to Abishai,
c30736	Destroy him not:
c30737	for who can stretch forth his hand against the LORD'S anointed,
c30738	and be guiltless?
c30739	David said
c30741	furthermore, <i>As</i> the LORD liveth, the LORD shall smite
c30742	him; or his day shall come
c30743	to die;
c30744	or he shall descend into battle,
c30745	and perish.
c30746	The LORD forbid
c30747	that I should stretch forth mine hand against the LORD'S anointed:
c30749	but, I pray thee, take thou now the spear
c30750	that <i>is</i> at his bolster,
c30751	and the cruse of water,
c30752	and let us go.
c30753	So David took the spear and the cruse of water from Saul's bolster;
c30754	and they gat them away,
c30755	and no man saw
c30756	<i>it,</i> nor knew
c30757	<i>it,</i> neither awaked:
c30758	for they <i>were</i> all asleep;
c30759	because a deep sleep from the LORD was fallen upon them.
c30760	Then David went over to the other side,
c30761	and stood on the top of an hill afar off;
c30762	a great space <i>being</i> between them:
c30763	And David cried to the people, and to Abner the son of Ner,
c30764	saying,
c30765	Answerest thou not,
c30766	Abner?
c30767	Then Abner answered
c30768	and said,
c30769	Who <i>art</i> thou
c30770	<i>that</i> criest to the king?
c30771	And David said to Abner,
c30772	<i>Art</i> not thou a <i>valiant</i> man?
c30773	and who <i>is</i> like to thee in Israel?
c30774	wherefore then hast thou not kept thy lord the king?
c30775	for there came one of the people
c30776	in to destroy the king thy lord.
c30777	This thing <i>is</i> not good
c30778	that thou hast done.
c30779	<i>As</i> the LORD liveth,
c30780	ye <i>are</i> worthy to die,
c30781	because ye have not kept your master, the LORD'S anointed.
c30782	And now see
c30783	where the king's spear <i>is,</i> and the cruse of water
c30784	that <i>was</i> at his bolster.
c30785	And Saul knew David's voice,
c30786	and said,
c30787	<i>Is</i> this thy voice,
c30788	my son David?
c30789	And David said,
c30790	<i>It is</i> my voice,
c30791	my lord, O king.
c30792	And he said,
c30793	Wherefore doth my lord thus pursue after his servant?
c30794	for what have I done?
c30795	or what evil <i>is</i> in mine hand?
c30796	Now
c30797	therefore, I pray thee, let my lord the king hear the words of his servant.
c30798	If the LORD have stirred thee up
c30799	against me, let him accept an offering:
c30800	but if <i>they be</i> the children of men,
c30801	cursed <i>be</i> they before the LORD;
c30802	for they have driven me out this day
c30803	from abiding in the inheritance of the LORD,
c30804	saying,
c30805	Go,
c30806	serve other gods.
c30807	Now
c30808	therefore, let not my blood fall to the earth before the face of the LORD:
c30809	for the king of Israel is come out
c30810	to seek a flea, as when one
c30811	doth hunt a partridge in the mountains.
c30812	Then said Saul,
c30813	I have sinned:
c30814	return,
c30815	my son David:
c30816	for I will no more do thee harm,
c30817	because my soul was precious in thine eyes this day:
c30818	behold, I have played the fool,
c30819	and have erred exceedingly.
c30820	And David answered
c30821	and said,
c30822	Behold the king's spear!
c30823	and let one of the young men come over
c30824	and fetch it.
c30825	The LORD render to every man his righteousness and his faithfulness:
c30826	for the LORD delivered thee into <i>my</i> hand to day,
c30827	but I would not
c30828	stretch forth mine hand against the LORD'S anointed.
c30829	And, behold,
c30830	as thy life was much set by this day in mine eyes,
c30831	so let my life be much set by in the eyes of the LORD,
c30832	and let him deliver me out of all tribulation.
c30833	Then Saul said to David,
c30834	Blessed <i>be</i> thou,
c30835	my son David:
c30836	thou shalt both do great
c30837	<i>things,</i> and also shalt still prevail.
c30838	So David went on his way,
c30839	and Saul returned to his place.
c30840	And David said in his heart,
c30841	I shall now perish one day by the hand of Saul:
c30842	<i>there is</i> nothing better
c30843	for me than that I should speedily escape into the land of the Philistines;
c30844	and Saul shall despair of
c30845	me, to seek me any more in any coast of Israel:
c30846	so shall I escape out of his hand.
c30847	And David arose,
c30848	and he passed over with the six hundred men
c30849	that <i>were</i> with
c30850	him unto Achish, the son of Maoch, king of Gath.
c30851	And David dwelt with Achish at Gath, he and his men, every man with his household, <i>even</i> David with his two wives, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail the Carmelitess, Nabal's wife.
c30852	And it was told Saul
c30853	that David was fled to Gath:
c30854	no more again for him.
c30855	and he sought
c30856	And David said unto Achish,
c30857	If I have now found grace in thine eyes,
c30858	let them give me a place in some town in the country,
c30859	that I may dwell there:
c30860	for why should thy servant dwell in the royal city with thee?
c30861	Then Achish gave him Ziklag that day:
c30862	wherefore Ziklag pertaineth unto the kings of Judah unto this day.
c30863	And the time that David dwelt in the country of the Philistines was a full
c30865	year and four months.
c30866	And David and his men went up,
c30867	and invaded the Geshurites, and the Gezrites, and the Amalekites:
c30868	for those <i>nations were</i> of old the inhabitants of the land,
c30870	as thou goest to Shur, even unto the land of Egypt.
c30871	And David smote the land,
c30872	and left neither man nor woman
c30873	alive, and took away the sheep, and the oxen, and the asses, and the camels, and the apparel,
c30874	and returned,
c30875	and came to Achish.
c30876	And Achish said,
c30877	Whither have ye made a road to day?
c30878	And David said,
c30879	Against the south of Judah, and against the south of the Jerahmeelites, and against the south of the Kenites.
c30880	And David saved neither man nor woman
c30881	alive, to bring <i>tidings</i> to Gath,
c30882	saying,
c30883	Lest they should tell on
c30884	us, saying,
c30885	So did David,
c30886	and so <i>will be</i> his manner all the while
c30887	he dwelleth in the country of the Philistines.
c30888	And Achish believed David,
c30889	saying,
c30890	He hath made his people Israel utterly to abhor
c30891	him; therefore he shall be my servant for ever.
c30892	And it came to pass in those days,
c30893	that the Philistines gathered their armies together for warfare,
c30894	to fight with Israel.
c30895	And Achish said unto David,
c30896	Know thou assuredly,
c30897	that thou shalt go out with me to battle, thou and thy men.
c30898	And David said to Achish,
c30899	Surely thou shalt know
c30900	what thy servant can do.
c30901	And Achish said to David,
c30902	Therefore will I make thee keeper of mine head for ever.
c30903	Now Samuel was dead,
c30904	and all Israel had lamented
c30905	him, and buried him in Ramah, even in his own city.
c30906	And Saul had put away those that had familiar spirits, and the wizards, out of the land.
c30907	And the Philistines gathered themselves together,
c30908	and came
c30909	and pitched in Shunem:
c30910	and Saul gathered all Israel together,
c30911	and they pitched in Gilboa.
c30912	And when Saul saw the host of the Philistines,
c30913	he was afraid,
c30914	and his heart greatly trembled.
c30915	And when Saul enquired of the LORD,
c30916	the LORD answered him not, neither by dreams, nor by Urim, nor by prophets.
c30917	Then said Saul unto his servants,
c30918	Seek me a woman that hath a familiar spirit,
c30919	that I may go to
c30920	her, and enquire
c30921	of her. And his servants said to
c30922	him, Behold, <i>there is</i> a woman that hath a familiar spirit at Endor.
c30923	And Saul disguised himself,
c30924	and put on other raiment,
c30925	and he went, and two men with
c30926	him, and they came to the woman by night:
c30927	and he said,
c30928	I pray thee, divine unto me by the familiar spirit,
c30929	and bring
c30930	me <i>him</i> up, whom I shall name unto thee.
c30931	And the woman said unto
c30932	him, Behold,
c30933	thou knowest
c30934	what Saul hath done,
c30935	how he hath cut off those that have familiar spirits, and the wizards, out of the land:
c30936	wherefore then layest thou a snare for my life,
c30937	to cause me to die?
c30938	And Saul sware to her by the LORD,
c30939	saying,
c30940	<i>As</i> the LORD liveth,
c30941	there shall no punishment happen to thee for this thing.
c30942	Then said the woman,
c30943	Whom shall I bring up
c30944	unto thee? And he said,
c30945	Bring me up Samuel.
c30946	And when the woman saw Samuel,
c30947	she cried with a loud voice:
c30948	and the woman spake to Saul,
c30949	saying,
c30950	Why hast thou deceived
c30951	me? for thou <i>art</i> Saul.
c30952	And the king said
c30953	unto her, Be not afraid:
c30954	for what sawest
c30955	thou? And the woman said unto Saul,
c30956	I saw gods
c30957	ascending out of the earth.
c30958	And he said
c30959	unto her, What form
c30960	<i>is</i> he of? And she said,
c30961	An old man cometh up;
c30962	and he <i>is</i> covered with a mantle.
c30963	And Saul perceived
c30964	that it <i>was</i> Samuel, and he
c30965	stooped
c30966	with <i>his</i> face to the ground,
c30967	and bowed himself.
c30968	And Samuel said to Saul,
c30969	Why hast thou disquieted
c30970	me, to bring me up?
c30971	And Saul answered,
c30972	I am sore distressed;
c30973	for the Philistines make war
c30974	against me, and God is departed from
c30975	me, and answereth me no more, neither by prophets, nor by dreams:
c30976	therefore I have called
c30977	thee, that thou mayest make known
c30978	unto me what I shall do.
c30979	Then said Samuel,
c30980	Wherefore then dost thou ask
c30981	of me, seeing the LORD is departed from
c30982	thee, and is become thine enemy?
c30983	And the LORD hath done
c30984	to him, as he spake by
c30985	me: for the LORD hath rent the kingdom out of thine hand,
c30986	and given it to thy neighbour, <i>even</i> to David:
c30987	Because thou obeyedst not the voice of the LORD,
c30988	nor executedst his fierce wrath upon Amalek,
c30989	therefore hath the LORD done this thing unto thee this day.
c30990	Moreover the LORD will also deliver Israel with thee into the hand of the Philistines:
c30991	and to morrow <i>shalt</i> thou and thy sons <i>be</i> with
c30992	me: the LORD also shall deliver the host of Israel into the hand of the Philistines.
c30993	Then Saul fell straightway
c30994	all along on the earth,
c30995	and was sore afraid, because of the words of Samuel:
c30996	and there was no strength
c30997	in him; for he had eaten no bread all the day, nor all the night.
c30998	And the woman came unto Saul,
c30999	and saw
c31000	that he was sore troubled,
c31001	and said unto
c31002	him, Behold, thine handmaid hath obeyed thy voice,
c31003	and I have put my life in my hand,
c31004	and have hearkened unto thy words
c31005	which thou spakest unto me.
c31006	Now
c31007	therefore, I pray thee, hearken thou also unto the voice of thine handmaid,
c31008	and let me set a morsel of bread before
c31009	thee; and eat,
c31010	that thou mayest have strength,
c31011	when thou goest on thy way.
c31012	But he refused,
c31013	and said,
c31014	I will not eat.
c31015	But his servants, together with the woman, compelled
c31016	him; and he hearkened unto their voice.
c31017	So he arose from the earth,
c31018	and sat upon the bed.
c31019	And the woman had a fat calf in the house;
c31020	and she hasted,
c31021	and killed
c31022	it, and took flour,
c31023	and kneaded
c31024	<i>it,</i> and did bake unleavened bread thereof:
c31025	And she brought <i>it</i> before Saul, and before his servants;
c31026	and they did eat.
c31027	Then they rose up,
c31028	and went away that night.
c31029	Now the Philistines gathered together all their armies to Aphek:
c31030	and the Israelites pitched by a fountain
c31031	which <i>is</i> in Jezreel.
c31032	And the lords of the Philistines passed on by hundreds, and by thousands:
c31033	but David and his men passed on in the rereward with Achish.
c31034	Then said the princes of the Philistines,
c31035	What <i>do</i> these Hebrews
c31036	<i>here?</i> And Achish said unto the princes of the Philistines,
c31037	<i>Is</i> not this David, the servant of Saul the king of Israel,
c31038	which hath been with me these days, or these years,
c31039	and I have found no fault in him since
c31040	he fell
c31041	<i>unto me</i> unto this day?
c31042	And the princes of the Philistines were wroth with
c31043	him; and the princes of the Philistines said
c31044	unto him, Make this fellow return,
c31045	that he may go again to his place
c31046	which thou hast appointed
c31047	him, and let him not go down with us to battle,
c31048	lest in the battle he be an adversary
c31049	to us: for wherewith should he reconcile himself unto his master?
c31050	<i>should it</i> not <i>be</i> with the heads of these men?
c31051	<i>Is</i> not this David,
c31052	of whom they sang one to another in dances,
c31053	saying,
c31054	Saul slew his thousands,
c31055	and David his ten thousands?
c31056	Then Achish called David,
c31057	and said unto
c31058	him, Surely, <i>as</i> the LORD liveth,
c31059	thou hast been upright, and thy going out
c31060	<i>is</i> good in my sight: for
c31062	and thy coming in with me in the host
c31063	I have not found evil in thee since the day
c31064	of thy coming unto
c31065	me unto this day:
c31066	nevertheless the lords favour thee not.
c31067	Wherefore now
c31068	return,
c31069	and go in peace,
c31070	that thou displease not the lords of the Philistines.
c31071	And David said unto Achish,
c31072	But what have I done?
c31073	and what hast thou found in thy servant so long
c31074	as I have been with
c31075	thee unto this day,
c31076	that I may not go
c31077	fight against the enemies of my lord the king?
c31078	And Achish answered
c31079	and said to David,
c31080	I know
c31081	that thou <i>art</i> good in my sight, as an angel of God:
c31082	notwithstanding the princes of the Philistines have said,
c31083	He shall not go up with us to the battle.
c31084	Wherefore now
c31085	rise up early in the morning
c31086	with thy master's servants
c31087	that are come with
c31088	thee: and as soon as ye be up early in the morning,
c31089	and have light,
c31090	depart.
c31091	So David and his men rose up early
c31092	to depart
c31093	in the morning,
c31094	to return into the land of the Philistines.
c31095	And the Philistines went up to Jezreel.
c31096	And it came to pass,
c31097	when David and his men were come to Ziklag on the third day,
c31098	that the Amalekites had invaded the south, and Ziklag,
c31099	and smitten Ziklag,
c31100	and burned it with fire;
c31101	And had taken the women captives,
c31102	that
c31103	either great or small,
c31104	<i>were</i> therein: they slew not any,
c31105	but carried <i>them</i> away,
c31106	and went on their way.
c31107	So David and his men came to the city,
c31108	and, behold, <i>it was</i> burned with fire;
c31109	and their wives, and their sons, and their daughters, were taken captives.
c31110	Then David and the people that <i>were</i> with him lifted up
c31112	their voice
c31113	and wept,
c31114	until they had no more power
c31115	to weep.
c31116	And David's two wives were taken captives, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite.
c31117	And David was greatly distressed;
c31118	for the people spake
c31119	of stoning
c31120	him, because the soul of all the people was grieved,
c31121	every man for his sons and for his daughters:
c31122	but David encouraged himself in the LORD his God.
c31123	And David said to Abiathar the priest, Ahimelech's son,
c31124	I pray thee, bring me hither the ephod.
c31125	And Abiathar brought thither the ephod to David.
c31126	And David enquired at the LORD,
c31127	saying,
c31128	Shall I pursue after this troop?
c31129	shall I overtake
c31130	them? And he answered
c31131	him, Pursue:
c31132	for thou shalt surely overtake
c31133	<i>them,</i> and without fail recover <i>all.</i>
c31134	So David went, he and the six hundred men
c31135	that <i>were</i> with
c31136	him, and came to the brook Besor,
c31137	where those that were left behind stayed.
c31138	But David pursued, he and four hundred men:
c31139	for two hundred abode behind,
c31140	which were so faint
c31141	that they could not go over the brook Besor.
c31142	And they found an Egyptian in the field,
c31143	and brought him to David,
c31144	and gave him bread,
c31145	and he did eat;
c31146	and they made him drink water;
c31147	And they gave him a piece of a cake of figs, and two clusters of raisins:
c31148	and when he had eaten,
c31149	his spirit came again to
c31150	him: for he had eaten no bread,
c31151	nor drunk <i>any</i> water, three days and three nights.
c31152	And David said
c31153	unto him, To whom <i>belongest</i> thou?
c31154	and whence <i>art</i> thou?
c31155	And he said,
c31156	I <i>am</i> a young man of Egypt,
c31157	servant to an Amalekite;
c31158	and my master left
c31159	me, because three days agone I fell sick.
c31160	We made an invasion <i>upon</i> the south of the Cherethites,
c31161	and upon <i>the coast</i> which <i>belongeth</i> to Judah,
c31162	and upon the south of Caleb;
c31163	and we burned Ziklag with fire.
c31164	And David said to
c31165	him, Canst thou bring me down to this company?
c31166	And he said,
c31167	Swear unto me by God,
c31168	that thou wilt neither kill
c31169	me, nor deliver me into the hands of my master,
c31170	and I will bring thee down to this company.
c31171	And when he had brought him down,
c31172	behold, <i>they were</i> spread abroad upon all the earth,
c31173	eating
c31174	and drinking,
c31175	and dancing, because of all the great spoil
c31176	that they had taken out of the land of the Philistines, and out of the land of Judah.
c31177	And David smote them from the twilight even unto the evening of the next day:
c31178	and there escaped not a man
c31179	of them, save four hundred young men,
c31180	which rode upon camels,
c31181	and fled.
c31182	And David recovered all
c31183	that the Amalekites had carried away:
c31184	and David rescued his two wives.
c31185	And there was nothing lacking to them, neither small nor great, neither sons nor daughters, neither spoil, nor any
c31186	<i>thing</i> that they had taken
c31187	to them: David recovered all.
c31188	And David took all the flocks and the herds,
c31189	<i>which</i> they drave before those <i>other</i> cattle,
c31190	and said,
c31191	This <i>is</i> David's spoil.
c31192	And David came to the two hundred men,
c31193	which were so faint
c31194	that they could not follow David,
c31195	whom they had made also to abide at the brook Besor:
c31196	and they went forth
c31197	to meet David,
c31198	and to meet the people
c31199	that <i>were</i> with
c31200	him: and when David came near to the people,
c31201	he saluted them.
c31202	Then answered all the wicked men and <i>men</i> of Belial, of those
c31203	that went with David,
c31204	and said,
c31205	Because they went not with
c31206	us, we will not give them <i>ought</i> of the spoil
c31207	that we have recovered,
c31208	save to every man his wife and his children,
c31209	that they may lead <i>them</i> away,
c31210	and depart.
c31211	Then said David,
c31212	Ye shall not do so,
c31213	my brethren,
c31214	with that which the LORD hath given
c31215	us, who hath preserved
c31216	us, and delivered the company
c31217	that came against
c31218	us into our hand.
c31219	For who will hearken unto you in this matter?
c31220	but as his part
c31221	<i>is</i> that goeth down to the battle,
c31222	so <i>shall</i> his part
c31223	<i>be</i> that tarrieth by the stuff:
c31224	they shall part alike.
c31225	And it was <i>so</i> from that day forward,
c31226	that he made it a statute and an ordinance for Israel unto this day.
c31227	And when David came to Ziklag,
c31228	he sent of the spoil unto the elders of Judah, <i>even</i> to his friends,
c31229	saying,
c31230	Behold a present for you of the spoil of the enemies of the LORD;
c31231	To <i>them</i> which <i>were</i> in Bethel,
c31232	and to <i>them</i> which <i>were</i> in south Ramoth,
c31233	and to <i>them</i> which <i>were</i> in Jattir,
c31234	And to <i>them</i> which <i>were</i> in Aroer,
c31235	and to <i>them</i> which <i>were</i> in Siphmoth,
c31236	and to <i>them</i> which <i>were</i> in Eshtemoa,
c31237	And to <i>them</i> which <i>were</i> in Rachal,
c31238	and to <i>them</i> which <i>were</i> in the cities of the Jerahmeelites,
c31239	and to <i>them</i> which <i>were</i> in the cities of the Kenites,
c31240	And to <i>them</i> which <i>were</i> in Hormah,
c31241	and to <i>them</i> which <i>were</i> in Chorashan,
c31242	and to <i>them</i> which <i>were</i> in Athach,
c31243	And to <i>them</i> which <i>were</i> in Hebron,
c31244	and to all the places
c31245	where David himself and his men were wont to haunt.
c31246	Now the Philistines fought against Israel:
c31247	and the men of Israel fled from before the Philistines,
c31248	and fell down slain in mount Gilboa.
c31249	And the Philistines followed hard upon Saul and upon his sons;
c31250	and the Philistines slew Jonathan, and Abinadab, and Malchishua, Saul's sons.
c31251	And the battle went sore against Saul,
c31252	and the archers hit
c31253	him; and he was sore wounded of the archers.
c31254	Then said Saul unto his armourbearer,
c31255	Draw thy sword,
c31256	and thrust me through
c31257	therewith; lest these uncircumcised come
c31258	and thrust me through,
c31259	and abuse
c31260	me. But his armourbearer would not;
c31261	for he was sore afraid.
c31262	Therefore Saul took a sword,
c31263	and fell upon it.
c31264	And when his armourbearer saw
c31265	that Saul was dead,
c31266	he fell likewise upon his sword,
c31267	and died with him.
c31268	So Saul died, and his three sons, and his armourbearer, and all his men, that same day together.
c31269	And when the men of Israel that <i>were</i> on the other side of the valley,
c31271	and <i>they</i> that <i>were</i> on the other side Jordan, saw
c31272	that the men of Israel fled,
c31273	and that Saul and his sons were dead,
c31274	they forsook the cities,
c31275	and fled;
c31276	and the Philistines came
c31277	and dwelt in them.
c31278	And it came to pass on the morrow,
c31279	when the Philistines came
c31280	to strip the slain,
c31281	that they found Saul and his three sons
c31282	fallen in mount Gilboa.
c31283	And they cut off his head,
c31284	and stripped off his armour,
c31285	and sent into the land of the Philistines round about,
c31286	to publish <i>it in</i> the house of their idols, and among the people.
c31287	And they put his armour in the house of Ashtaroth:
c31288	and they fastened his body to the wall of Bethshan.
c31289	And when the inhabitants of Jabeshgilead heard
c31290	of that which the Philistines had done to Saul;
c31291	All the valiant men arose,
c31292	and went all night,
c31293	and took the body of Saul and the bodies of his sons from the wall of Bethshan,
c31294	and came to Jabesh,
c31295	and burnt them there.
c31296	And they took their bones,
c31297	and buried <i>them</i> under a tree at Jabesh,
c31298	and fasted seven days.
c31299	Now it came to pass after the death of Saul,
c31300	when David was returned
c31301	from the slaughter of the Amalekites,
c31302	and David had abode two days in Ziklag;
c31303	It came even to pass on the third day,
c31304	that, behold, a man came out of the camp from Saul
c31305	with his clothes rent,
c31306	and earth upon his head:
c31307	and <i>so</i> it was,
c31308	when he came to David,
c31309	that he fell to the earth,
c31310	and did obeisance.
c31311	And David said
c31312	unto him, From whence comest
c31313	thou? And he said unto
c31314	him, Out of the camp of Israel am I escaped.
c31315	And David said unto
c31316	him, How went the matter?
c31317	I pray thee, tell
c31318	me. And he answered,
c31319	That the people are fled from the battle,
c31320	and many of the people also are fallen
c31321	and dead;
c31322	and Saul and Jonathan his son are dead also.
c31323	And David said unto the young man
c31324	that told
c31325	him, How knowest
c31326	thou that Saul and Jonathan his son be dead?
c31327	And the young man that told him said,
c31329	As I happened by chance upon mount Gilboa,
c31330	behold, Saul leaned upon his spear;
c31331	and, lo, the chariots and horsemen followed hard after him.
c31332	And when he looked behind
c31333	him, he saw
c31334	me, and called unto
c31335	me. And I answered,
c31336	Here <i>am</i> I.
c31337	And he said
c31338	unto me, Who <i>art</i> thou?
c31339	And I answered him,
c31340	I <i>am</i> an Amalekite.
c31341	He said unto
c31342	me again, Stand, I pray thee, upon
c31343	me, and slay
c31344	me: for anguish is come
c31345	upon me, because my life <i>is</i> yet whole in me.
c31346	So I stood upon
c31347	him, and slew
c31348	him, because I was sure
c31349	that he could not live
c31350	after that he was fallen:
c31351	and I took the crown
c31352	that <i>was</i> upon his head,
c31353	and the bracelet
c31354	that <i>was</i> on his arm,
c31355	and have brought them hither unto my lord.
c31356	Then David took hold on his clothes,
c31357	and rent
c31358	them; and likewise all the men
c31359	that <i>were</i> with him:
c31360	And they mourned,
c31361	and wept,
c31362	and fasted until even, for Saul, and for Jonathan his son, and for the people of the LORD, and for the house of Israel;
c31363	because they were fallen by the sword.
c31364	And David said unto the young man
c31365	that told
c31366	him, Whence <i>art</i> thou?
c31367	And he answered,
c31368	I <i>am</i> the son of a stranger, an Amalekite.
c31369	And David said unto
c31370	him, How wast thou not afraid
c31371	to stretch forth thine hand
c31372	to destroy the LORD'S anointed?
c31373	And David called one of the young men,
c31374	and said,
c31375	Go near,
c31376	<i>and</i> fall
c31377	upon him. And he smote
c31378	him that he died.
c31379	And David said unto
c31380	him, Thy blood <i>be</i> upon thy head;
c31381	for thy mouth hath testified
c31382	against thee, saying,
c31383	I have slain the LORD'S anointed.
c31384	And David lamented with this lamentation over Saul and over Jonathan his son:
c31385	(Also he bade
c31386	them teach the children of Judah <i>the use of</i> the bow:
c31387	behold, <i>it is</i> written in the book of Jasher.)
c31388	The beauty
c31389	of Israel
c31390	is slain upon thy high places:
c31391	how are the mighty fallen!
c31392	Tell <i>it</i> not in Gath,
c31393	publish <i>it</i> not in the streets of Askelon;
c31394	lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice,
c31395	lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph.
c31396	Ye mountains of Gilboa,
c31397	<i>let there be</i> no dew,
c31398	neither <i>let there be</i> rain, upon
c31399	you, nor fields of offerings:
c31400	for there the shield of the mighty is vilely cast away,
c31401	the shield of Saul, <i>as though he had</i> not <i>been</i> anointed with oil.
c31402	From the blood of the slain, from the fat of the mighty, the bow of Jonathan turned not back,
c31403	and the sword of Saul returned not empty.
c31404	Saul and Jonathan <i>were</i> lovely and pleasant
c31405	in their lives, and in their death they were not divided:
c31406	they were swifter than eagles,
c31407	they were stronger than lions.
c31408	Ye daughters of Israel,
c31409	weep over Saul,
c31410	who clothed you in scarlet, with <i>other</i> delights,
c31411	who put on ornaments of gold upon your apparel.
c31412	How are the mighty fallen in the midst of the battle!
c31413	O Jonathan, <i>thou wast</i> slain in thine high places.
c31414	I am distressed for
c31415	thee, my brother Jonathan:
c31416	very pleasant
c31417	hast thou been unto me: thy love to me was wonderful, passing the love of women.
c31418	How are the mighty fallen,
c31419	and the weapons of war perished!
c31420	And it came to pass after this,
c31421	that David enquired of the LORD,
c31422	saying,
c31423	Shall I go up into any of the cities of Judah?
c31424	And the LORD said unto
c31425	him, Go up.
c31426	And David said,
c31427	Whither shall I go up?
c31428	And he said,
c31429	Unto Hebron.
c31430	So David went up thither, and his two wives also, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail Nabal's wife the Carmelite.
c31431	And his men
c31432	that <i>were</i> with
c31433	him did David bring up,
c31434	every man with his household:
c31435	and they dwelt in the cities of Hebron.
c31436	And the men of Judah came,
c31437	and there they anointed David king over the house of Judah.
c31438	And they told David,
c31439	saying,
c31440	<i>That</i> the men of Jabeshgilead
c31441	<i>were they</i> that buried Saul.
c31442	And David sent messengers unto the men of Jabeshgilead,
c31443	and said unto
c31444	them, Blessed <i>be</i> ye of the LORD,
c31445	that ye have shewed this kindness unto your lord, <i>even</i> unto Saul,
c31446	and have buried him.
c31447	And now
c31448	the LORD shew kindness and truth unto
c31449	you: and I also will requite you this kindness,
c31450	because ye have done this thing.
c31451	Therefore now
c31452	let your hands be strengthened,
c31453	and be ye valiant:
c31454	for your master Saul is dead,
c31455	and also the house of Judah have anointed me king over them.
c31456	But Abner the son of Ner, captain of Saul's host,
c31458	took Ishbosheth the son of Saul,
c31459	and brought him over to Mahanaim;
c31460	And made him king over Gilead, and over the Ashurites, and over Jezreel, and over Ephraim, and over Benjamin, and over all Israel.
c31461	Ishbosheth Saul's son <i>was</i> forty years old
c31462	when he began to reign over Israel,
c31463	and reigned two years.
c31464	But the house of Judah followed David.
c31465	And the time that David was
c31466	king in Hebron over the house of Judah was
c31467	seven years and six months.
c31468	And Abner the son of Ner, and the servants of Ishbosheth the son of Saul, went out from Mahanaim to Gibeon.
c31469	And Joab the son of Zeruiah, and the servants of David, went out,
c31470	and met together by the pool of Gibeon:
c31471	and they sat down, the one on the one side of the pool,
c31472	and the other on the other side of the pool.
c31473	And Abner said to Joab,
c31474	Let the young men now arise,
c31475	and play before
c31476	us. And Joab said,
c31477	Let them arise.
c31478	Then there arose
c31479	and went over by number twelve of Benjamin, which <i>pertained</i> to Ishbosheth the son of Saul, and twelve of the servants of David.
c31480	And they caught
c31481	every one his fellow by the head,
c31482	and <i>thrust</i> his sword in his fellow's side;
c31483	so they fell down together:
c31484	wherefore that place was called Helkathhazzurim,
c31485	which <i>is</i> in Gibeon.
c31486	And there was a very sore battle that day;
c31487	and Abner was beaten, and the men of Israel, before the servants of David.
c31488	And there were three sons of Zeruiah there, Joab, and Abishai, and Asahel:
c31489	and Asahel <i>was as</i> light of foot as a wild roe.
c31491	And Asahel pursued after Abner;
c31493	and in going he turned not to the right hand nor to the left
c31494	from following Abner.
c31495	Then Abner looked behind
c31496	him, and said,
c31497	<i>Art</i> thou
c31498	Asahel?
c31499	And he answered,
c31500	I <i>am.</i>
c31501	And Abner said
c31502	to him, Turn thee aside to thy right hand or to thy left,
c31503	and lay thee hold on one of the young men,
c31504	and take thee his armour.
c31505	But Asahel would not
c31506	turn aside from following of him.
c31507	And Abner said again
c31508	to Asahel,
c31509	Turn thee aside from following
c31510	me: wherefore should I smite thee to the ground?
c31511	how then should I hold up my face to Joab thy brother?
c31512	Howbeit he refused
c31513	to turn aside:
c31514	wherefore Abner with the hinder end of the spear smote him under the fifth
c31515	<i>rib,</i> that the spear came out behind
c31516	him; and he fell down there,
c31517	and died in the same place:
c31518	and it came to pass,
c31519	<i>that</i> as many
c31520	as came to the place
c31521	where Asahel fell down
c31522	and died
c31523	stood still.
c31524	Joab also and Abishai pursued after Abner:
c31525	and the sun went down
c31526	when they were come to the hill of Ammah,
c31527	that <i>lieth</i> before Giah by the way of the wilderness of Gibeon.
c31528	And the children of Benjamin gathered themselves together after Abner,
c31529	and became one troop,
c31530	and stood on the top of an hill.
c31531	Then Abner called to Joab,
c31532	and said,
c31533	Shall the sword devour for ever?
c31534	knowest thou not
c31535	that it will be bitterness in the latter end?
c31536	how long shall it be then, ere thou bid the people
c31537	return from following their brethren?
c31538	And Joab said,
c31539	<i>As</i> God liveth,
c31540	unless thou hadst spoken,
c31541	surely then in the morning the people had gone up every one from following
c31542	his brother.
c31543	So Joab blew a trumpet,
c31544	and all the people stood
c31545	still, and pursued after Israel no more,
c31546	neither fought they any more.
c31548	And Abner and his men walked all that night through the plain,
c31549	and passed over Jordan,
c31550	and went through all Bithron,
c31551	and they came to Mahanaim.
c31552	And Joab returned from following Abner:
c31553	and when he had gathered all the people together,
c31554	there lacked of David's servants nineteen men and Asahel.
c31555	But the servants of David had smitten of Benjamin, and of Abner's men,
c31556	<i>so that</i> three hundred and threescore men died.
c31557	And they took up Asahel,
c31558	and buried him in the sepulchre of his father,
c31559	which <i>was in</i> Bethlehem.
c31560	And Joab and his men went all night,
c31561	and they came to Hebron at break of day.
c31562	Now there was long war between the house of Saul and the house of David:
c31563	but David waxed stronger and stronger,
c31565	and the house of Saul waxed
c31566	weaker and weaker.
c31567	And unto David were sons born in Hebron:
c31568	and his firstborn was Amnon, of Ahinoam the Jezreelitess;
c31569	And his second, Chileab, of Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite;
c31570	and the third, Absalom the son of Maacah the daughter of Talmai king of Geshur;
c31571	And the fourth, Adonijah the son of Haggith;
c31572	and the fifth, Shephatiah the son of Abital;
c31573	And the sixth, Ithream, by Eglah David's wife.
c31574	These were born to David in Hebron.
c31575	And it came to pass,
c31576	while there was war between the house of Saul and the house of David,
c31577	that Abner made himself strong for the house of Saul.
c31578	And Saul had a concubine,
c31579	whose name <i>was</i> Rizpah, the daughter of Aiah:
c31580	and <i>Ishbosheth</i> said to Abner,
c31581	Wherefore hast thou gone in unto my father's concubine?
c31582	Then was Abner very wroth for the words of Ishbosheth,
c31583	and said,
c31584	<i>Am</i> I a dog's head,
c31585	which against Judah
c31586	do shew kindness this day unto the house of Saul thy father, to his brethren, and to his friends,
c31587	and have not delivered thee into the hand of David,
c31588	that thou chargest me to day with a fault concerning this woman?
c31589	So do God to Abner,
c31590	and more also,
c31591	except,
c31592	as the LORD hath sworn to David,
c31593	even so I do to him;
c31594	To translate the kingdom from the house of Saul,
c31595	and to set up the throne of David over Israel and over Judah, from Dan even to Beersheba.
c31596	And he could not answer Abner a word again,
c31598	because he feared him.
c31599	And Abner sent messengers to David on his behalf,
c31600	saying,
c31601	Whose <i>is</i> the land?
c31602	saying
c31603	<i>also,</i> Make thy league with
c31604	me, and, behold, my hand <i>shall be</i> with
c31605	thee, to bring about all Israel unto thee.
c31606	And he said,
c31607	Well;
c31608	I will make a league with
c31609	thee: but one thing I require of
c31610	thee, that is,
c31611	Thou shalt not see my face,
c31612	except thou first bring Michal Saul's daughter,
c31613	when thou comest
c31614	to see my face.
c31615	And David sent messengers to Ishbosheth Saul's son,
c31616	saying,
c31617	Deliver <i>me</i> my wife Michal,
c31618	which I espoused to me for an hundred foreskins of the Philistines.
c31619	And Ishbosheth sent,
c31620	and took her from <i>her</i> husband, <i>even</i> from Phaltiel the son of Laish.
c31621	And her husband went with her along weeping behind her to Bahurim.
c31622	Then said Abner unto
c31623	him, Go,
c31624	return.
c31625	And he returned.
c31626	And Abner had communication with the elders of Israel,
c31627	saying,
c31628	Ye sought for David in times past <i>to be</i> king over you:
c31629	Now
c31630	then do
c31631	<i>it:</i> for the LORD hath spoken of David,
c31632	saying,
c31633	By the hand of my servant David I will save my people Israel out of the hand of the Philistines, and out of the hand of all their enemies.
c31634	And Abner also spake in the ears of Benjamin:
c31635	and Abner went also
c31636	to speak in the ears of David in Hebron all
c31637	that seemed good to Israel, and that seemed good to the whole house of Benjamin.
c31638	So Abner came to David to Hebron,
c31639	and twenty men with
c31640	him. And David made Abner and the men
c31641	that <i>were</i> with
c31642	him a feast.
c31643	And Abner said unto David,
c31644	I will arise
c31645	and go,
c31646	and will gather all Israel unto my lord the king,
c31647	that they may make a league with
c31648	thee, and that thou mayest reign over all
c31649	that thine heart desireth.
c31650	And David sent Abner
c31651	away; and he went in peace.
c31652	And, behold, the servants of David and Joab came from <i>pursuing</i> a troop,
c31653	and brought in a great spoil with
c31654	them: but Abner
c31655	<i>was</i> not with David in Hebron;
c31656	for he had sent him away,
c31657	and he was gone in peace.
c31658	When Joab and all the host
c31659	that <i>was</i> with
c31660	him were come,
c31661	they told Joab,
c31662	saying,
c31663	Abner the son of Ner came to the king,
c31664	and he hath sent him away,
c31665	and he is gone in peace.
c31666	Then Joab came to the king,
c31667	and said,
c31668	What hast thou done?
c31669	behold, Abner came unto
c31670	thee; why <i>is</i> it <i>that</i> thou hast sent him away,
c31671	and he is quite gone?
c31672	Thou knowest Abner the son of Ner,
c31673	that
c31674	to deceive
c31675	he came
c31676	thee, and to know thy going out and thy coming in,
c31677	and to know all
c31678	that thou doest.
c31679	And when Joab was come out from David,
c31680	he sent messengers after Abner,
c31681	which brought him again from the well of Sirah:
c31682	but David knew <i>it</i> not.
c31683	And when Abner was returned to Hebron,
c31684	Joab took him aside in the gate
c31685	to speak with him quietly,
c31686	and smote him there under the fifth
c31687	<i>rib,</i> that he died, for the blood of Asahel his brother.
c31688	And afterward when David heard
c31689	<i>it,</i> he said,
c31690	I and my kingdom <i>are</i> guiltless before the LORD for ever from the blood of Abner the son of Ner:
c31691	Let it rest on the head of Joab, and on all his father's house;
c31692	and let there not fail from the house of Joab one that hath an issue, or that is a leper,
c31693	or that leaneth on a staff,
c31694	or that falleth on the sword,
c31695	or that lacketh bread.
c31696	So Joab and Abishai his brother slew Abner,
c31697	because he had slain their brother Asahel at Gibeon in the battle.
c31698	And David said to Joab, and to all the people
c31699	that <i>were</i> with
c31700	him, Rend your clothes,
c31701	and gird you with sackcloth,
c31702	and mourn before Abner.
c31703	And king David <i>himself</i> followed the bier.
c31704	And they buried Abner in Hebron:
c31705	and the king lifted up his voice,
c31706	and wept at the grave of Abner;
c31707	and all the people wept.
c31708	And the king lamented over Abner,
c31709	and said,
c31710	Died Abner as a fool dieth?
c31711	Thy hands <i>were</i> not bound,
c31712	nor thy feet put into fetters:
c31713	as a man falleth before wicked men,
c31714	<i>so</i> fellest
c31715	thou. And all the people wept again
c31716	over him.
c31717	And when all the people came
c31718	to cause David to eat meat while it was yet day,
c31719	David sware,
c31720	saying,
c31721	So do God
c31722	to me, and more also,
c31723	if
c31724	till the sun be down.
c31725	I taste bread, or ought else,
c31726	And all the people took notice
c31727	<i>of it,</i> and it pleased them:
c31728	as whatsoever
c31729	the king did
c31730	pleased all the people.
c31731	For all the people and all Israel understood that day
c31732	that it was not of the king
c31733	to slay Abner the son of Ner.
c31734	And the king said unto his servants,
c31735	Know ye not
c31736	that there is a prince and a great man fallen this day in Israel?
c31737	And I <i>am</i> this day weak,
c31738	though anointed king;
c31739	and these men the sons of Zeruiah <i>be</i> too hard for
c31740	me: the LORD shall reward the doer of evil according to his wickedness.
c31741	And when Saul's son heard
c31742	that Abner was dead in Hebron,
c31743	his hands were feeble,
c31744	and all the Israelites were troubled.
c31745	And Saul's son had two men <i>that were</i> captains of bands:
c31746	the name of the one <i>was</i> Baanah,
c31747	and the name of the other Rechab,
c31748	the sons of Rimmon a Beerothite, of the children of Benjamin:
c31749	(for Beeroth also was reckoned to Benjamin:
c31750	And the Beerothites fled to Gittaim,
c31751	and were sojourners there until this day.)
c31752	And Jonathan, Saul's son, had a son <i>that was</i> lame of <i>his</i> feet.
c31753	He was five years old
c31754	when the tidings came of Saul and Jonathan out of Jezreel,
c31755	and his nurse took him up,
c31756	and fled:
c31757	and it came to pass,
c31758	as she made haste
c31759	to flee,
c31760	that he fell,
c31761	and became lame.
c31762	And his name <i>was</i> Mephibosheth.
c31763	And the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, Rechab and Baanah, went,
c31764	and came
c31765	about the heat of the day
c31766	to the house of Ishbosheth,
c31767	who lay on a bed at noon.
c31768	And they came thither into the midst of the house, <i>as though</i> they would have fetched wheat;
c31769	and they smote him under the fifth
c31770	<i>rib:</i> and Rechab and Baanah his brother escaped.
c31771	For when they came into the house,
c31772	he lay on his bed in his bedchamber,
c31773	and they smote
c31774	him, and slew
c31775	him, and beheaded
c31776	him, and took his head,
c31777	and gat them away through the plain all night.
c31778	And they brought the head of Ishbosheth unto David to Hebron,
c31779	and said to the king,
c31780	Behold the head of Ishbosheth the son of Saul thine enemy,
c31781	which sought thy life;
c31782	and the LORD hath avenged my lord the king this day of Saul, and of his seed.
c31783	And David answered Rechab and Baanah his brother, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite,
c31784	and said
c31785	unto them, <i>As</i> the LORD liveth,
c31786	who hath redeemed my soul out of all adversity,
c31787	When
c31788	one told
c31789	me, saying,
c31790	Behold, Saul is dead,
c31791	thinking to have brought good tidings,
c31792	I took hold
c31793	of him, and slew him in Ziklag,
c31794	who <i>thought</i> that I would have given him a reward for his tidings:
c31795	How much more, when wicked men have slain a righteous person in his own house upon his bed?
c31797	shall I not therefore now require his blood of your hand,
c31798	and take you away from the earth?
c31799	And David commanded his young men,
c31800	and they slew
c31801	them, and cut off their hands and their feet,
c31802	and hanged <i>them</i> up over the pool in Hebron.
c31803	But they took the head of Ishbosheth,
c31804	and buried <i>it</i> in the sepulchre of Abner in Hebron.
c31805	Then came all the tribes of Israel to David unto Hebron,
c31806	and spake,
c31807	saying,
c31808	Behold,
c31809	we <i>are</i> thy bone and thy flesh.
c31810	Also in time past,
c31811	when Saul was king over
c31812	us, thou wast
c31813	he that leddest out
c31814	and broughtest in Israel:
c31815	and the LORD said
c31816	to thee, Thou shalt feed my people Israel,
c31817	and thou shalt be a captain over Israel.
c31818	So all the elders of Israel came to the king to Hebron;
c31819	and king David made a league with them in Hebron before the LORD:
c31820	and they anointed David king over Israel.
c31821	David <i>was</i> thirty years old
c31822	when he began to reign,
c31823	<i>and</i> he reigned forty years.
c31824	In Hebron he reigned over Judah seven years and six months:
c31825	and in Jerusalem he reigned thirty and three years over all Israel and Judah.
c31826	And the king and his men went to Jerusalem unto the Jebusites, the inhabitants of the land:
c31827	which spake unto David,
c31828	saying,
c31829	thou shalt not come in hither:
c31830	Except thou take away the blind and the lame,
c31831	thinking,
c31832	David cannot come in hither.
c31833	Nevertheless David took the strong hold of Zion:
c31834	the same <i>is</i> the city of David.
c31835	And David said on that day,
c31836	Whosoever
c31837	and smiteth the Jebusites,
c31838	getteth up to the gutter,
c31839	and the lame and the blind, <i>that are</i> hated of David's soul,
c31840	<i>he shall be chief and captain.</i> Wherefore they said,
c31841	The blind and the lame shall not come into the house.
c31842	So David dwelt in the fort,
c31843	and called it the city of David.
c31844	And David built round about from Millo and inward.
c31845	And David went on, and grew great,
c31846	and the LORD God of hosts <i>was</i> with him.
c31847	And Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and cedar trees, and carpenters, and masons:
c31848	and they built David an house.
c31849	And David perceived
c31850	that the LORD had established him king over Israel,
c31851	and that he had exalted his kingdom for his people Israel's sake.
c31852	And David took <i>him</i> more concubines and wives out of Jerusalem,
c31853	after he was come from Hebron:
c31854	and there were yet sons and daughters born to David.
c31855	And these <i>be</i> the names
c31856	of those that were born unto him in Jerusalem;
c31857	Shammua, and Shobab, and Nathan, and Solomon,
c31858	Ibhar also, and Elishua, and Nepheg, and Japhia,
c31859	And Elishama, and Eliada, and Eliphalet.
c31860	But when the Philistines heard
c31861	that they had anointed David king over Israel,
c31862	all the Philistines came up
c31863	to seek David;
c31864	and David heard
c31865	<i>of it,</i> and went down to the hold.
c31866	The Philistines also came
c31867	and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim.
c31868	And David enquired of the LORD,
c31869	saying,
c31870	Shall I go up to the Philistines?
c31871	wilt thou deliver them into mine hand?
c31872	And the LORD said unto David,
c31873	Go up:
c31874	for I will doubtless deliver the Philistines into thine hand.
c31875	And David came to Baalperazim,
c31876	and David smote them there,
c31877	and said,
c31878	The LORD hath broken forth upon mine enemies before me, as the breach of waters.
c31879	Therefore he called the name of that place Baalperazim.
c31880	And there they left their images,
c31881	and David and his men burned them.
c31882	And the Philistines came up yet again,
c31884	and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim.
c31885	And when David enquired of the LORD,
c31886	he said,
c31887	Thou shalt not go up;
c31888	<i>but</i> fetch a compass behind
c31889	them, and come upon them over against the mulberry trees.
c31890	And let it be,
c31891	when thou hearest the sound of a going in the tops of the mulberry trees,
c31892	that then thou shalt bestir
c31893	thyself: for then shall the LORD go out before
c31894	thee, to smite the host of the Philistines.
c31895	And David did so,
c31896	as the LORD had commanded
c31897	him; and smote the Philistines from Geba
c31898	until thou come to Gazer.
c31899	Again, David gathered together all <i>the</i> chosen <i>men</i> of Israel, thirty thousand.
c31901	And David arose, and went with all the people
c31902	that <i>were</i> with
c31903	him from Baale of Judah,
c31904	to bring up from thence the ark of God,
c31905	whose name is called by the name of the LORD of hosts
c31906	that dwelleth <i>between</i> the cherubims.
c31908	And they set the ark of God upon a new cart,
c31909	and brought it out of the house of Abinadab
c31910	that <i>was</i> in Gibeah:
c31911	and Uzzah and Ahio, the sons of Abinadab, drave the new cart.
c31912	And they brought it out of the house of Abinadab
c31913	which <i>was</i> at Gibeah,
c31914	accompanying the ark of God:
c31915	and Ahio went before the ark.
c31916	And David and all the house of Israel played before the LORD on all manner of <i>instruments made of</i> fir wood, even on harps, and on psalteries, and on timbrels, and on cornets, and on cymbals.
c31917	And when they came to Nachon's threshingfloor,
c31918	Uzzah put forth <i>his hand</i> to the ark of God,
c31919	and took hold
c31920	of it; for the oxen shook <i>it.</i>
c31921	And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Uzzah;
c31922	and God smote him there for <i>his</i> error;
c31923	and there he died by the ark of God.
c31924	And David was displeased,
c31925	because the LORD had made a breach upon Uzzah:
c31926	and he called the name of the place Perezuzzah to this day.
c31927	And David was afraid of the LORD that day,
c31928	and said,
c31929	How shall the ark of the LORD come to me?
c31930	So David would not
c31931	remove the ark of the LORD unto him into the city of David:
c31932	but David carried it aside into the house of Obededom the Gittite.
c31933	And the ark of the LORD continued in the house of Obededom the Gittite three months:
c31934	and the LORD blessed Obededom, and all his household.
c31935	And it was told king David,
c31936	saying,
c31937	The LORD hath blessed the house of Obededom, and all
c31938	that
c31939	<i>pertaineth</i> unto him, because of the ark of God.
c31940	So David went
c31941	and brought up the ark of God from the house of Obededom into the city of David with gladness.
c31942	And it was
c31943	<i>so,</i> that when they that bare the ark of the LORD had gone six paces,
c31944	he sacrificed oxen and fatlings.
c31945	And David danced before the LORD with all <i>his</i> might;
c31946	and David <i>was</i> girded with a linen ephod.
c31947	So David and all the house of Israel brought up the ark of the LORD with shouting, and with the sound of the trumpet.
c31948	And as
c31949	the ark of the LORD came into the city of David,
c31950	Michal Saul's daughter looked through a window,
c31951	and saw king David
c31952	leaping
c31953	and dancing before the LORD;
c31954	and she despised him in her heart.
c31955	And they brought in the ark of the LORD,
c31956	and set it in his place, in the midst of the tabernacle
c31957	that David had pitched
c31958	for it: and David offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before the LORD.
c31959	And as soon as David had made an end
c31960	of offering burnt offerings and peace offerings,
c31961	he blessed the people in the name of the LORD of hosts.
c31962	And he dealt among all the people, <i>even</i> among the whole multitude of Israel, as well to the women as men, to every one a cake of bread, and a good piece <i>of flesh,</i> and a flagon
c31963	<i>of wine.</i> So all the people departed every one to his house.
c31964	Then David returned
c31965	to bless his household.
c31966	And Michal the daughter of Saul came out
c31967	to meet David,
c31968	and said,
c31969	How glorious was the king of Israel to day,
c31970	who uncovered himself to day in the eyes of the handmaids of his servants,
c31971	as one of the vain fellows shamelessly uncovereth himself!
c31972	And David said unto Michal,
c31973	<i>It was</i> before the LORD,
c31974	which chose me before thy father, and before all his house,
c31975	to appoint me ruler over the people of the LORD, over Israel:
c31976	therefore will I play before the LORD.
c31977	And I will yet be more vile than thus,
c31978	and will be base in mine own sight:
c31979	and of the maidservants
c31980	which thou hast spoken
c31981	of, of them shall I be had in honour.
c31982	Therefore Michal the daughter of Saul
c31983	had no child unto the day of her death.
c31984	And it came to pass,
c31985	when the king sat in his house,
c31986	and the LORD had given him rest round about from all his enemies;
c31987	That the king said unto Nathan the prophet,
c31988	See now,
c31989	I dwell in an house of cedar,
c31990	but the ark of God dwelleth within curtains.
c31991	And Nathan said to the king,
c31992	all
c31993	that <i>is</i> in thine heart;
c31994	Go,
c31995	do
c31996	for the LORD <i>is</i> with thee.
c31997	And it came to pass that night,
c31998	that the word of the LORD came unto Nathan,
c31999	saying,
c32000	Go
c32001	and tell my servant David,
c32002	Thus saith the LORD,
c32003	Shalt thou build me an house
c32004	for me to dwell in?
c32005	Whereas I have not dwelt in <i>any</i> house since the time
c32006	that I brought up the children of Israel out of Egypt,
c32007	even to this day,
c32008	but have walked in a tent and in a tabernacle.
c32009	In all
c32010	<i>the places</i> wherein I have walked with all the children of Israel
c32011	spake I a word with any of the tribes of Israel,
c32012	whom I commanded
c32013	to feed my people Israel,
c32014	saying,
c32015	Why build ye not me an house of cedar?
c32016	Now
c32017	therefore so shalt thou say unto my servant David,
c32018	Thus saith the LORD of hosts,
c32019	I took thee from the sheepcote, from following the sheep,
c32020	to be ruler over my people, over Israel:
c32021	And I was with thee whithersoever
c32022	thou wentest,
c32023	and have cut off all thine enemies out of thy sight,
c32024	and have made thee a great name, like unto the name of the great
c32025	<i>men</i> that <i>are</i> in the earth.
c32026	Moreover I will appoint a place for my people Israel,
c32027	and will plant
c32028	them, that they may dwell in a place
c32029	of their own, and move no more;
c32030	neither shall the children of wickedness afflict them any more,
c32032	as beforetime,
c32033	And as since the time
c32034	that I commanded judges <i>to be</i> over my people Israel,
c32035	and have caused thee to rest from all thine enemies.
c32036	Also the LORD telleth
c32037	thee that he will make thee an house.
c32038	And when thy days be fulfilled,
c32039	and thou shalt sleep with thy fathers,
c32040	I will set up thy seed after
c32041	thee, which shall proceed out of thy bowels,
c32042	and I will establish his kingdom.
c32043	He shall build an house for my name,
c32044	and I will stablish the throne of his kingdom for ever.
c32045	I will be his father,
c32046	and he shall be my son.
c32047	If he commit iniquity,
c32048	I will chasten him with the rod of men, and with the stripes of the children of men:
c32049	But my mercy shall not depart away from
c32050	him, as I took <i>it</i> from Saul,
c32051	whom I put away before thee.
c32052	And thine house and thy kingdom shall be established for ever before
c32053	thee: thy throne shall be established for ever.
c32054	According to all these words, and according to all this vision,
c32055	so did Nathan speak unto David.
c32056	Then went king David
c32057	in, and sat before the LORD,
c32058	and he said,
c32059	Who <i>am</i> I,
c32060	O Lord GOD?
c32061	and what <i>is</i> my house,
c32062	that thou hast brought me hitherto?
c32063	And this was yet a small thing in thy sight,
c32064	O Lord GOD;
c32065	but thou hast spoken also of thy servant's house for a great while to come.
c32066	And <i>is</i> this the manner of man,
c32067	O Lord GOD?
c32068	And what can David say more
c32069	unto
c32070	thee? for thou, Lord GOD, knowest thy servant.
c32072	For thy word's sake, and according to thine own heart, hast thou done all these great things,
c32073	to make thy servant know <i>them.</i>
c32074	Wherefore thou art great,
c32075	O LORD God:
c32076	for <i>there is</i> none like thee,
c32077	neither <i>is there any</i> God beside thee, according to all
c32078	that we have heard with our ears.
c32079	And what one nation in the earth <i>is</i> like thy people, <i>even</i> like Israel,
c32080	whom God went
c32081	to redeem for a people
c32082	to himself, and to make him a name,
c32083	and to do for you great things and terrible, for thy land, before thy people,
c32084	which thou redeemedst to thee from Egypt, <i>from</i> the nations and their gods?
c32085	For thou hast confirmed to thyself thy people Israel <i>to be</i> a people unto thee for ever:
c32086	and thou,
c32087	LORD,
c32088	art become their God.
c32089	And now,
c32090	O LORD God,
c32091	the word
c32092	that thou hast spoken concerning thy servant, and concerning his house,
c32093	establish <i>it</i> for ever,
c32094	and do
c32095	as thou hast said.
c32096	And let thy name be magnified for ever,
c32097	saying,
c32098	The LORD of hosts <i>is</i> the God over Israel:
c32099	and let the house of thy servant David be established before thee.
c32100	For thou,
c32101	O LORD of hosts, God of Israel,
c32102	hast revealed to thy servant,
c32103	saying,
c32104	I will build thee an house:
c32105	therefore hath thy servant found in his heart
c32106	to pray this prayer unto thee.
c32107	And now,
c32108	O Lord GOD,
c32109	thou <i>art</i> that God,
c32110	and thy words be true,
c32111	and thou hast promised this goodness unto thy servant:
c32112	Therefore now let it please
c32113	thee to bless the house of thy servant,
c32114	that it may continue for ever before
c32115	thee: for thou,
c32116	O Lord GOD,
c32117	hast spoken
c32118	<i>it:</i> and with thy blessing let the house of thy servant be blessed for ever.
c32119	And after this it came to pass,
c32120	that David smote the Philistines,
c32121	and subdued
c32122	them: and David took Methegammah out of the hand of the Philistines.
c32123	And he smote Moab,
c32124	and measured them with a line,
c32125	casting them down to the ground;
c32126	even with two lines measured
c32127	he to put to death,
c32128	and with one full line
c32129	to keep alive.
c32130	And <i>so</i> the Moabites became David's servants, <i>and</i> brought gifts.
c32131	David smote also Hadadezer, the son of Rehob, king of Zobah,
c32132	as he went
c32133	to recover his border at the river Euphrates.
c32134	And David took from him a thousand <i>chariots,</i> and seven hundred horsemen, and twenty thousand footmen:
c32135	and David houghed all the chariot
c32136	<i>horses,</i> but reserved of them <i>for</i> an hundred chariots.
c32137	And when the Syrians of Damascus came
c32138	to succour Hadadezer king of Zobah,
c32139	David slew of the Syrians two and twenty thousand men.
c32140	Then David put garrisons in Syria of Damascus:
c32141	and the Syrians became servants to David, <i>and</i> brought gifts.
c32142	And the LORD preserved David whithersoever
c32143	he went.
c32144	And David took the shields of gold
c32145	that were on the servants of Hadadezer,
c32146	and brought them to Jerusalem.
c32147	And from Betah, and from Berothai, cities of Hadadezer, king David took exceeding much brass.
c32148	When Toi king of Hamath heard
c32149	that David had smitten all the host of Hadadezer,
c32150	Then Toi sent Joram his son unto king David,
c32151	to salute
c32152	him, and to bless
c32153	him, because he had fought against Hadadezer,
c32154	and smitten
c32155	him: for Hadadezer had wars with Toi.
c32156	And <i>Joram</i> brought with him vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and vessels of brass:
c32157	Which also king David did dedicate unto the LORD, with the silver and gold
c32158	that he had dedicated of all nations
c32159	which he subdued;
c32160	Of Syria, and of Moab, and of the children of Ammon, and of the Philistines, and of Amalek, and of the spoil of Hadadezer, son of Rehob, king of Zobah.
c32161	And David gat <i>him</i> a name
c32162	when he returned
c32163	from smiting of the Syrians in the valley of salt, <i>being</i> eighteen thousand <i>men.</i>
c32164	And he put garrisons in Edom;
c32165	throughout all Edom put he garrisons,
c32166	and all they of Edom became David's servants.
c32167	And the LORD preserved David whithersoever
c32168	he went.
c32169	And David reigned over all Israel;
c32170	and David executed judgment and justice unto all his people.
c32171	And Joab the son of Zeruiah <i>was</i> over the host;
c32172	and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud <i>was</i> recorder;
c32173	And Zadok the son of Ahitub, and Ahimelech the son of Abiathar, <i>were</i> the priests;
c32174	and Seraiah <i>was</i> the scribe;
c32175	And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada
c32176	<i>was over</i> both the Cherethites and the Pelethites;
c32177	and David's sons were chief rulers.
c32178	And David said,
c32180	Is there yet
c32181	any that is left of the house of Saul,
c32182	that I may shew him kindness for Jonathan's sake?
c32183	And <i>there was</i> of the house of Saul a servant
c32184	whose name <i>was</i> Ziba.
c32185	And when they had called him unto David,
c32186	the king said unto
c32187	him, <i>Art</i> thou Ziba?
c32188	And he said,
c32189	Thy servant <i>is he.</i>
c32190	And the king said,
c32191	<i>Is</i> there not yet any of the house of Saul,
c32192	that I may shew the kindness of God unto
c32193	him? And Ziba said unto the king,
c32194	Jonathan hath yet a son,
c32195	<i>which is</i> lame on <i>his</i> feet.
c32196	And the king said
c32197	unto him, Where <i>is</i> he?
c32198	And Ziba said unto the king,
c32199	Behold, he <i>is</i> in the house of Machir, the son of Ammiel, in Lodebar.
c32200	Then king David sent,
c32201	and fetched him out of the house of Machir, the son of Ammiel, from Lodebar.
c32202	Now when Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan, the son of Saul, was come unto David,
c32203	he fell on his face,
c32204	and did reverence.
c32205	And David said,
c32206	Mephibosheth.
c32207	And he answered,
c32208	Behold thy servant!
c32209	And David said
c32210	unto him, Fear not:
c32211	for I will surely shew thee kindness for Jonathan thy father's sake,
c32212	and will restore thee all the land of Saul thy father;
c32213	and thou shalt eat bread at my table continually.
c32214	And he bowed himself,
c32215	and said,
c32216	What <i>is</i> thy servant,
c32217	that thou shouldest look upon such a dead dog
c32218	as I <i>am?</i>
c32219	Then the king called to Ziba, Saul's servant,
c32220	and said unto
c32221	all
c32222	that pertained to Saul and to all his house.
c32223	him, I have given unto thy master's son
c32224	Thou therefore, and thy sons, and thy servants, shall till the land
c32225	for him, and thou shalt bring
c32226	in <i>the fruits,</i> that thy master's son may have food
c32227	to eat:
c32228	but Mephibosheth thy master's son shall eat bread alway at my table.
c32229	Now Ziba had fifteen sons and twenty servants.
c32230	Then said Ziba unto the king,
c32231	According to all
c32232	that my lord the king hath commanded his servant,
c32233	so shall thy servant do.
c32234	As for Mephibosheth, <i>said the king,</i> he shall eat at my table, as one of the king's sons.
c32235	And Mephibosheth had a young son,
c32236	whose name <i>was</i> Micha.
c32237	And all that dwelt in the house of Ziba <i>were</i> servants unto Mephibosheth.
c32238	So Mephibosheth dwelt in Jerusalem:
c32239	for he did eat continually at the king's table;
c32240	and was lame on both his feet.
c32241	And it came to pass after this,
c32242	that the king of the children of Ammon died,
c32243	and Hanun his son reigned in his stead.
c32244	Then said David,
c32245	I will shew kindness unto Hanun the son of Nahash,
c32246	as his father shewed kindness unto
c32247	me. And David sent
c32248	to comfort him by the hand of his servants for his father.
c32249	And David's servants came into the land of the children of Ammon.
c32250	And the princes of the children of Ammon said unto Hanun their lord,
c32251	Thinkest thou that David doth honour thy father,
c32252	that he hath sent comforters
c32253	unto thee? hath not
c32254	thee, to search the city,
c32255	and to spy it out,
c32256	and to overthrow it?
c32257	David <i>rather</i> sent his servants unto
c32258	Wherefore Hanun took David's servants,
c32259	and shaved off the one half of their beards,
c32260	and cut off their garments in the middle, <i>even</i> to their buttocks,
c32261	and sent them away.
c32262	When they told <i>it</i> unto David,
c32263	he sent
c32264	to meet
c32265	them, because the men were greatly ashamed:
c32266	and the king said,
c32267	Tarry at Jericho
c32268	until your beards be grown,
c32269	and <i>then</i> return.
c32270	And when the children of Ammon saw
c32271	that they stank before David,
c32272	the children of Ammon sent
c32273	and hired the Syrians of Bethrehob, and the Syrians of Zoba, twenty thousand footmen,
c32274	and of king Maacah a thousand men,
c32275	and of Ishtob twelve thousand men.
c32276	And when David heard
c32277	of <i>it,</i> he sent Joab, and all the host of the mighty men.
c32278	And the children of Ammon came out,
c32279	and put the battle in array at the entering in of the gate:
c32280	and the Syrians of Zoba, and of Rehob, and Ishtob, and Maacah, <i>were</i> by themselves in the field.
c32281	When Joab saw
c32282	that the front of the battle was against him before and behind,
c32283	he chose of all the choice <i>men</i> of Israel,
c32284	and put <i>them</i> in array
c32285	against the Syrians:
c32286	And the rest of the people he delivered into the hand of Abishai his brother,
c32287	that he might put <i>them</i> in array
c32288	against the children of Ammon.
c32289	And he said,
c32290	If the Syrians be too strong for
c32291	me, then thou shalt help
c32292	me: but if the children of Ammon be too strong for
c32293	thee, then I will come and help thee.
c32295	Be of good courage,
c32296	and let us play the men for our people, and for the cities of our God:
c32297	and the LORD do
c32298	that which seemeth him good.
c32299	And Joab drew nigh, and the people
c32300	that <i>were</i> with
c32301	him, unto the battle against the Syrians:
c32302	and they fled before him.
c32303	And when the children of Ammon saw
c32304	that the Syrians were fled,
c32305	then fled they also before Abishai,
c32306	and entered into the city.
c32307	So Joab returned from the children of Ammon,
c32308	and came to Jerusalem.
c32309	And when the Syrians saw
c32310	that they were smitten before Israel,
c32311	they gathered themselves together.
c32312	And Hadarezer sent,
c32313	and brought out the Syrians
c32314	that <i>were</i> beyond the river:
c32315	and they came to Helam;
c32316	and Shobach the captain of the host of Hadarezer <i>went</i> before them.
c32317	And when it was told David,
c32318	he gathered all Israel together,
c32319	and passed over Jordan,
c32320	and came to Helam.
c32321	And the Syrians set themselves in array
c32322	against David,
c32323	and fought with him.
c32324	And the Syrians fled before Israel;
c32325	and David slew <i>the men of</i> seven hundred chariots of the Syrians, and forty thousand horsemen,
c32326	and smote Shobach the captain of their host,
c32327	who died there.
c32328	And when all the kings <i>that were</i> servants to Hadarezer saw
c32329	that they were smitten before Israel,
c32330	they made peace with Israel,
c32331	and served
c32332	them. So the Syrians feared
c32333	to help the children of Ammon any more.
c32334	And it came to pass, after the year was expired, at the time
c32335	when kings go forth
c32336	<i>to battle,</i> that David sent Joab, and his servants with him, and all Israel;
c32337	and they destroyed the children of Ammon,
c32338	and besieged Rabbah.
c32339	But David tarried still at Jerusalem.
c32340	And it came to pass in an eveningtide,
c32341	that David arose from off his bed,
c32342	and walked upon the roof of the king's house:
c32343	and from the roof he saw a woman washing
c32344	herself; and the woman <i>was</i> very beautiful to look upon.
c32345	And David sent
c32346	and enquired after the woman.
c32347	And <i>one</i> said,
c32348	<i>Is</i> not this Bathsheba, the daughter of Eliam, the wife of Uriah the Hittite?
c32349	And David sent messengers,
c32350	and took
c32351	her; and she came in unto
c32352	him, and he lay with her;
c32353	for she was purified from her uncleanness:
c32354	and she returned unto her house.
c32355	And the woman conceived,
c32356	and sent
c32357	and told David,
c32358	and said,
c32359	I <i>am</i> with child.
c32360	And David sent to Joab,
c32361	<i>saying,</i> Send me Uriah the Hittite.
c32362	And Joab sent Uriah to David.
c32363	And when Uriah was come unto
c32364	him, David demanded <i>of him</i> how Joab did, and how the people did, and how the war prospered.
c32365	And David said to Uriah,
c32366	Go down to thy house,
c32367	and wash thy feet.
c32368	And Uriah departed out of the king's house,
c32369	and there followed him a mess <i>of meat</i> from the king.
c32370	But Uriah slept at the door of the king's house with all the servants of his lord,
c32371	and went not down to his house.
c32372	And when they had told David,
c32373	saying,
c32374	Uriah went not down unto his house,
c32375	David said unto Uriah,
c32376	Camest thou not from <i>thy</i> journey?
c32377	why <i>then</i> didst thou not go down unto thine house?
c32378	And Uriah said unto David,
c32379	The ark, and Israel, and Judah, abide in tents;
c32380	and my lord Joab, and the servants of my lord, are encamped in the open fields;
c32381	shall I then go into mine house,
c32382	to eat
c32383	and to drink,
c32384	and to lie with my wife?
c32385	<i>as</i> thou livest, and <i>as</i> thy soul liveth,
c32386	I will not do this thing.
c32387	And David said to Uriah,
c32388	Tarry here to day also,
c32389	and to morrow I will let thee depart.
c32390	So Uriah abode in Jerusalem that day, and the morrow.
c32391	And when David had called
c32392	him, he did eat and drink before
c32394	him; and he made him drunk:
c32395	and at even he went out
c32396	to lie on his bed with the servants of his lord,
c32397	but went not down to his house.
c32398	And it came to pass in the morning,
c32399	that David wrote a letter to Joab,
c32400	and sent <i>it</i> by the hand of Uriah.
c32401	And he wrote in the letter,
c32402	saying,
c32403	Set ye Uriah in the forefront of the hottest battle,
c32404	and retire ye from
c32405	him, that he may be smitten,
c32406	and die.
c32407	And it came to pass,
c32408	when Joab observed the city,
c32409	that he assigned Uriah unto a place
c32410	where he knew
c32411	that valiant men <i>were.</i>
c32412	And the men of the city went out,
c32413	and fought with Joab:
c32414	and there fell <i>some</i> of the people of the servants of David;
c32415	and Uriah the Hittite died also.
c32416	Then Joab sent
c32417	and told David all the things concerning the war;
c32418	And charged the messenger,
c32419	saying,
c32420	When thou hast made an end of telling the matters of the war
c32421	unto the king,
c32423	And if so be that the king's wrath arise,
c32424	and he say
c32425	unto thee, Wherefore approached ye so nigh unto the city
c32426	when ye did fight?
c32427	knew ye not
c32428	that they would shoot from the wall?
c32429	Who smote Abimelech the son of Jerubbesheth?
c32430	did not a woman cast a piece of a millstone upon him from the wall,
c32431	that he died in Thebez?
c32432	why went ye nigh the wall?
c32433	then say
c32434	thou, Thy servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also.
c32435	So the messenger went,
c32436	and came
c32437	and shewed David all
c32438	that Joab had sent him for.
c32439	And the messenger said unto David,
c32440	Surely the men prevailed against
c32441	us, and came out unto us into the field,
c32442	and we were upon them even unto the entering of the gate.
c32443	And the shooters shot from off the wall upon thy servants;
c32444	and <i>some</i> of the king's servants be dead,
c32445	and thy servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also.
c32446	Then David said unto the messenger,
c32447	Thus shalt thou say unto Joab,
c32448	Let not this thing displease
c32449	thee, for the sword devoureth one as well as another:
c32450	make thy battle more strong against the city,
c32451	and overthrow
c32452	it: and encourage thou him.
c32453	And when the wife of Uriah heard
c32454	that Uriah her husband was dead,
c32455	she mourned for her husband.
c32456	And when the mourning was past,
c32457	David sent
c32458	and fetched her to his house,
c32459	and she became his wife,
c32460	and bare him a son.
c32461	But the thing
c32462	that David had done
c32463	displeased the LORD.
c32464	And the LORD sent Nathan unto David.
c32465	And he came unto
c32466	him, and said
c32467	unto him, There were two men in one city;
c32468	the one rich,
c32469	and the other poor.
c32470	The rich <i>man</i> had exceeding many flocks and herds:
c32471	But the poor <i>man</i> had nothing,
c32472	save one little ewe lamb,
c32473	which he had bought
c32474	and nourished up:
c32475	and it grew up together with him, and with his children;
c32476	it did eat of his own meat,
c32477	and drank of his own cup,
c32478	and lay in his bosom,
c32479	and was unto him as a daughter.
c32480	And there came a traveller unto the rich man,
c32481	and he spared
c32482	to take of his own flock and of his own herd,
c32483	to dress for the wayfaring man
c32484	that was come
c32485	unto him; but took the poor man's lamb,
c32486	and dressed it for the man
c32487	that was come to him.
c32488	And David's anger was greatly kindled against the man;
c32489	and he said to Nathan,
c32490	<i>As</i> the LORD liveth,
c32491	the man that hath done this <i>thing</i> shall surely die:
c32493	And he shall restore the lamb fourfold,
c32494	because he did this thing,
c32495	and because he had no pity.
c32496	And Nathan said to David,
c32497	Thou <i>art</i> the man.
c32498	Thus saith the LORD God of Israel,
c32499	I anointed thee king over Israel,
c32500	and I delivered thee out of the hand of Saul;
c32501	And I gave thee thy master's house, and thy master's wives into thy bosom,
c32502	and gave thee the house of Israel and of Judah;
c32503	and if <i>that had been</i> too little,
c32504	I would moreover have given unto thee such and such things.
c32505	Wherefore hast thou despised the commandment of the LORD,
c32506	to do
c32507	evil in his sight?
c32508	thou hast killed Uriah the Hittite with the sword,
c32509	and hast taken his wife <i>to be</i> thy wife,
c32510	and hast slain him with the sword of the children of Ammon.
c32511	Now
c32512	therefore the sword shall never depart from thine house;
c32513	because thou hast despised
c32514	me, and hast taken the wife of Uriah the Hittite
c32515	to be thy wife.
c32516	Thus saith the LORD,
c32517	Behold, I will raise up evil against thee out of thine own house,
c32518	and I will take thy wives before thine eyes,
c32519	and give <i>them</i> unto thy neighbour,
c32520	and he shall lie with thy wives in the sight of this sun.
c32521	For thou didst <i>it</i> secretly:
c32522	but I will do this thing before all Israel, and before the sun.
c32523	And David said unto Nathan,
c32524	I have sinned against the LORD.
c32525	And Nathan said unto David,
c32526	The LORD also hath put away thy sin;
c32527	thou shalt not die.
c32528	Howbeit, because by this deed thou hast given great occasion to the enemies of the LORD to blaspheme,
c32529	the child also
c32530	<i>that is</i> born
c32531	unto thee shall surely die.
c32532	And Nathan departed unto his house.
c32533	And the LORD struck the child
c32534	that Uriah's wife bare unto David,
c32535	and it was very sick.
c32536	David therefore besought God for the child;
c32537	and David fasted,
c32538	and went
c32540	in, and lay all night upon the earth.
c32541	And the elders of his house arose, <i>and went</i> to
c32542	him, to raise him up from the earth:
c32543	but he would not,
c32544	neither did he eat bread with them.
c32545	And it came to pass on the seventh day,
c32546	that the child died.
c32547	And the servants of David feared
c32548	to tell
c32549	him that the child was dead:
c32550	for they said,
c32551	Behold,
c32552	while the child was yet alive,
c32553	we spake unto
c32554	him, and he would not hearken unto our voice:
c32555	how will he then vex himself, if we tell
c32556	him that the child is dead?
c32558	But when David saw
c32559	that his servants whispered,
c32560	David perceived
c32561	that the child was dead:
c32562	therefore David said unto his servants,
c32563	Is the child dead?
c32564	And they said,
c32565	He is dead.
c32566	Then David arose from the earth,
c32567	and washed,
c32568	and anointed
c32569	<i>himself,</i> and changed his apparel,
c32570	and came into the house of the LORD,
c32571	and worshipped:
c32572	then he came to his own house;
c32573	and when he required,
c32574	they set bread
c32575	before him, and he did eat.
c32576	Then said his servants unto
c32577	him, What thing <i>is</i> this
c32578	that thou hast done?
c32579	for the child, <i>while</i> <i>it was</i> alive;
c32580	thou didst fast
c32581	and weep
c32582	but when the child was dead,
c32583	thou didst rise
c32584	and eat bread.
c32585	And he said,
c32586	While the child was yet alive,
c32587	I fasted
c32588	and wept:
c32589	for I said,
c32590	Who can tell
c32591	<i>whether</i> GOD will be gracious
c32592	to me, that the child may live?
c32593	But now he is dead,
c32594	wherefore should I fast?
c32595	can
c32596	I bring him back again?
c32597	I shall go to
c32598	him, but he shall not return to me.
c32599	And David comforted Bathsheba his wife,
c32600	and went in unto
c32601	her, and lay with
c32602	her: and she bare a son,
c32603	and he called his name Solomon:
c32604	and the LORD loved him.
c32605	And he sent by the hand of Nathan the prophet;
c32606	and he called his name Jedidiah, because of the LORD.
c32607	And Joab fought against Rabbah of the children of Ammon,
c32608	and took the royal city.
c32609	And Joab sent messengers to David,
c32610	and said,
c32611	I have fought against Rabbah,
c32612	and have taken the city of waters.
c32613	Now
c32614	therefore gather the rest of the people
c32615	together, and encamp against the city,
c32616	and take
c32617	it: lest I take the city,
c32618	and it be called after my name.
c32619	And David gathered all the people
c32620	together, and went to Rabbah,
c32621	and fought
c32622	against it, and took it.
c32623	And he took their king's crown from off his head,
c32624	the weight whereof <i>was</i> a talent of gold
c32625	with the precious stones:
c32626	and it was <i>set</i> on David's head.
c32627	And he brought forth the spoil of the city in great abundance.
c32628	the people
c32629	that
c32630	And he brought forth
c32631	<i>were</i> therein, and put <i>them</i> under saws, and under harrows of iron, and under axes of iron,
c32632	and made them pass through the brickkiln:
c32633	and thus did he unto all the cities of the children of Ammon.
c32634	So David and all the people returned unto Jerusalem.
c32635	And it came to pass after this,
c32636	that Absalom the son of David had a fair sister,
c32637	whose name <i>was</i> Tamar;
c32638	and Amnon the son of David loved her.
c32639	And Amnon was so vexed,
c32640	that he fell sick
c32641	for his sister Tamar;
c32642	for she <i>was</i> a virgin;
c32643	and Amnon thought it hard
c32644	for him to do any thing to her.
c32645	But Amnon had a friend,
c32646	whose name <i>was</i> Jonadab, the son of Shimeah David's brother:
c32647	and Jonadab <i>was</i> a very subtil man.
c32648	And he said
c32649	unto him, Why <i>art</i> thou, <i>being</i> the king's son, lean
c32651	from day to day?
c32652	wilt thou not tell
c32653	me? And Amnon said
c32654	unto him, I love Tamar, my brother Absalom's sister.
c32655	And Jonadab said
c32656	unto him, Lay thee down on thy bed,
c32657	and make thyself sick:
c32658	and when thy father cometh
c32659	to see
c32660	thee, say unto
c32661	him, I pray thee, let my sister Tamar come,
c32662	and give me meat,
c32663	and dress the meat in my sight,
c32664	that I may see
c32665	<i>it,</i> and eat <i>it</i> at her hand.
c32666	So Amnon lay down,
c32667	and made himself sick:
c32668	and when the king was come
c32669	to see
c32670	him, Amnon said unto the king,
c32671	I pray thee, let Tamar my sister come,
c32672	and make me a couple of cakes in my sight,
c32673	that I may eat at her hand.
c32674	Then David sent home to Tamar,
c32675	saying,
c32676	Go now to thy brother Amnon's house,
c32677	and dress him meat.
c32678	So Tamar went to her brother Amnon's house;
c32679	and he was laid down.
c32680	And she took flour,
c32681	and kneaded
c32682	<i>it,</i> and made cakes in his sight,
c32683	and did bake the cakes.
c32684	And she took a pan,
c32685	and poured <i>them</i> out before
c32686	him; but he refused
c32687	to eat.
c32688	And Amnon said,
c32689	Have out all men from
c32690	me. And they went out every man from him.
c32691	And Amnon said unto Tamar,
c32692	Bring the meat into the chamber,
c32693	that I may eat of thine hand.
c32694	And Tamar took the cakes
c32695	which she had made,
c32696	and brought <i>them</i> into the chamber to Amnon her brother.
c32697	And when she had brought <i>them</i> unto
c32698	him to eat,
c32699	he took hold
c32700	of her, and said
c32701	unto her, Come
c32702	lie with
c32703	me, my sister.
c32704	And she answered
c32705	him, Nay,
c32706	my brother,
c32707	do not force
c32708	me; for no such thing ought to be done in Israel:
c32709	do not thou this folly.
c32710	And I,
c32711	whither shall I cause my shame to go?
c32712	and as for thee, thou shalt be as one of the fools in Israel.
c32713	Now
c32714	therefore, I pray thee, speak unto the king;
c32715	for he will not withhold me from thee.
c32716	Howbeit he would not
c32717	hearken unto her voice:
c32718	but, being stronger
c32719	than she, forced
c32720	her, and lay with her.
c32721	Then Amnon hated her exceedingly;
c32722	so that the hatred wherewith he hated her <i>was</i> greater
c32724	than the love
c32725	wherewith he had loved
c32726	her. And Amnon said
c32727	unto her, Arise,
c32728	be gone.
c32729	And she said
c32730	unto him, <i>There is</i> no
c32731	cause: this evil in sending me away <i>is</i> greater than the other
c32732	that thou didst unto
c32734	me. But he would not
c32735	hearken unto her.
c32736	Then he called his servant
c32737	that ministered
c32738	unto him, and said,
c32739	Put now this <i>woman</i> out from me,
c32740	and bolt the door after her.
c32741	And <i>she had</i> a garment of divers colours upon
c32742	her: for with such robes were the king's daughters <i>that were</i> virgins apparelled.
c32743	Then his servant brought her out,
c32744	and bolted the door after her.
c32745	And Tamar put ashes on her head,
c32746	her garment of divers colours
c32747	that <i>was</i> on
c32748	and rent
c32749	her, and laid her hand on her head,
c32750	and went on
c32751	crying.
c32752	And Absalom her brother said unto
c32753	her, Hath Amnon thy brother been with
c32754	now
c32755	thy peace, my sister:
c32756	thee? but hold
c32757	he <i>is</i> thy brother;
c32758	regard not this thing.
c32759	So Tamar remained
c32760	desolate in her brother Absalom's house.
c32761	But when king David heard of all these things,
c32762	he was very wroth.
c32763	And Absalom spake unto his brother Amnon neither good nor bad:
c32764	for Absalom hated Amnon, because
c32765	he had forced his sister Tamar.
c32766	And it came to pass after two full years,
c32767	that Absalom had sheepshearers in Baalhazor,
c32768	which <i>is</i> beside Ephraim:
c32769	and Absalom invited all the king's sons.
c32770	And Absalom came to the king,
c32771	and said,
c32772	Behold now, thy servant hath sheepshearers;
c32773	let the king, I beseech thee, and his servants go with thy servant.
c32774	And the king said to Absalom,
c32775	Nay,
c32776	my son,
c32777	let us not all now go,
c32778	lest we be chargeable unto
c32779	thee. And he pressed
c32780	him: howbeit he would not
c32781	go,
c32782	but blessed him.
c32783	Then said Absalom,
c32784	If not,
c32785	I pray thee, let my brother Amnon go with
c32786	us. And the king said
c32787	unto him, Why should he go with thee?
c32788	But Absalom pressed
c32789	him, that he let Amnon and all the king's sons go with him.
c32790	Now Absalom had commanded his servants,
c32791	saying,
c32792	Mark ye now
c32793	when Amnon's heart is merry with wine,
c32794	and when I say unto
c32795	you, Smite Amnon;
c32796	then kill
c32797	him, fear not:
c32798	have not
c32799	I commanded
c32800	you? be courageous,
c32801	and be valiant.
c32802	And the servants of Absalom did unto Amnon
c32803	as Absalom had commanded.
c32804	Then all the king's sons arose,
c32806	and every man gat him up upon his mule,
c32807	and fled.
c32808	And it came to pass,
c32809	while they were in the way,
c32810	that tidings came to David,
c32811	saying,
c32812	Absalom hath slain all the king's sons,
c32813	and there is not one of them left.
c32814	Then the king arose,
c32815	and tare his garments,
c32816	and lay on the earth;
c32817	and all his servants stood by
c32818	with their clothes rent.
c32819	And Jonadab, the son of Shimeah David's brother, answered
c32820	and said,
c32821	Let not my lord suppose
c32822	<i>that</i> they have slain all the young men the king's sons;
c32823	for Amnon only is dead:
c32824	for by the appointment of Absalom this hath been determined from the day
c32825	that he forced his sister Tamar.
c32826	Now
c32827	therefore let not my lord the king take the thing to his heart,
c32828	to think
c32829	that all the king's sons are dead:
c32830	for Amnon only is dead.
c32831	But Absalom fled.
c32832	And the young man that kept the watch lifted up
c32834	his eyes,
c32835	and looked,
c32836	and, behold, there came much people by the way of the hill side behind him.
c32837	And Jonadab said unto the king,
c32838	Behold, the king's sons come:
c32839	as thy servant said,
c32840	so it is.
c32841	And it came to pass,
c32842	as soon as he had made an end
c32843	of speaking,
c32844	that, behold, the king's sons came,
c32845	and lifted up their voice
c32846	and wept:
c32847	and the king also and all his servants wept very sore.
c32848	But Absalom fled,
c32849	and went to Talmai, the son of Ammihud, king of Geshur.
c32850	And <i>David</i> mourned for his son every day.
c32851	So Absalom fled,
c32852	and went to Geshur,
c32853	and was there three years.
c32854	And <i>the soul of</i> king David longed
c32855	to go forth unto Absalom:
c32856	for he was comforted concerning Amnon,
c32857	seeing he was dead.
c32858	Now Joab the son of Zeruiah perceived
c32859	that the king's heart <i>was</i> toward Absalom.
c32860	And Joab sent to Tekoah,
c32861	and fetched thence a wise woman,
c32862	and said unto
c32863	her, I pray thee, feign thyself to be a mourner,
c32864	and put on now mourning apparel,
c32865	and anoint not thyself with oil,
c32866	but be as a woman
c32867	that had a long time mourned for the dead:
c32868	And come to the king,
c32869	and speak on this manner unto him.
c32870	So Joab put the words in her mouth.
c32871	And when the woman of Tekoah spake to the king,
c32872	she fell on her face to the ground,
c32873	and did obeisance,
c32874	and said,
c32875	Help,
c32876	O king.
c32877	And the king said
c32878	unto her, What
c32879	aileth thee? And she answered,
c32880	I <i>am</i> indeed a widow woman,
c32881	and mine husband is dead.
c32882	And thy handmaid had two sons,
c32883	and they two strove together in the field,
c32884	and <i>there was</i> none to part
c32886	them, but the one smote the other,
c32887	and slew him.
c32888	And, behold, the whole family is risen against thine handmaid,
c32889	and they said,
c32890	Deliver him that smote his brother,
c32891	that we may kill him, for the life of his brother
c32892	whom he slew;
c32893	and we will destroy the heir also:
c32894	and so they shall quench my coal
c32895	which is left,
c32896	and shall not leave to my husband <i>neither</i> name nor remainder upon the earth.
c32897	And the king said unto the woman,
c32898	Go to thine house,
c32899	and I will give charge concerning thee.
c32900	And the woman of Tekoah said unto the king,
c32901	<i>be</i> on
c32902	My lord, O king,
c32903	the iniquity
c32904	me, and on my father's house:
c32905	and the king and his throne <i>be</i> guiltless.
c32906	And the king said,
c32907	Whosoever saith <i>ought</i> unto
c32908	thee, bring him to
c32909	me, and he shall not touch thee any more.
c32911	Then said
c32912	she, I pray thee, let the king remember the LORD thy God, that thou wouldest not suffer the revengers of blood to destroy any more, lest they destroy my son.
c32915	And he said,
c32916	<i>As</i> the LORD liveth,
c32917	there shall not one hair of thy son fall to the earth.
c32918	Then the woman said,
c32919	Let thine handmaid, I pray thee, speak <i>one</i> word unto my lord the king.
c32920	And he said,
c32921	Say on.
c32922	And the woman said,
c32923	Wherefore then hast thou thought such a thing against the people of God?
c32924	for the king doth speak this thing as one which is faulty,
c32925	in that the king doth not fetch home again his banished.
c32926	For we must needs die,
c32927	and <i>are</i> as water
c32928	spilt on the ground,
c32929	which cannot be gathered up
c32930	again; neither doth God respect <i>any</i> person:
c32931	yet doth he devise means,
c32932	that his banished be not expelled from him.
c32933	Now
c32934	therefore that I am come
c32935	to speak of this thing unto my lord the king,
c32936	<i>it is</i> because the people have made me afraid:
c32937	and thy handmaid said,
c32938	I will now speak unto the king;
c32939	it may be that the king will perform the request of his handmaid.
c32940	For the king will hear,
c32941	to deliver his handmaid out of the hand of the man
c32942	<i>that would</i> destroy me and my son together out of the inheritance of God.
c32943	Then thine handmaid said,
c32944	The word of my lord the king shall now be comfortable:
c32945	for as an angel of God,
c32946	so <i>is</i> my lord the king
c32947	to discern good and bad:
c32948	therefore the LORD thy God will be with thee.
c32949	Then the king answered
c32950	and said unto the woman,
c32951	Hide not from me, I pray thee, the thing
c32952	that I shall ask
c32953	thee. And the woman said,
c32954	Let my lord the king now speak.
c32955	And the king said,
c32956	<i>Is not</i> the hand of Joab with thee in all this?
c32957	And the woman answered
c32958	and said,
c32959	<i>As</i> thy soul liveth,
c32960	my lord the king,
c32961	none can turn
c32962	to the right
c32963	hand or to the left from ought
c32964	that my lord the king hath spoken:
c32965	for thy servant Joab,
c32966	he bade
c32967	me, and he put all these words in the mouth of thine handmaid:
c32968	To fetch about this form of speech
c32969	hath thy servant Joab done this thing:
c32970	and my lord <i>is</i> wise, according to the wisdom of an angel of God,
c32971	to know all
c32972	<i>things</i> that <i>are</i> in the earth.
c32973	And the king said unto Joab,
c32974	Behold now, I have done this thing:
c32975	go
c32976	therefore, bring the young man Absalom again.
c32977	And Joab fell to the ground on his face,
c32978	and bowed himself,
c32979	and thanked the king:
c32980	and Joab said,
c32981	To day thy servant knoweth
c32982	that I have found grace in thy sight,
c32983	my lord, O king,
c32984	in that the king hath fulfilled the request of his servant.
c32985	So Joab arose
c32986	and went to Geshur,
c32987	and brought Absalom to Jerusalem.
c32988	And the king said,
c32989	Let him turn to his own house,
c32990	and let him not see my face.
c32991	So Absalom returned to his own house,
c32992	and saw not the king's face.
c32993	But in all Israel there was none to be so much praised as Absalom for his beauty:
c32995	from the sole of his foot even to the crown of his head there was no blemish in him.
c32996	And when he polled his head,
c32997	(for it was at every year's end
c32998	that he polled
c32999	<i>it:</i> because <i>the hair</i> was heavy on
c33000	him, therefore he polled
c33001	it:) he weighed the hair of his head at two hundred shekels after the king's weight.
c33002	And unto Absalom there were born three sons, and one daughter,
c33003	whose name <i>was</i> Tamar:
c33004	she was a woman of a fair countenance.
c33005	So Absalom dwelt two full years in Jerusalem,
c33006	and saw not the king's face.
c33007	Therefore Absalom sent for Joab,
c33008	to have sent him to the king;
c33009	but he would not
c33010	come to
c33011	him: and when he sent again the second time,
c33012	he would not
c33013	come.
c33014	Therefore he said unto his servants,
c33015	See,
c33016	Joab's field is near mine,
c33017	and he hath barley there;
c33018	go
c33019	and set it on fire.
c33020	And Absalom's servants set the field on fire.
c33021	Then Joab arose,
c33022	and came to Absalom unto <i>his</i> house,
c33023	and said unto
c33024	him, Wherefore have thy servants set my field
c33026	on fire?
c33027	And Absalom answered Joab,
c33028	Behold, I sent unto
c33029	thee, saying,
c33030	Come hither,
c33031	that I may send thee to the king,
c33032	to say,
c33033	Wherefore am I come from Geshur?
c33034	<i>it had been</i> good
c33035	for me <i>to have been</i> there still:
c33036	now
c33037	therefore let me see the king's face;
c33038	and if there be <i>any</i> iniquity
c33039	in me, let him kill me.
c33040	So Joab came to the king,
c33041	and told
c33042	him: and when he had called for Absalom,
c33043	he came to the king,
c33044	and bowed himself on his face to the ground before the king:
c33045	and the king kissed Absalom.
c33046	And it came to pass after this,
c33047	that Absalom prepared him chariots and horses,
c33048	and fifty men to run before him.
c33049	And Absalom rose up early,
c33050	and stood beside the way of the gate:
c33051	and it was
c33052	<i>so,</i> that when any man
c33053	that had a controversy
c33054	came to the king for judgment,
c33055	then Absalom called unto
c33056	him, and said,
c33057	Of what city <i>art</i> thou?
c33058	And he said,
c33059	Thy servant <i>is</i> of one of the tribes of Israel.
c33060	And Absalom said unto
c33061	him, See,
c33062	thy matters <i>are</i> good and right;
c33063	but <i>there is</i> no man <i>deputed</i> of the king to hear thee.
c33064	Absalom said
c33065	moreover, Oh that I were made judge in the land,
c33066	that every man which hath any suit or cause might come unto
c33068	me, and I would do him justice!
c33069	And it was
c33070	<i>so,</i> that when any man came nigh
c33071	<i>to him</i> to do him obeisance,
c33072	he put forth his hand,
c33073	and took
c33074	him, and kissed him.
c33075	And on this manner did Absalom to all Israel
c33076	that came to the king for judgment:
c33077	so Absalom stole the hearts of the men of Israel.
c33078	And it came to pass after forty years,
c33079	that Absalom said unto the king,
c33080	I pray thee, let me go
c33081	and pay my vow,
c33082	which I have vowed unto the LORD,
c33083	in Hebron.
c33084	For thy servant vowed a vow
c33085	while I abode at Geshur in Syria,
c33086	saying,
c33087	If the LORD shall bring me again indeed to Jerusalem,
c33088	then I will serve the LORD.
c33089	And the king said
c33090	unto him, Go in peace.
c33091	So he arose,
c33092	and went to Hebron.
c33093	But Absalom sent spies throughout all the tribes of Israel,
c33094	saying,
c33095	As soon as ye hear the sound of the trumpet,
c33096	then ye shall say,
c33097	Absalom reigneth in Hebron.
c33098	And with Absalom went two hundred men out of Jerusalem,
c33099	<i>that were</i> called;
c33100	and they went in their simplicity,
c33101	and they knew not any thing.
c33102	And Absalom sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite, David's counsellor, from his city, <i>even</i> from Giloh,
c33103	while he offered sacrifices.
c33104	And the conspiracy was strong;
c33105	for the people increased continually
c33106	with Absalom.
c33107	And there came a messenger to David,
c33108	saying,
c33109	The hearts of the men of Israel are after Absalom.
c33110	And David said unto all his servants
c33111	that <i>were</i> with him at Jerusalem,
c33112	Arise,
c33113	and let us flee;
c33114	for we shall not <i>else</i> escape from Absalom:
c33115	make speed
c33116	to depart,
c33117	lest he overtake us suddenly,
c33119	and bring evil upon
c33120	us, and smite the city with the edge of the sword.
c33121	And the king's servants said unto the king,
c33123	<i>are ready to do</i> whatsoever my lord the king shall appoint.
c33124	Behold, thy servants
c33125	And the king went forth, and all his household after
c33126	him. And the king left ten women, <i>which were</i> concubines,
c33127	to keep the house.
c33128	And the king went forth, and all the people after
c33129	him, and tarried in a place that was far off.
c33130	And all his servants passed on beside
c33131	him; and all the Cherethites, and all the Pelethites, and all the Gittites, six hundred men
c33132	which came after him from Gath,
c33133	passed on before the king.
c33134	Then said the king to Ittai the Gittite,
c33135	Wherefore goest thou also with
c33136	us? return
c33138	for thou <i>art</i> a stranger, and also an exile.
c33139	to thy place, and abide with the king:
c33140	Whereas thou camest <i>but</i> yesterday,
c33141	should I this day make thee go up and down with
c33143	us? seeing I go
c33144	whither I may,
c33145	return
c33146	thou, and take back thy brethren:
c33147	mercy and truth <i>be</i> with thee.
c33148	And Ittai answered the king,
c33149	and said,
c33150	<i>As</i> the LORD liveth,
c33151	and <i>as</i> my lord the king liveth,
c33152	surely in what place
c33153	my lord the king shall be, whether in death
c33155	or life,
c33156	even there also will thy servant be.
c33157	And David said to Ittai,
c33158	Go
c33159	and pass over.
c33160	And Ittai the Gittite passed over, and all his men, and all the little ones
c33161	that <i>were</i> with him.
c33162	And all the country wept with a loud voice,
c33163	and all the people passed over:
c33164	the king also himself passed over the brook Kidron,
c33165	and all the people passed over, toward the way of the wilderness.
c33166	And lo
c33167	Zadok also, and all the Levites <i>were</i> with
c33168	him, bearing the ark of the covenant of God:
c33169	and they set down the ark of God;
c33170	and Abiathar went up,
c33171	until all the people had done
c33172	passing out of the city.
c33173	And the king said unto Zadok,
c33174	Carry back the ark of God into the city:
c33175	if I shall find favour in the eyes of the LORD,
c33176	he will bring me again,
c33177	and shew me <i>both</i> it, and his habitation:
c33178	But if he thus say,
c33179	I have no delight
c33180	in thee; behold,
c33181	<i>here am</i> I, let him do
c33182	to me as seemeth good unto him.
c33183	The king said also unto Zadok the priest,
c33184	<i>Art not</i> thou a seer?
c33185	return into the city in peace,
c33186	and your two sons with you, Ahimaaz thy son, and Jonathan the son of Abiathar.
c33187	See,
c33188	I will tarry in the plain of the wilderness,
c33189	until there come word from
c33190	you to certify me.
c33191	Zadok therefore and Abiathar carried the ark of God again to Jerusalem:
c33192	and they tarried there.
c33193	And David went up by the ascent of <i>mount</i> Olivet, and wept as he went up,
c33194	and had his head covered,
c33195	and he went barefoot:
c33196	and all the people
c33197	that <i>was</i> with
c33198	him covered every man his head,
c33199	and they went up, weeping as they went up.
c33200	And <i>one</i> told David,
c33201	saying,
c33202	Ahithophel <i>is</i> among the conspirators with Absalom.
c33203	And David said,
c33204	I pray thee, turn the counsel of Ahithophel into foolishness.
c33205	O LORD,
c33206	And it came to pass,
c33207	that <i>when</i> David was come to the top
c33208	<i>of the mount,</i> where he worshipped God,
c33209	behold,
c33210	came to meet
c33211	Hushai the Archite
c33212	him with his coat rent,
c33213	and earth upon his head:
c33214	Unto whom David said,
c33215	If thou passest on with
c33216	me, then thou shalt be a burden unto me:
c33217	But if thou return to the city,
c33218	and say unto Absalom,
c33219	I will be thy servant,
c33220	O king;
c33222	<i>as</i> I <i>have been</i> thy father's servant hitherto,
c33224	so <i>will</i> I now also <i>be</i> thy servant:
c33225	then mayest thou for me defeat the counsel of Ahithophel.
c33226	And <i>hast thou</i> not there with thee Zadok and Abiathar the priests?
c33227	therefore it shall be,
c33228	<i>that</i> what thing
c33229	soever thou shalt hear out of the king's house,
c33230	thou shalt tell <i>it</i> to Zadok and Abiathar the priests.
c33231	Behold, <i>they have</i> there with them their two sons,
c33232	Ahimaaz Zadok's
c33233	<i>son,</i> and Jonathan Abiathar's
c33234	<i>son;</i> and by them ye shall send unto me every thing
c33235	that ye can hear.
c33236	So Hushai David's friend came into the city,
c33237	and Absalom came into Jerusalem.
c33238	And when David was a little past the top
c33239	<i>of the hill,</i> behold, Ziba the servant of Mephibosheth
c33240	met
c33241	him, with a couple of asses saddled,
c33242	and upon them two hundred <i>loaves</i> of bread, and an hundred bunches of raisins, and an hundred of summer fruits, and a bottle of wine.
c33243	And the king said unto Ziba,
c33244	What meanest thou by these?
c33245	And Ziba said,
c33246	The asses <i>be</i> for the king's household
c33247	to ride on;
c33248	and the bread and summer fruit
c33249	for the young men to eat;
c33250	and the wine,
c33251	that such as be faint in the wilderness may drink.
c33252	And the king said,
c33253	And where <i>is</i> thy master's son?
c33254	And Ziba said unto the king,
c33255	Behold, he abideth at Jerusalem:
c33256	for he said,
c33257	To day shall the house of Israel restore me the kingdom of my father.
c33258	Then said the king to Ziba,
c33259	Behold, thine <i>are</i> all
c33260	that <i>pertained</i> unto Mephibosheth.
c33261	And Ziba said,
c33262	I humbly beseech
c33263	thee <i>that</i> I may find grace in thy sight,
c33264	my lord, O king.
c33265	And when king David came to Bahurim,
c33266	behold, thence came out a man of the family of the house of Saul,
c33267	whose name <i>was</i> Shimei, the son of Gera:
c33268	he came forth, and cursed still as he came.
c33270	And he cast stones at David, and at all the servants of king David:
c33271	and all the people and all the mighty men <i>were</i> on his right hand and on his left.
c33272	And thus said Shimei
c33273	when he cursed,
c33274	Come out,
c33275	come out,
c33276	thou bloody man, and thou man of Belial:
c33277	The LORD hath returned upon thee all the blood of the house of Saul,
c33278	in whose stead thou hast reigned;
c33279	and the LORD hath delivered the kingdom into the hand of Absalom thy son:
c33280	and, behold, thou <i>art taken</i> in thy mischief,
c33281	because thou <i>art</i> a bloody man.
c33282	Then said Abishai the son of Zeruiah unto the king,
c33283	Why should this dead dog curse my lord the king?
c33284	let me go over, I pray thee,
c33285	and take off his head.
c33286	And the king said,
c33287	What
c33288	have I to do with you, ye sons of Zeruiah?
c33290	so let him curse, because the LORD hath said
c33291	unto him, Curse David.
c33292	Who shall then say,
c33293	Wherefore hast thou done so?
c33294	And David said to Abishai, and to all his servants,
c33295	Behold, my son,
c33296	which came forth of my bowels,
c33297	seeketh my life:
c33298	how much more now <i>may this</i> Benjamite
c33299	<i>do it?</i> let him alone,
c33300	and let him curse;
c33301	for the LORD hath bidden him.
c33302	It may be that the LORD will look on mine affliction,
c33303	and that the LORD will requite me good for his cursing this day.
c33304	And as David and his men went by the way,
c33305	Shimei went along on the hill's side over against
c33306	as he went,
c33307	him, and cursed
c33308	and threw stones at
c33309	him, and cast dust.
c33310	And the king, and all the people that <i>were</i> with him, came
c33312	weary,
c33313	and refreshed themselves there.
c33314	And Absalom, and all the people the men of Israel, came to Jerusalem,
c33315	and Ahithophel with him.
c33316	And it came to pass,
c33317	when Hushai the Archite, David's friend, was come unto Absalom,
c33318	that Hushai said unto Absalom,
c33319	God save the king,
c33320	God save the king.
c33321	And Absalom said to Hushai,
c33322	<i>Is</i> this thy kindness to thy friend? why wentest thou not with
c33323	thy friend?
c33324	And Hushai said unto Absalom,
c33325	Nay;
c33326	but
c33327	whom the LORD, and this people, and all the men of Israel, choose,
c33328	his will I be,
c33329	and with him will I abide.
c33330	And again,
c33331	whom should I serve?
c33332	<i>should I</i> not <i>serve</i> in the presence of his son?
c33333	as I have served in thy father's presence,
c33334	so will I be in thy presence.
c33335	Then said Absalom to Ahithophel,
c33336	Give counsel
c33337	among you what we shall do.
c33338	And Ahithophel said unto Absalom,
c33339	Go in unto thy father's concubines,
c33340	which he hath left
c33341	to keep the house;
c33342	and all Israel shall hear
c33343	that thou art abhorred of thy father:
c33344	then shall the hands of all that <i>are</i> with thee be strong.
c33346	So they spread Absalom a tent upon the top
c33347	of the house; and Absalom went in unto his father's concubines in the sight of all Israel.
c33348	And the counsel of Ahithophel,
c33349	which he counselled in those days,
c33350	<i>was</i> as if a man had enquired at the oracle of God:
c33351	so <i>was</i> all the counsel of Ahithophel both with David and with Absalom.
c33352	Moreover Ahithophel said unto Absalom,
c33353	Let me now choose out twelve thousand men,
c33354	and I will arise
c33355	and pursue after David this night:
c33356	And I will come upon
c33357	him while he <i>is</i> weary and weak handed,
c33358	and will make him afraid:
c33359	and all the people that <i>are</i> with him shall flee;
c33361	and I will smite the king only:
c33362	And I will bring back all the people unto
c33363	<i>is</i> as if all returned:
c33364	thee: the man
c33365	whom thou seekest
c33366	<i>so</i> all the people shall be in peace.
c33367	And the saying pleased Absalom well, and all the elders of Israel.
c33368	Then said Absalom,
c33369	Call now Hushai the Archite also,
c33370	and let us hear
c33371	saith.
c33372	likewise what he
c33373	And when Hushai was come to Absalom,
c33374	Absalom spake unto
c33375	him, saying,
c33376	Ahithophel hath spoken after this manner:
c33377	shall we do <i>after</i> his saying?
c33378	if not;
c33379	speak thou.
c33380	And Hushai said unto Absalom,
c33381	The counsel that Ahithophel hath given <i>is</i> not good
c33382	at this time.
c33383	For, said Hushai,
c33384	thou knowest thy father and his men,
c33385	that they <i>be</i> mighty men,
c33386	and they <i>be</i> chafed in their minds, as a bear robbed of her whelps in the field:
c33387	and thy father <i>is</i> a man of war,
c33388	and will not lodge with the people.
c33389	Behold, he is hid now in some pit, or in some <i>other</i> place:
c33390	and it will come to pass,
c33391	when some of them be overthrown at the first,
c33392	that whosoever heareth
c33394	it will say,
c33395	There is a slaughter among the people
c33396	that follow Absalom.
c33397	And he
c33398	also <i>that is</i> valiant,
c33399	whose heart <i>is</i> as the heart of a lion,
c33400	shall utterly melt:
c33401	for all Israel knoweth
c33402	that thy father <i>is</i> a mighty man,
c33403	him <i>are</i> valiant men.
c33404	and <i>they</i> which <i>be</i> with
c33405	Therefore I counsel
c33406	that all Israel be generally gathered unto thee, from Dan even to Beersheba, as the sand
c33407	that <i>is</i> by the sea
c33408	for multitude;
c33409	and that thou go to battle in thine own person.
c33410	So shall we come upon him in some place
c33411	where he shall be found,
c33412	and we will light upon
c33413	him as the dew falleth on the ground:
c33414	and of him and of all the men that <i>are</i> with him there shall not be left
c33416	so much as one.
c33417	Moreover, if he be gotten into a city,
c33418	then shall all Israel bring ropes to that city,
c33419	and we will draw it into the river,
c33420	until there be not one small stone found there.
c33421	And Absalom and all the men of Israel said,
c33422	The counsel of Hushai the Archite <i>is</i> better than the counsel of Ahithophel.
c33423	For the LORD had appointed
c33424	to defeat the good counsel of Ahithophel,
c33425	to the intent that the LORD might bring evil upon Absalom.
c33426	Then said Hushai unto Zadok and to Abiathar the priests,
c33427	Thus and thus did Ahithophel counsel Absalom and the elders of Israel;
c33428	and thus and thus have I counselled.
c33429	Now
c33430	therefore send quickly,
c33431	and tell David,
c33432	saying,
c33433	Lodge not this night in the plains of the wilderness,
c33434	but speedily pass over;
c33435	lest the king be swallowed up, and all the people
c33436	that <i>are</i> with him.
c33437	Now Jonathan and Ahimaaz stayed by Enrogel;
c33438	and a wench went
c33439	and told
c33440	them; and they went
c33441	and told king David.
c33442	for they might not
c33443	be seen
c33444	to come into the city:
c33445	Nevertheless a lad saw
c33446	them, and told Absalom:
c33447	but they went both of them away quickly,
c33448	and came to a man's house in Bahurim,
c33449	which had a well in his court;
c33450	whither they went down.
c33451	And the woman took
c33452	and spread a covering over the well's mouth,
c33453	and spread ground corn thereon;
c33454	and the thing was not known.
c33455	And when Absalom's servants came to the woman to the house,
c33456	they said,
c33457	Where <i>is</i> Ahimaaz and Jonathan?
c33458	And the woman said
c33459	unto them, They be gone over the brook of water.
c33460	And when they had sought
c33461	and could not find
c33462	<i>them,</i> they returned to Jerusalem.
c33463	And it came to pass,
c33464	after they were departed,
c33465	that they came up out of the well,
c33466	and went
c33467	and told king David,
c33468	and said unto David,
c33469	Arise,
c33470	and pass quickly over the water:
c33471	for thus hath Ahithophel counselled against you.
c33472	Then David arose, and all the people
c33473	that <i>were</i> with
c33474	him, and they passed over Jordan:
c33475	by the morning light there lacked not one
c33476	of them that was not gone over Jordan.
c33477	And when Ahithophel saw
c33478	that his counsel was not followed,
c33479	he saddled <i>his</i> ass,
c33480	and arose,
c33481	and gat him home to his house, to his city,
c33482	and put his household
c33483	in order, and hanged himself,
c33484	and died,
c33485	and was buried in the sepulchre of his father.
c33486	Then David came to Mahanaim.
c33487	And Absalom passed over Jordan, he and all the men of Israel with him.
c33488	And Absalom made Amasa captain of the host instead of Joab:
c33489	which Amasa <i>was</i> a man's son,
c33490	whose name <i>was</i> Ithra an Israelite,
c33491	that went in to Abigail the daughter of Nahash, sister to Zeruiah Joab's mother.
c33492	So Israel and Absalom pitched in the land of Gilead.
c33493	And it came to pass,
c33494	when David was come to Mahanaim,
c33495	that Shobi the son of Nahash of Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and Machir the son of Ammiel of Lodebar, and Barzillai the Gileadite of Rogelim,
c33496	Brought beds, and basons, and earthen vessels, and wheat, and barley, and flour, and parched <i>corn,</i> and beans, and lentiles, and parched <i>pulse,</i>
c33497	And honey, and butter, and sheep, and cheese of kine, for David, and for the people
c33498	that <i>were</i> with
c33499	him, to eat:
c33500	for they said,
c33501	The people <i>is</i> hungry, and weary, and thirsty, in the wilderness.
c33502	And David numbered the people
c33503	that <i>were</i> with
c33504	him, and set captains of thousands and captains of hundreds over them.
c33505	And David sent forth a third part of the people
c33506	under the hand of Joab,
c33507	and a third part under the hand of Abishai the son of Zeruiah, Joab's brother,
c33508	and a third part under the hand of Ittai the Gittite.
c33509	And the king said unto the people,
c33510	I will surely go forth with you myself also.
c33511	But the people answered,
c33512	Thou shalt not go forth:
c33513	for if we flee away,
c33514	they will not care for
c33516	us; neither if half of us die, will they care for
c33517	us: but now <i>thou art</i> worth ten thousand
c33518	of us: therefore now <i>it is</i> better
c33519	that thou succour us out of the city.
c33521	And the king said unto
c33522	them, What seemeth you best
c33523	I will do.
c33524	And the king stood by the gate side,
c33525	and all the people came out by hundreds and by thousands.
c33526	And the king commanded Joab and Abishai and Ittai,
c33527	saying,
c33528	<i>Deal</i> gently for my sake with the young man, <i>even</i> with Absalom.
c33529	And all the people heard
c33530	when the king gave all the captains charge concerning Absalom.
c33531	So the people went out into the field
c33532	against Israel:
c33533	and the battle was in the wood of Ephraim;
c33534	Where the people of Israel were slain before the servants of David,
c33535	and there was there a great slaughter that day of twenty thousand <i>men.</i>
c33536	For the battle was there scattered over the face of all the country:
c33537	and the wood devoured more
c33538	people
c33539	that day than the sword devoured.
c33540	And Absalom met the servants of David.
c33541	And Absalom rode upon a mule,
c33542	and the mule went under the thick boughs of a great oak,
c33543	and his head caught hold of the oak,
c33544	and he was taken up between the heaven and the earth;
c33545	and the mule
c33546	that <i>was</i> under
c33547	him went away.
c33548	And a certain man saw
c33549	<i>it,</i> and told Joab,
c33550	and said,
c33551	Behold,
c33552	I saw Absalom
c33553	hanged in an oak.
c33554	And Joab said unto the man
c33555	that told
c33556	him, And, behold,
c33557	thou sawest
c33558	<i>him,</i> and why didst thou not smite him there to the ground?
c33560	and I would have given thee ten <i>shekels</i> of silver, and a girdle.
c33561	And the man said unto Joab,
c33562	Though I should receive a thousand <i>shekels</i> of silver in mine hand,
c33563	<i>yet</i> would I not put forth mine hand against the king's son:
c33564	for in our hearing the king charged thee and Abishai and Ittai,
c33565	saying,
c33566	Beware that none <i>touch</i> the young man Absalom.
c33567	Otherwise I should have wrought falsehood against mine own life:
c33568	for there is no matter hid from the king,
c33569	and thou thyself wouldest have set thyself against <i>me.</i>
c33570	Then said Joab,
c33571	I may not tarry thus with
c33572	thee. And he took three darts in his hand,
c33573	and thrust them through the heart of Absalom,
c33574	while he <i>was</i> yet alive in the midst of the oak.
c33575	And ten young men that bare Joab's armour compassed about
c33576	and smote Absalom,
c33577	and slew him.
c33578	And Joab blew the trumpet,
c33579	and the people returned
c33580	from pursuing after Israel:
c33581	for Joab held back the people.
c33582	And they took Absalom,
c33583	and cast him into a great pit in the wood,
c33584	and laid a very great heap of stones upon
c33585	him: and all Israel fled
c33586	every one to his tent.
c33587	Now Absalom in his lifetime had taken
c33588	and reared up for himself a pillar,
c33589	which <i>is</i> in the king's dale:
c33590	for he said,
c33591	I have no son
c33592	to keep my name in remembrance:
c33593	and he called the pillar after his own name:
c33594	and it is called unto this day, Absalom's place.
c33595	Then said Ahimaaz the son of Zadok,
c33596	Let me now run,
c33597	and bear the king
c33598	tidings, how that the LORD hath avenged him of his enemies.
c33599	And Joab said
c33600	unto him, Thou shalt not bear tidings this day,
c33601	but thou shalt bear tidings another day:
c33602	but this day thou shalt bear no tidings,
c33603	because the king's son is dead.
c33604	Then said Joab to Cushi,
c33605	Go
c33606	tell the king
c33607	what thou hast seen.
c33608	And Cushi bowed himself unto Joab,
c33609	and ran.
c33611	Then said Ahimaaz the son of Zadok yet again to Joab,
c33612	But howsoever,
c33613	let me, I pray thee, also run after Cushi.
c33614	And Joab said,
c33615	Wherefore wilt thou run,
c33616	my son,
c33617	seeing that thou hast no tidings ready?
c33618	But howsoever,
c33619	<i>said he,</i> let me run.
c33620	And he said
c33621	unto him, Run.
c33622	Then Ahimaaz ran by the way of the plain,
c33623	and overran Cushi.
c33624	And David sat between the two gates:
c33625	and the watchman went up to the roof over the gate unto the wall,
c33626	and lifted up his eyes,
c33627	and looked,
c33628	and behold a man running alone.
c33629	And the watchman cried,
c33630	and told the king.
c33631	And the king said,
c33632	If he <i>be</i> alone,
c33633	<i>there is</i> tidings in his mouth.
c33634	And he came apace, and drew near.
c33635	And the watchman saw another man
c33636	running:
c33637	and the watchman called unto the porter,
c33638	and said,
c33639	Behold <i>another</i> man running alone.
c33640	And the king said,
c33641	He also bringeth tidings.
c33642	And the watchman said,
c33643	Me thinketh the running of the foremost is like the running of Ahimaaz the son of Zadok.
c33644	And the king said,
c33645	He <i>is</i> a good man,
c33646	and cometh with good tidings.
c33647	And Ahimaaz called,
c33648	and said unto the king,
c33649	All is well.
c33650	And he fell down to the earth upon his face before the king,
c33651	and said,
c33652	Blessed <i>be</i> the LORD thy God,
c33653	which hath delivered up the men
c33654	that lifted up their hand against my lord the king.
c33655	And the king said,
c33656	Is the young man Absalom safe?
c33657	And Ahimaaz answered,
c33658	I saw a great tumult,
c33659	When Joab sent the king's servant, and <i>me</i> thy servant,
c33660	but I knew not what <i>it was.</i>
c33661	And the king said
c33662	<i>unto him,</i> Turn aside,
c33663	<i>and</i> stand here.
c33664	And he turned aside,
c33665	and stood still.
c33666	And, behold, Cushi came;
c33667	and Cushi said,
c33668	Tidings, my lord the king:
c33669	for the LORD hath avenged thee this day of all
c33670	them that rose up against thee.
c33671	And the king said unto Cushi,
c33672	Is the young man Absalom safe?
c33673	And Cushi answered,
c33674	The enemies of my lord the king, and all
c33676	that rise against thee to do <i>thee</i> hurt, be as <i>that</i> young man <i>is.</i>
c33677	And the king was much moved,
c33678	and went up to the chamber over the gate,
c33679	and wept:
c33680	thus he said,
c33681	and as he went,
c33682	O my son Absalom,
c33683	my son, my son Absalom!
c33684	would God
c33685	I had died for
c33686	thee, O Absalom, my son, my son!
c33687	And it was told Joab,
c33688	Behold, the king weepeth
c33689	and mourneth for Absalom.
c33690	And the victory that day was <i>turned</i> into mourning unto all the people: for the people heard
c33691	day
c33692	say that
c33693	how the king was grieved for his son.
c33694	And the people gat them by stealth that day
c33695	into the city,
c33696	as people being ashamed steal away
c33698	when they flee in battle.
c33699	But the king covered his face,
c33700	and the king cried with a loud voice,
c33701	O my son Absalom,
c33702	O Absalom, my son, my son!
c33703	And Joab came into the house to the king,
c33704	and said,
c33705	Thou hast shamed this day the faces of all thy servants,
c33706	which this day have saved thy life, and the lives of thy sons and of thy daughters, and the lives of thy wives, and the lives of thy concubines;
c33707	In that thou lovest thine enemies,
c33708	and hatest thy friends.
c33709	For thou hast declared this day,
c33710	that thou regardest neither princes nor servants:
c33711	for this day I perceive,
c33712	that
c33713	if Absalom had lived,
c33714	and all we had died this day,
c33715	then it had pleased thee well.
c33716	Now therefore arise,
c33717	go forth,
c33718	and speak comfortably unto thy servants:
c33719	for I swear by the LORD,
c33720	if thou go not forth,
c33721	there will not tarry one with thee this night:
c33722	and that will be worse unto thee than all the evil
c33723	that befell thee from thy youth until now.
c33724	Then the king arose,
c33725	and sat in the gate.
c33726	And they told unto all the people,
c33727	saying,
c33728	Behold, the king doth sit in the gate.
c33729	And all the people came before the king:
c33730	for Israel had fled
c33731	every man to his tent.
c33733	And all the people were at strife throughout all the tribes of Israel,
c33734	saying,
c33735	The king saved us out of the hand of our enemies,
c33736	and he delivered us out of the hand of the Philistines;
c33737	and now he is fled out of the land for Absalom.
c33738	And Absalom,
c33739	whom we anointed over
c33740	us, is dead in battle.
c33741	Now
c33742	therefore why speak ye
c33743	not a word of bringing the king back?
c33744	And king David sent to Zadok and to Abiathar the priests,
c33745	saying,
c33746	Speak unto the elders of Judah,
c33747	saying,
c33748	Why are ye the last
c33749	to bring the king back to his house?
c33750	seeing the speech of all Israel is come to the king, <i>even</i> to his house.
c33751	Ye <i>are</i> my brethren,
c33752	ye <i>are</i> my bones and my flesh:
c33753	wherefore then are ye the last
c33754	to bring back the king?
c33755	And say ye to Amasa,
c33756	<i>Art</i> thou not of my bone, and of my flesh?
c33757	God do so
c33758	to me, and more also,
c33759	if thou be not captain of the host before me continually in the room of Joab.
c33760	And he bowed the heart of all the men of Judah, even as <i>the heart of</i> one man;
c33761	so that they sent <i>this word</i> unto the king,
c33762	Return thou, and all thy servants.
c33763	So the king returned,
c33764	and came to Jordan.
c33765	And Judah came to Gilgal,
c33766	to go
c33767	to meet the king,
c33768	to conduct the king over Jordan.
c33769	And Shimei the son of Gera, a Benjamite, which <i>was</i> of Bahurim, hasted
c33771	and came down with the men of Judah
c33772	to meet king David.
c33773	And <i>there were</i> a thousand men of Benjamin with
c33774	him, and Ziba the servant of the house of Saul,
c33775	and his fifteen sons and his twenty servants with
c33776	him; and they went over Jordan before the king.
c33777	And there went over a ferry boat
c33778	to carry over the king's household,
c33779	and to do
c33780	what he thought good.
c33781	And Shimei the son of Gera fell down before the king,
c33782	as he was come over Jordan;
c33783	And said unto the king,
c33784	Let not my lord impute iniquity
c33785	unto me, neither do thou remember
c33786	that which thy servant did perversely the day
c33787	that my lord the king went out of Jerusalem,
c33788	that the king should take it to his heart.
c33789	For thy servant doth know
c33790	that I have sinned:
c33791	therefore, behold,
c33792	I am come the first this day of all the house of Joseph
c33793	to go down
c33794	to meet my lord the king.
c33795	But Abishai the son of Zeruiah answered
c33796	and said,
c33797	Shall not Shimei be put to death for this,
c33798	because he cursed the LORD'S anointed?
c33799	And David said,
c33800	What
c33801	have I to do with you, ye sons of Zeruiah,
c33802	that ye should this day be adversaries
c33803	unto me? shall there any man be put to death this day in Israel?
c33804	for do not I know
c33805	that I <i>am</i> this day king over Israel?
c33806	Therefore the king said unto Shimei,
c33807	Thou shalt not die.
c33808	And the king sware unto him.
c33809	And Mephibosheth the son of Saul came down
c33810	to meet the king,
c33811	and had neither dressed his feet,
c33812	nor trimmed his beard,
c33813	nor washed his clothes, from the day
c33814	the king departed
c33815	until the day
c33816	he came <i>again</i> in peace.
c33817	And it came to pass,
c33818	when he was come to Jerusalem
c33819	to meet the king,
c33820	that the king said
c33821	unto him, Wherefore wentest not thou with
c33822	me, Mephibosheth?
c33823	And he answered,
c33824	My lord, O king,
c33825	my servant deceived
c33826	me: for thy servant said,
c33827	I will saddle me an ass,
c33828	that I may ride thereon,
c33829	and go to the king;
c33830	because thy servant <i>is</i> lame.
c33831	And he hath slandered thy servant unto my lord the king;
c33832	but my lord the king <i>is</i> as an angel of God:
c33833	do
c33834	therefore <i>what is</i> good in thine eyes.
c33835	For all <i>of</i> my father's house were
c33836	but dead men before my lord the king:
c33837	yet didst thou set thy servant among them that did eat at thine own table.
c33838	What right therefore have I yet to cry any more
c33839	unto the king?
c33840	And the king said
c33841	unto him, Why speakest thou any more of thy matters?
c33842	I have said,
c33843	Thou and Ziba divide the land.
c33844	And Mephibosheth said unto the king,
c33845	Yea, let him take all,
c33846	forasmuch as my lord the king is come again in peace unto his own house.
c33847	And Barzillai the Gileadite came down from Rogelim,
c33848	and went over Jordan with the king,
c33849	to conduct him over Jordan.
c33850	Now Barzillai was a very aged
c33851	man, <i>even</i> fourscore years old:
c33852	and he had provided the king of sustenance while he lay at Mahanaim;
c33853	for he <i>was</i> a very great man.
c33854	And the king said unto Barzillai,
c33855	Come thou over with
c33856	me, and I will feed thee with me in Jerusalem.
c33857	And Barzillai said unto the king,
c33858	How long have I to live,
c33859	that I should go up with the king unto Jerusalem?
c33860	I <i>am</i> this day fourscore years old:
c33861	<i>and</i> can I discern between good and evil?
c33862	can thy servant taste
c33863	what I eat
c33864	or what I drink?
c33865	can I hear any more the voice of singing men and singing women?
c33866	wherefore then should thy servant be yet a burden unto my lord the king?
c33867	Thy servant will go a little way over Jordan with the king:
c33868	and why should the king recompense it me with such a reward?
c33869	Let thy servant, I pray thee, turn back again,
c33870	that I may die in mine own city, <i>and be buried</i> by the grave of my father and of my mother.
c33871	But behold thy servant Chimham; let him go over with my lord the king;
c33872	and do
c33873	to him what shall seem good unto thee.
c33874	And the king answered,
c33875	Chimham shall go over with
c33876	me, and I will do
c33877	to him that which shall seem good
c33879	unto thee: and whatsoever thou shalt require of
c33880	me, <i>that</i> will I do for thee.
c33881	And all the people went over Jordan.
c33882	And when the king was come over,
c33883	the king kissed Barzillai,
c33884	and blessed
c33885	him; and he returned unto his own place.
c33886	Then the king went on to Gilgal,
c33887	and Chimham went on with
c33888	him: and all the people of Judah conducted the king, and also half the people of Israel.
c33889	And, behold, all the men of Israel came to the king,
c33890	and said unto the king,
c33891	Why have our brethren the men of Judah stolen thee away,
c33892	and have brought the king, and his household, and all David's men with him, over Jordan?
c33894	And all the men of Judah answered the men of Israel,
c33895	Because the king <i>is</i> near of kin to
c33896	us: wherefore then be ye angry for this matter?
c33897	have we eaten at all of the king's
c33898	<i>cost?</i> or hath he given us any gift?
c33899	And the men of Israel answered the men of Judah,
c33900	and said,
c33901	We have ten parts in the king,
c33902	and we have also more <i>right</i> in David than
c33903	ye: why then did ye despise
c33904	us, that our advice should not be first
c33905	had in bringing back our king?
c33906	And the words of the men of Judah were fiercer than the words of the men of Israel.
c33907	And there happened to be there a man of Belial,
c33908	whose name <i>was</i> Sheba, the son of Bichri, a Benjamite: and he blew a trumpet,
c33910	and said,
c33911	We have no part in David,
c33912	neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse: every man
c33913	to his tents,
c33914	O Israel.
c33915	So every man of Israel went up from after David, <i>and</i> followed Sheba the son of Bichri:
c33916	but the men of Judah clave unto their king, from Jordan even to Jerusalem.
c33917	And David came to his house at Jerusalem;
c33918	and the king took the ten women <i>his</i> concubines,
c33919	whom he had left
c33920	to keep the house,
c33921	and put them in ward,
c33922	and fed
c33923	them, but went not in unto
c33924	them. So they were shut up unto the day
c33925	of their death,
c33926	living in widowhood.
c33927	Then said the king to Amasa,
c33928	Assemble me the men of Judah within three days,
c33929	and be thou here present.
c33930	So Amasa went
c33931	to assemble <i>the men of</i> Judah:
c33932	but he tarried longer than the set time
c33933	which he had appointed him.
c33934	And David said to Abishai,
c33935	Now shall Sheba the son of Bichri do us more harm than <i>did</i> Absalom:
c33936	take thou thy lord's servants,
c33937	and pursue after
c33938	him, lest he get him fenced cities,
c33939	and escape us.
c33940	And there went out after him Joab's men, and the Cherethites, and the Pelethites, and all the mighty men:
c33941	and they went out of Jerusalem,
c33942	to pursue after Sheba the son of Bichri.
c33943	When they <i>were</i> at the great stone
c33944	which <i>is</i> in Gibeon,
c33945	Amasa went before
c33946	them. And Joab's garment that he had put on was girded
c33947	unto him, and upon it a girdle <i>with</i> a sword
c33948	fastened upon his loins
c33949	in the sheath
c33950	thereof; and as he went forth
c33951	it fell out.
c33952	And Joab said to Amasa,
c33953	<i>Art</i> thou in health,
c33954	my brother?
c33955	And Joab took Amasa by the beard with the right hand
c33956	to kiss him.
c33957	But Amasa took no heed to the sword
c33958	that <i>was</i> in Joab's hand:
c33959	so he smote him therewith in the fifth
c33960	<i>rib,</i> and shed out his bowels to the ground,
c33961	and struck him not
c33962	again; and he died.
c33963	So Joab and Abishai his brother pursued after Sheba the son of Bichri.
c33964	And one of Joab's men stood by
c33965	him, and said,
c33966	He
c33967	that favoureth Joab,
c33968	and he
c33969	that <i>is</i> for David,
c33970	<i>let him go</i> after Joab.
c33971	And Amasa wallowed in blood in the midst of the highway.
c33972	And when the man saw
c33973	that all the people stood still,
c33974	he removed Amasa out of the highway into the field,
c33975	and cast a cloth upon
c33976	him, when he saw
c33977	that every
c33978	one that came by
c33979	him stood still.
c33980	When he was removed out of the highway,
c33981	all the people went on after Joab,
c33982	to pursue after Sheba the son of Bichri.
c33983	And he went through all the tribes of Israel unto Abel, and to Bethmaachah,
c33984	and all the Berites:
c33985	and they were gathered together,
c33986	and went also after him.
c33987	And they came
c33988	and besieged him in Abel of Bethmaachah,
c33989	and they cast up a bank against the city,
c33990	and it stood in the trench:
c33991	and all the people
c33992	that <i>were</i> with Joab
c33993	battered
c33994	the wall, to throw it down.
c33995	Then cried a wise woman out of the city,
c33996	Hear,
c33997	hear;
c33998	say, I pray you, unto Joab,
c33999	Come near hither,
c34000	that I may speak with thee.
c34001	And when he was come near unto
c34002	her, the woman said,
c34003	<i>Art</i> thou Joab?
c34004	And he answered,
c34005	I
c34006	<i>am he.</i> Then she said
c34007	unto him, Hear the words of thine handmaid.
c34008	And he answered,
c34009	I do hear.
c34010	Then she spake,
c34011	saying,
c34012	They were wont to speak in old time,
c34013	saying,
c34014	They shall surely ask <i>counsel</i> at Abel:
c34015	and so they ended <i>the matter.</i>
c34016	I <i>am one of them that are</i> peaceable <i>and</i> faithful in Israel:
c34017	thou seekest
c34018	to destroy a city and a mother in Israel:
c34019	why wilt thou swallow up the inheritance of the LORD?
c34020	And Joab answered
c34021	and said,
c34022	Far be it,
c34023	far be it
c34024	from me, that I should swallow up
c34025	or destroy.
c34026	The matter <i>is</i> not so:
c34027	but a man of mount Ephraim,
c34028	Sheba the son of Bichri by name,
c34029	hath lifted up his hand against the king, <i>even</i> against David:
c34030	deliver him only,
c34031	and I will depart from the city.
c34032	And the woman said unto Joab,
c34033	Behold, his head shall be thrown to thee over the wall.
c34034	Then the woman went unto all the people in her wisdom.
c34035	And they cut off the head of Sheba the son of Bichri,
c34036	and cast <i>it</i> out to Joab.
c34037	And he blew a trumpet,
c34038	and they retired from the city,
c34039	every man to his tent.
c34040	And Joab returned to Jerusalem unto the king.
c34041	Now Joab <i>was</i> over all the host of Israel:
c34042	and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada <i>was</i> over the Cherethites and over the Pelethites:
c34043	And Adoram <i>was</i> over the tribute:
c34044	and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud <i>was</i> recorder:
c34045	And Sheva <i>was</i> scribe:
c34046	and Zadok and Abiathar <i>were</i> the priests:
c34047	And Ira also the Jairite was a chief ruler about David.
c34048	Then there was a famine in the days of David three years, year after year;
c34049	and David enquired of the LORD.
c34050	And the LORD answered,
c34051	<i>It is</i> for Saul, and for <i>his</i> bloody house,
c34052	because he slew the Gibeonites.
c34053	And the king called the Gibeonites,
c34054	and said unto
c34055	them; (now the Gibeonites
c34056	<i>were</i> not of the children of Israel,
c34057	but of the remnant of the Amorites;
c34058	and the children of Israel had sworn
c34059	unto them: and Saul sought
c34060	to slay
c34061	them in his zeal to the children of Israel and Judah.)
c34062	Wherefore David said unto the Gibeonites,
c34063	What shall I do
c34064	for you? and wherewith shall I make the atonement,
c34065	that ye may bless the inheritance of the LORD?
c34066	And the Gibeonites said
c34067	unto him, We will have no silver nor gold of Saul, nor of his house;
c34068	neither for us shalt thou kill any man
c34070	in Israel.
c34071	And he said,
c34072	What
c34073	ye shall say,
c34074	<i>that</i> will I do for you.
c34075	And they answered the king,
c34076	The man
c34077	that consumed
c34078	us, and that devised
c34079	against us <i>that</i> we should be destroyed
c34080	from remaining in any of the coasts of Israel,
c34081	Let seven men of his sons be delivered
c34082	unto us, and we will hang them up unto the LORD in Gibeah of Saul, <i>whom</i> the LORD did choose.
c34083	And the king said,
c34084	I will give <i>them.</i>
c34085	But the king spared Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan the son of Saul, because of the LORD'S oath
c34086	that <i>was</i> between them, between David and Jonathan the son of Saul.
c34087	But the king took the two sons of Rizpah the daughter of Aiah,
c34088	whom she bare unto Saul,
c34089	Armoni and Mephibosheth;
c34090	and the five sons of Michal the daughter of Saul,
c34091	whom she brought up for Adriel the son of Barzillai the Meholathite:
c34092	And he delivered them into the hands of the Gibeonites,
c34093	and they hanged them in the hill before the LORD:
c34094	and they fell <i>all</i> seven together,
c34095	and were put to death in the days of harvest, in the first <i>days,</i> in the beginning of barley harvest.
c34096	And Rizpah the daughter of Aiah took sackcloth,
c34097	and spread it for her upon the rock, from the beginning of harvest
c34098	until water dropped upon them out of heaven,
c34099	and suffered neither the birds of the air
c34100	to rest on them by day,
c34101	nor the beasts of the field by night.
c34102	And it was told David
c34103	what Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, the concubine of Saul, had done.
c34104	And David went
c34105	and took the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathan his son from the men of Jabeshgilead,
c34106	which had stolen them from the street of Bethshan,
c34107	where the Philistines had hanged them, when
c34108	the Philistines had slain Saul in Gilboa:
c34109	And he brought up from thence the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathan his son;
c34110	and they gathered the bones of them that were hanged.
c34111	And the bones of Saul and Jonathan his son buried they in the country of Benjamin in Zelah, in the sepulchre of Kish his father:
c34112	and they performed all
c34113	that the king commanded.
c34114	And after that God was intreated for the land.
c34115	Moreover the Philistines had yet war again with Israel;
c34116	and David went down, and his servants with
c34117	him, and fought against the Philistines:
c34118	and David waxed faint.
c34119	And Ishbibenob,
c34120	which <i>was</i> of the sons of the giant,
c34121	the weight of whose spear <i>weighed</i> three hundred <i>shekels</i> of brass in weight,
c34122	he being girded with a new
c34123	<i>sword,</i> thought
c34124	to have slain David.
c34125	But Abishai the son of Zeruiah succoured
c34126	him, and smote the Philistine,
c34127	and killed
c34128	him. Then the men of David sware
c34129	unto him, saying,
c34130	Thou shalt go no more out with us to battle,
c34131	that thou quench not the light of Israel.
c34132	And it came to pass after this,
c34133	that there was again a battle with the Philistines at Gob:
c34134	then Sibbechai the Hushathite slew Saph,
c34135	which <i>was</i> of the sons of the giant.
c34136	And there was again a battle in Gob with the Philistines,
c34137	where Elhanan the son of Jaareoregim, a Bethlehemite, slew <i>the brother of</i> Goliath the Gittite,
c34138	the staff of whose spear <i>was</i> like a weaver's beam.
c34139	And there was yet a battle in Gath,
c34140	where was a man of <i>great</i> stature,
c34141	that had on every hand six fingers, and on every foot six toes,
c34142	four and twenty in number;
c34143	and he also was born to the giant.
c34144	And when he defied Israel,
c34145	Jonathan the son of Shimea the brother of David slew him.
c34146	These four were born to the giant in Gath,
c34147	and fell by the hand of David, and by the hand of his servants.
c34148	And David spake unto the LORD the words of this song in the day
c34149	<i>that</i> the LORD had delivered him out of the hand of all his enemies, and out of the hand of Saul:
c34150	And he said,
c34151	The LORD <i>is</i> my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer;
c34152	The God of my rock;
c34153	in him will I trust:
c34154	<i>he is</i> my shield, and the horn of my salvation,
c34155	my high tower, and my refuge, my saviour;
c34156	thou savest me from violence.
c34157	I will call on the LORD, <i>who is</i> worthy to be praised:
c34158	so shall I be saved from mine enemies.
c34159	When the waves of death compassed
c34160	me, the floods of ungodly men made me afraid;
c34161	The sorrows of hell compassed me about;
c34162	the snares of death prevented me;
c34163	In my distress I called upon the LORD,
c34164	and cried to my God:
c34165	and he did hear my voice out of his temple,
c34166	and my cry <i>did enter</i> into his ears.
c34168	Then the earth shook and trembled;
c34169	the foundations of heaven moved
c34170	and shook,
c34171	because he was wroth.
c34172	There went up a smoke out of his nostrils,
c34173	and fire out of his mouth devoured:
c34174	coals were kindled by it.
c34175	He bowed the heavens
c34176	also, and came down;
c34177	and darkness <i>was</i> under his feet.
c34178	And he rode upon a cherub,
c34179	and did fly:
c34180	and he was seen upon the wings of the wind.
c34181	And he made darkness pavilions round about
c34182	him, dark waters, <i>and</i> thick clouds of the skies.
c34183	Through the brightness before him were coals of fire kindled.
c34184	The LORD thundered from heaven,
c34185	and the most High uttered his voice.
c34186	And he sent out arrows,
c34187	and scattered
c34188	them; lightning,
c34189	and discomfited them.
c34190	And the channels of the sea appeared,
c34191	the foundations of the world were discovered, at the rebuking of the LORD, at the blast of the breath of his nostrils.
c34192	He sent from above,
c34193	he took
c34194	me; he drew me out of many waters;
c34195	He delivered me from my strong enemy, <i>and</i> from them that hated
c34196	me: for they were too strong for me.
c34197	They prevented me in the day of my calamity:
c34198	but the LORD was my stay.
c34199	He brought me forth also into a large place:
c34200	he delivered
c34201	me, because he delighted in me.
c34202	The LORD rewarded me according to my righteousness:
c34203	according to the cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me.
c34204	For I have kept the ways of the LORD,
c34205	and have not wickedly departed from my God.
c34206	For all his judgments <i>were</i> before
c34207	me: and <i>as for</i> his statutes,
c34208	I did not depart from them.
c34209	I was also upright
c34210	before him, and have kept myself from mine iniquity.
c34211	Therefore the LORD hath recompensed me according to my righteousness; according to my cleanness in his eye sight.
c34212	With the merciful thou wilt shew thyself merciful,
c34213	<i>and</i> with the upright man thou wilt shew thyself upright.
c34214	With the pure thou wilt shew thyself pure;
c34215	and with the froward thou wilt shew thyself unsavoury.
c34216	And the afflicted people thou wilt save:
c34217	but thine eyes <i>are</i> upon the haughty,
c34218	<i>that</i> thou mayest bring <i>them</i> down.
c34219	For thou <i>art</i> my lamp,
c34220	O LORD:
c34221	and the LORD will lighten my darkness.
c34222	For by thee I have run through a troop:
c34223	by my God have I leaped over a wall.
c34224	<i>As for</i> God,
c34225	his way <i>is</i> perfect;
c34226	the word of the LORD <i>is</i> tried:
c34227	he <i>is</i> a buckler to all
c34228	them that trust in him.
c34229	For who <i>is</i> God, save the LORD?
c34230	and who <i>is</i> a rock, save our God?
c34231	God <i>is</i> my strength
c34232	<i>and</i> power:
c34233	and he maketh my way perfect.
c34234	He maketh my feet like hinds'
c34235	<i>feet:</i> and setteth me upon my high places.
c34236	He teacheth my hands to war;
c34237	so that a bow of steel is broken by mine arms.
c34238	Thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation:
c34239	and thy gentleness
c34240	hath made me great.
c34241	Thou hast enlarged my steps under
c34242	me; so that my feet did not slip.
c34243	I have pursued mine enemies,
c34244	and destroyed
c34245	them; and turned not again
c34246	until I had consumed them.
c34247	And I have consumed
c34248	them, and wounded
c34249	them, that they could not arise:
c34250	yea, they are fallen under my feet.
c34251	For thou hast girded me with strength to battle:
c34252	them that rose up against me hast thou subdued under me.
c34253	of mine enemies,
c34254	Thou hast also given me the necks
c34255	them that hate me.
c34256	that I might destroy
c34257	They looked,
c34258	but <i>there was</i> none to save;
c34259	<i>even</i> unto the LORD,
c34260	but he answered them not.
c34261	Then did I beat them as small as the dust of the earth,
c34262	I did stamp them as the mire of the street,
c34263	<i>and</i> did spread them abroad.
c34264	Thou also hast delivered me from the strivings of my people,
c34265	thou hast kept me <i>to be</i> head of the heathen:
c34266	a people
c34267	<i>which</i> I knew not
c34268	shall serve me.
c34269	Strangers shall submit themselves
c34270	unto me: as soon as they hear,
c34271	they shall be obedient unto me.
c34272	Strangers shall fade away,
c34273	and they shall be afraid out of their close places.
c34274	The LORD liveth;
c34275	and blessed <i>be</i> my rock;
c34276	and exalted be the God of the rock of my salvation.
c34277	It <i>is</i> God
c34278	that avengeth
c34279	me, and that bringeth down the people under me,
c34280	And that bringeth me forth from mine enemies:
c34281	thou also hast lifted me up on high above them that rose up
c34282	against me: thou hast delivered me from the violent man.
c34283	Therefore I will give thanks
c34284	unto thee, O LORD,
c34285	among the heathen,
c34286	and I will sing praises unto thy name.
c34287	<i>He is</i> the tower of salvation for his king:
c34288	and sheweth mercy to his anointed, unto David, and to his seed for evermore.
c34289	Now these <i>be</i> the last words of David.
c34290	David the son of Jesse said, and the man <i>who was</i> raised up on high,
c34292	the anointed of the God of Jacob, and the sweet psalmist of Israel, said,
c34293	The Spirit of the LORD spake
c34294	by me, and his word <i>was</i> in my tongue.
c34295	The God of Israel said,
c34296	the Rock of Israel spake
c34297	to me, He that ruleth over men <i>must be</i> just,
c34298	ruling in the fear of God.
c34299	And <i>he shall be</i> as the light of the morning,
c34300	<i>when</i> the sun riseth,
c34301	<i>even</i> a morning
c34302	without clouds;
c34303	<i>as</i> the tender grass <i>springing</i> out of the earth by clear shining after rain.
c34304	Although my house <i>be</i> not so with God;
c34305	yet he hath made with me an everlasting covenant,
c34306	ordered in all
c34307	<i>things,</i> and sure:
c34308	for <i>this is</i> all my salvation, and all <i>my</i> desire,
c34309	although he make <i>it</i> not to grow.
c34310	But <i>the sons</i> of Belial
c34311	<i>shall be</i> all of them as thorns thrust away,
c34312	because they cannot be taken with hands:
c34313	But the man <i>that</i> shall touch
c34314	them must be fenced with iron and the staff of a spear;
c34315	and they shall be utterly burned with fire in the <i>same</i> place.
c34316	These <i>be</i> the names of the mighty men
c34317	whom David
c34318	had: The Tachmonite that sat in the seat,
c34319	chief among the captains; the same
c34320	<i>was</i> Adino the Eznite:
c34321	<i>he lift up his spear</i> against eight hundred, whom he slew at one time.
c34322	And after him <i>was</i> Eleazar the son of Dodo the Ahohite, <i>one</i> of the three mighty men
c34323	with David,
c34324	when they defied the Philistines
c34325	<i>that</i> were there gathered together to battle,
c34326	and the men of Israel were gone away:
c34327	He arose,
c34328	and smote the Philistines
c34329	until his hand was weary,
c34330	and his hand clave unto the sword:
c34331	and the LORD wrought a great victory that day;
c34332	and the people returned after
c34333	him only to spoil.
c34334	And after him <i>was</i> Shammah the son of Agee the Hararite.
c34335	And the Philistines were gathered together into a troop,
c34336	where was a piece of ground
c34337	full of lentiles:
c34338	and the people fled from the Philistines.
c34339	But he stood in the midst of the ground,
c34340	and defended
c34341	it, and slew the Philistines:
c34342	and the LORD wrought a great victory.
c34343	And three of the thirty chief went down,
c34344	and came to David in the harvest time unto the cave of Adullam:
c34345	and the troop of the Philistines pitched in the valley of Rephaim.
c34346	And David <i>was</i> then in an hold,
c34347	and the garrison of the Philistines <i>was</i> then <i>in</i> Bethlehem.
c34348	And David longed,
c34349	and said,
c34350	Oh that one would give me drink of the water of the well of Bethlehem,
c34351	which <i>is</i> by the gate!
c34352	And the three mighty men brake through the host of the Philistines,
c34353	and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem,
c34354	that <i>was</i> by the gate,
c34355	and took
c34356	<i>it,</i> and brought <i>it</i> to David:
c34357	nevertheless he would not
c34358	drink
c34359	thereof, but poured it out unto the LORD.
c34360	And he said,
c34361	Be it far
c34362	from me, O LORD,
c34363	that I should do this:
c34364	<i>is not this</i> the blood of the men
c34365	that went in jeopardy of their lives?
c34366	therefore he would not
c34367	drink
c34368	it. These things did these three mighty men.
c34369	And Abishai, the brother of Joab, the son of Zeruiah,
c34370	was chief among three. And he
c34371	lifted up his spear against three hundred, <i>and</i> slew
c34372	<i>them,</i> and had the name among three.
c34373	of three?
c34375	Was he not most honourable
c34376	therefore he was their captain:
c34377	howbeit he attained not unto the <i>first</i> three.
c34378	And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man, of Kabzeel, who had done many acts,
c34379	he slew two lionlike men of Moab:
c34380	he went down
c34381	also and slew a lion in the midst of a pit in time of snow:
c34382	And he slew an Egyptian, a goodly man:
c34383	and the Egyptian had a spear in his hand;
c34384	but he went down to him with a staff,
c34385	and plucked the spear out of the Egyptian's hand,
c34386	and slew him with his own spear.
c34387	These <i>things</i> did Benaiah the son of Jehoiada,
c34388	and had the name among three mighty men.
c34389	He was more honourable than the thirty,
c34390	but he attained not to the <i>first</i> three.
c34391	And David set him over his guard.
c34392	Asahel the brother of Joab <i>was</i> one of the thirty;
c34393	Elhanan the son of Dodo of Bethlehem,
c34394	Shammah the Harodite,
c34395	Elika the Harodite,
c34396	Helez the Paltite,
c34397	Ira the son of Ikkesh the Tekoite,
c34398	Abiezer the Anethothite,
c34399	Mebunnai the Hushathite,
c34400	Zalmon the Ahohite,
c34401	Maharai the Netophathite,
c34402	Heleb the son of Baanah, a Netophathite,
c34403	Ittai the son of Ribai out of Gibeah of the children of Benjamin,
c34404	Benaiah the Pirathonite,
c34405	Hiddai of the brooks of Gaash,
c34406	Abialbon the Arbathite,
c34407	Azmaveth the Barhumite,
c34408	Eliahba the Shaalbonite,
c34409	of the sons of Jashen, Jonathan,
c34410	Shammah the Hararite,
c34411	Ahiam the son of Sharar the Hararite,
c34412	Eliphelet the son of Ahasbai, the son of the Maachathite,
c34413	Eliam the son of Ahithophel the Gilonite,
c34414	Hezrai the Carmelite,
c34415	Paarai the Arbite,
c34416	Igal the son of Nathan of Zobah,
c34417	Bani the Gadite,
c34418	Zelek the Ammonite,
c34419	Naharai the Beerothite, armourbearer to Joab the son of Zeruiah,
c34420	Ira an Ithrite,
c34421	Gareb an Ithrite,
c34422	Uriah the Hittite:
c34423	thirty and seven in all.
c34424	And again the anger of the LORD
c34425	was kindled against Israel,
c34426	and he moved David
c34427	against them to say,
c34428	Go,
c34429	number Israel and Judah.
c34430	For the king said to Joab the captain of the host,
c34431	which <i>was</i> with
c34432	him, Go now through all the tribes of Israel, from Dan even to Beersheba,
c34433	and number ye the people,
c34434	that I may know the number of the people.
c34435	And Joab said unto the king,
c34436	Now the LORD thy God add unto the people, how many soever they be, an hundredfold,
c34437	and that the eyes of my lord the king may see
c34439	<i>it:</i> but why doth my lord the king delight in this thing?
c34440	Notwithstanding the king's word prevailed against Joab, and against the captains of the host.
c34441	And Joab and the captains of the host went out from the presence of the king,
c34442	to number the people of Israel.
c34443	And they passed over Jordan,
c34444	and pitched in Aroer, on the right side of the city
c34445	that <i>lieth</i> in the midst of the river of Gad,
c34446	and toward Jazer:
c34447	Then they came to Gilead,
c34448	and to the land of Tahtimhodshi;
c34449	and they came to Danjaan,
c34450	and about to Zidon,
c34451	And came to the strong hold of Tyre, and to all the cities of the Hivites, and of the Canaanites:
c34452	and they went out to the south of Judah, <i>even</i> to Beersheba.
c34453	So when they had gone through all the land,
c34454	they came to Jerusalem at the end of nine months and twenty days.
c34455	And Joab gave up the sum of the number of the people unto the king:
c34456	and there were in Israel eight hundred thousand valiant men
c34457	that drew the sword;
c34458	and the men of Judah <i>were</i> five hundred thousand men.
c34459	And David's heart smote him after that
c34460	he had numbered the people.
c34461	And David said unto the LORD,
c34462	I have sinned greatly
c34463	in that I have done:
c34464	and now,
c34466	I beseech thee, O LORD, take away the iniquity of thy servant;
c34467	for I have done very foolishly.
c34468	For when David was up in the morning,
c34469	the word of the LORD came unto the prophet Gad, David's seer,
c34470	saying,
c34471	Go
c34473	and say unto David, Thus saith the LORD,
c34474	I offer thee three
c34475	<i>things;</i> choose thee one of
c34476	them, that I may <i>do</i> <i>it</i> unto thee.
c34477	So Gad came to David,
c34478	and told
c34479	him, and said
c34480	unto him, Shall seven years of famine come unto thee in thy land?
c34481	or wilt thou flee three months before thine enemies,
c34482	while they pursue
c34483	thee? or that there be three days' pestilence in thy land?
c34484	now advise,
c34485	and see
c34486	what answer I shall return to him that sent me.
c34487	And David said unto Gad,
c34488	I am in a great strait:
c34489	let us fall now into the hand of the LORD;
c34490	for his mercies <i>are</i> great:
c34491	and let me not fall into the hand of man.
c34492	So the LORD sent a pestilence upon Israel from the morning even to the time appointed: and there died of
c34493	the people from Dan even to Beersheba seventy thousand men.
c34494	And when the angel stretched out his hand upon Jerusalem
c34495	to destroy
c34496	it, the LORD repented him of the evil,
c34497	and said to the angel
c34498	that destroyed the people,
c34499	It is enough: stay now
c34500	thine hand.
c34501	And the angel of the LORD was by the threshingplace of Araunah the Jebusite.
c34502	And David spake unto the LORD
c34503	when he saw the angel
c34504	that smote the people,
c34505	and said,
c34506	Lo, I have sinned,
c34507	and I have done wickedly:
c34508	but these sheep,
c34509	what have they done?
c34510	let thine hand, I pray thee, be against me, and against my father's house.
c34511	And Gad came that day to David,
c34512	and said
c34513	unto him, Go up,
c34514	rear an altar unto the LORD in the threshingfloor of Araunah the Jebusite.
c34515	And David, according to the saying of Gad, went up
c34516	as the LORD commanded.
c34517	And Araunah looked,
c34518	and saw the king and his servants
c34519	coming on toward
c34520	him: and Araunah went out,
c34521	and bowed himself before the king
c34522	on his face upon the ground.
c34523	And Araunah said,
c34524	Wherefore is my lord the king come to his servant?
c34525	And David said,
c34526	To buy the threshingfloor of
c34527	thee, to build an altar unto the LORD,
c34528	that the plague may be stayed from the people.
c34529	And Araunah said unto David,
c34531	Let my lord the king take and offer up
c34532	what <i>seemeth</i> good unto him:
c34533	behold, <i>here be</i> oxen for burnt sacrifice,
c34534	and threshing instruments and <i>other</i> instruments of the oxen for wood.
c34535	All these <i>things</i> did Araunah, <i>as</i> a king, give
c34538	unto the king. And Araunah said unto the king,
c34539	The LORD thy God accept thee.
c34540	And the king said unto Araunah,
c34541	Nay;
c34542	but I will surely buy <i>it</i> of thee at a price:
c34543	neither will I offer burnt offerings unto the LORD my God of that which doth cost me nothing.
c34544	So David bought the threshingfloor and the oxen for fifty shekels of silver.
c34545	And David built there an altar unto the LORD,
c34546	and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings.
c34547	So the LORD was intreated for the land,
c34548	and the plague was stayed from Israel.
c34549	Now king David was old
c34550	<i>and</i> stricken in years;
c34551	and they covered him with clothes,
c34552	but he gat no heat.
c34553	Wherefore his servants said
c34554	unto him, Let there be sought for my lord the king a young virgin:
c34555	and let her stand before the king,
c34556	and let her cherish
c34557	him, and let her lie in thy bosom,
c34558	that my lord the king may get heat.
c34559	So they sought for a fair damsel throughout all the coasts of Israel,
c34560	and found Abishag a Shunammite,
c34561	and brought her to the king.
c34562	And the damsel <i>was</i> very fair,
c34563	and cherished the king,
c34564	and ministered
c34565	to him: but the king knew her not.
c34566	Then Adonijah the son of Haggith exalted himself,
c34567	saying,
c34568	I will be king:
c34569	and he prepared him chariots and horsemen, and fifty men
c34570	to run before him.
c34571	And his father had not displeased him at any time
c34572	in saying,
c34573	Why hast thou done so?
c34574	and he also <i>was a</i> very goodly
c34575	<i>man;</i> and <i>his mother</i> bare him after Absalom.
c34576	And he conferred with Joab the son of Zeruiah, and with Abiathar the priest:
c34577	and they following Adonijah helped <i>him.</i>
c34578	But Zadok the priest, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and Nathan the prophet, and Shimei, and Rei, and the mighty men
c34579	which <i>belonged</i> to David,
c34580	were not with Adonijah.
c34581	And Adonijah slew sheep and oxen and fat cattle by the stone of Zoheleth,
c34582	which <i>is</i> by Enrogel,
c34583	and called all his brethren the king's sons, and all the men of Judah the king's servants:
c34584	But Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah, and the mighty men, and Solomon his brother, he called not.
c34585	Wherefore Nathan spake unto Bathsheba the mother of Solomon,
c34586	saying,
c34587	Hast thou not heard
c34588	that Adonijah the son of Haggith doth reign,
c34589	and David our lord knoweth <i>it</i> not?
c34590	Now therefore come,
c34591	let me, I pray thee, give thee counsel,
c34592	that thou mayest save thine own life, and the life of thy son Solomon.
c34593	Go
c34594	and get thee in unto king David,
c34595	and say unto
c34596	him, Didst not thou,
c34597	my lord, O king,
c34598	swear unto thine handmaid,
c34599	saying,
c34600	Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after
c34601	me, and he shall sit upon my throne?
c34602	why then doth Adonijah reign?
c34603	Behold, while thou yet talkest there with the king,
c34604	I also will come in after
c34605	thee, and confirm thy words.
c34606	And Bathsheba went in unto the king into the chamber:
c34607	and the king was very old;
c34608	and Abishag the Shunammite ministered unto the king.
c34609	And Bathsheba bowed,
c34610	and did obeisance unto the king.
c34611	And the king said,
c34612	What wouldest thou?
c34613	And she said
c34614	unto him, My lord,
c34615	thou swarest by the LORD thy God unto thine handmaid,
c34616	<i>saying,</i> Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after
c34617	me, and he shall sit upon my throne.
c34618	And now,
c34619	behold, Adonijah reigneth;
c34620	and now,
c34621	my lord the king,
c34622	thou knowest <i>it</i> not:
c34623	And he hath slain oxen and fat cattle and sheep in abundance,
c34624	and hath called all the sons of the king, and Abiathar the priest, and Joab the captain of the host:
c34625	but Solomon thy servant hath he not called.
c34626	And thou,
c34627	my lord, O king,
c34628	the eyes of all Israel <i>are</i> upon
c34629	thee, that thou shouldest tell
c34630	them who shall sit on the throne of my lord the king after him.
c34631	Otherwise it shall come to pass,
c34632	when my lord the king shall sleep with his fathers,
c34633	that I and my son Solomon shall be counted offenders.
c34634	And, lo,
c34635	while she yet talked with the king,
c34636	Nathan the prophet also came in.
c34637	And they told the king,
c34638	saying,
c34639	Behold Nathan the prophet.
c34640	And when he was come in before the king,
c34641	he bowed himself before the king with his face to the ground.
c34642	And Nathan said,
c34643	My lord, O king,
c34644	hast thou said,
c34645	Adonijah shall reign after
c34646	me, and he shall sit upon my throne?
c34647	For he is gone down this day,
c34648	and hath slain oxen and fat cattle and sheep in abundance,
c34649	and hath called all the king's sons, and the captains of the host, and Abiathar the priest;
c34650	and, behold, they eat
c34651	and drink before
c34652	him, and say,
c34653	God save king Adonijah.
c34654	But me, <i>even</i> me thy servant, and Zadok the priest, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and thy servant Solomon, hath he not called.
c34655	Is this thing done by my lord the king,
c34656	and thou hast not shewed <i>it</i> unto thy servant,
c34657	who should sit on the throne of my lord the king after him?
c34658	Then king David answered
c34659	and said,
c34660	Call me Bathsheba.
c34661	And she came into the king's presence,
c34662	and stood before the king.
c34663	And the king sware,
c34664	and said,
c34665	<i>As</i> the LORD liveth,
c34666	that hath redeemed my soul out of all distress,
c34667	Even
c34668	as I sware unto thee by the LORD God of Israel,
c34669	saying,
c34670	Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after
c34671	me, and he shall sit upon my throne in my stead;
c34672	even so will I certainly do this day.
c34673	Then Bathsheba bowed
c34674	with <i>her</i> face to the earth,
c34675	and did reverence to the king,
c34676	and said,
c34677	Let my lord king David live for ever.
c34678	And king David said,
c34679	Call me Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada.
c34680	And they came before the king.
c34681	The king also said
c34682	unto them, Take with you the servants of your lord,
c34683	and cause Solomon my son to ride upon mine own mule,
c34685	and bring him down to Gihon:
c34686	And let Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet anoint him there king over Israel:
c34687	and blow ye with the trumpet,
c34688	and say,
c34689	God save king Solomon.
c34690	Then ye shall come up after
c34691	him, that he may come
c34692	and sit upon my throne;
c34693	for he shall be king in my stead:
c34694	and I have appointed
c34695	him to be ruler over Israel and over Judah.
c34696	And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada answered the king,
c34697	and said,
c34698	Amen:
c34699	the LORD God of my lord the king say so <i>too.</i>
c34700	As the LORD hath been with my lord the king,
c34701	even so be he with Solomon,
c34702	and make his throne greater than the throne of my lord king David.
c34703	So Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites, and the Pelethites, went down,
c34704	and caused Solomon to ride upon king David's mule,
c34705	and brought him to Gihon.
c34706	And Zadok the priest took an horn of oil out of the tabernacle,
c34707	and anointed Solomon.
c34708	And they blew the trumpet;
c34709	and all the people said,
c34710	God save king Solomon.
c34711	And all the people came up after
c34712	him, and the people piped with pipes,
c34713	and rejoiced with great joy,
c34714	so that the earth rent with the sound of them.
c34715	And Adonijah and all the guests that <i>were</i> with him heard
c34717	<i>it</i> as they had made an end
c34718	of eating.
c34719	And when Joab heard the sound of the trumpet,
c34720	he said,
c34721	Wherefore <i>is this</i> noise of the city being in an uproar?
c34722	And while he yet spake,
c34723	behold, Jonathan the son of Abiathar the priest came:
c34724	and Adonijah said
c34725	unto him, Come in;
c34726	for thou <i>art</i> a valiant man,
c34727	and bringest good tidings.
c34728	And Jonathan answered
c34729	and said to Adonijah,
c34730	Verily
c34731	our lord king David hath made Solomon king.
c34732	And the king hath sent with him Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites, and the Pelethites,
c34733	and they have caused him to ride upon the king's mule:
c34734	And Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet have anointed him king in Gihon:
c34735	and they are come up from thence rejoicing,
c34736	so that the city rang
c34737	again. This <i>is</i> the noise
c34738	that ye have heard.
c34739	And also Solomon sitteth on the throne of the kingdom.
c34740	And moreover the king's servants came
c34741	to bless our lord king David,
c34742	saying,
c34743	God make the name of Solomon better than thy name,
c34744	and make his throne greater than thy throne.
c34745	And the king bowed himself upon the bed.
c34746	And also thus said the king,
c34747	Blessed <i>be</i> the LORD God of Israel,
c34748	which hath given <i>one</i> to sit on my throne this day,
c34750	mine eyes even seeing <i>it.</i>
c34751	were afraid, and rose up,
c34752	And all the guests that <i>were</i> with Adonijah
c34754	and went
c34755	every man his way.
c34756	And Adonijah feared because of Solomon,
c34757	and arose,
c34758	and went,
c34759	and caught hold on the horns of the altar.
c34760	And it was told Solomon,
c34761	saying,
c34762	Behold, Adonijah feareth king Solomon:
c34763	for, lo, he hath caught hold on the horns of the altar,
c34764	saying,
c34765	Let king Solomon swear unto me to day
c34766	that he will not slay his servant with the sword.
c34767	And Solomon said,
c34768	If he will shew himself a worthy man,
c34769	there shall not an hair of him fall to the earth:
c34770	but if wickedness shall be found
c34771	in him, he shall die.
c34772	So king Solomon sent,
c34773	and they brought him down from the altar.
c34774	And he came
c34775	and bowed himself to king Solomon:
c34776	and Solomon said
c34777	unto him, Go to thine house.
c34778	Now the days of David drew nigh
c34779	that he should die;
c34780	and he charged Solomon his son,
c34781	saying,
c34782	I go the way of all the earth:
c34783	be thou strong
c34784	therefore, and shew thyself a man;
c34785	And keep the charge of the LORD thy God,
c34786	to walk in his ways,
c34787	to keep his statutes, and his commandments, and his judgments, and his testimonies,
c34788	as it is written in the law of Moses,
c34789	that thou mayest prosper in all
c34790	that thou doest,
c34791	and whithersoever
c34792	thou turnest thyself:
c34793	That the LORD may continue his word
c34794	which he spake concerning
c34795	me, saying,
c34796	If thy children take heed to their way,
c34797	to walk before me in truth with all their heart and with all their soul,
c34799	there shall not fail thee (said he) a man on the throne of Israel.
c34800	Moreover thou knowest
c34801	also what Joab the son of Zeruiah did
c34802	to me, <i>and</i> what he did to the two captains of the hosts of Israel, unto Abner the son of Ner, and unto Amasa the son of Jether,
c34803	whom he slew,
c34804	and shed the blood of war in peace,
c34805	and put the blood of war upon his girdle
c34806	that <i>was</i> about his loins,
c34807	and in his shoes
c34808	that <i>were</i> on his feet.
c34809	Do therefore according to thy wisdom,
c34810	and let not his hoar head go down to the grave in peace.
c34811	But shew kindness unto the sons of Barzillai the Gileadite,
c34812	and let them be of those that eat at thy table:
c34813	for so they came to
c34814	me when I fled because of Absalom thy brother.
c34815	And, behold, <i>thou hast</i> with thee Shimei the son of Gera, a Benjamite of Bahurim,
c34816	which cursed me with a grievous curse in the day
c34817	when I went to Mahanaim:
c34818	but he came down
c34819	to meet
c34820	me at Jordan,
c34821	and I sware to him by the LORD,
c34822	saying,
c34823	I will not put thee to death with the sword.
c34824	Now
c34825	therefore hold him not guiltless:
c34826	for thou <i>art</i> a wise man,
c34827	and knowest
c34828	what thou oughtest to do
c34829	unto him; but his hoar head bring thou down to the grave with blood.
c34830	So David slept with his fathers,
c34831	and was buried in the city of David.
c34832	And the days
c34833	that David reigned over Israel
c34834	<i>were</i> forty years:
c34835	seven years reigned he in Hebron,
c34836	and thirty and three years reigned he in Jerusalem.
c34837	Then sat Solomon upon the throne of David his father;
c34838	and his kingdom was established greatly.
c34839	And Adonijah the son of Haggith came to Bathsheba the mother of Solomon.
c34840	And she said,
c34841	thou peaceably?
c34842	Comest
c34843	And he said,
c34844	Peaceably.
c34845	He said
c34846	moreover, I have somewhat to say unto
c34847	thee. And she said,
c34848	Say on.
c34849	And he said,
c34850	Thou knowest
c34851	that the kingdom was
c34852	mine, and <i>that</i> all Israel set their faces on
c34853	me, that I should reign:
c34854	howbeit the kingdom is turned about,
c34855	and is become my brother's:
c34856	for it was his from the LORD.
c34857	And now
c34858	I ask one petition of
c34859	thee, deny me not.
c34860	And she said unto
c34861	him, Say on.
c34862	And he said,
c34863	Speak, I pray thee, unto Solomon the king,
c34864	(for he will not say thee nay,)
c34865	that he give me Abishag the Shunammite to wife.
c34866	And Bathsheba said,
c34867	Well;
c34868	I will speak for thee unto the king.
c34869	Bathsheba therefore went unto king Solomon,
c34870	to speak unto him for Adonijah.
c34871	And the king rose up
c34872	to meet
c34873	her, and bowed himself
c34874	unto her, and sat down on his throne,
c34875	and caused a seat to be set for the king's mother;
c34876	and she sat on his right hand.
c34877	Then she said,
c34878	I desire one small petition of
c34879	thee; <i>I pray thee,</i> say me not nay.
c34880	And the king said
c34881	unto her, Ask on,
c34882	my mother:
c34883	for I will not say thee nay.
c34884	And she said,
c34885	Let Abishag the Shunammite be given to Adonijah thy brother to wife.
c34886	And king Solomon answered
c34887	and said unto his mother,
c34888	And why dost thou ask Abishag the Shunammite for Adonijah?
c34889	ask for him the kingdom
c34890	also; for he <i>is</i> mine elder brother;
c34892	even for him, and for Abiathar the priest, and for Joab the son of Zeruiah.
c34893	Then king Solomon sware by the LORD,
c34894	saying,
c34895	God do so
c34896	to me, and more also,
c34897	if Adonijah have not spoken this word against his own life.
c34898	Now
c34899	therefore, <i>as</i> the LORD liveth,
c34900	which hath established
c34901	me, and set me on the throne of David my father,
c34902	and who hath made me an house,
c34903	as he promised,
c34904	Adonijah shall be put to death this day.
c34905	And king Solomon sent by the hand of Benaiah the son of Jehoiada;
c34906	and he fell
c34907	upon him that he died.
c34908	And unto Abiathar the priest said the king,
c34909	Get thee to Anathoth, unto thine own fields;
c34910	for thou <i>art</i> worthy of death:
c34911	but I will not at this time put thee to death,
c34912	because thou barest the ark of the Lord GOD before David my father,
c34913	and because thou hast been afflicted in all
c34914	wherein my father was afflicted.
c34915	So Solomon thrust out Abiathar
c34916	from being priest unto the LORD;
c34917	that he might fulfil the word of the LORD,
c34918	which he spake concerning the house of Eli in Shiloh.
c34919	Then tidings came to Joab:
c34920	for Joab had turned after Adonijah,
c34921	though he turned not after Absalom.
c34922	And Joab fled unto the tabernacle of the LORD,
c34923	and caught hold on the horns of the altar.
c34924	And it was told king Solomon
c34925	that Joab was fled unto the tabernacle of the LORD;
c34926	and, behold, <i>he is</i> by the altar.
c34927	Then Solomon sent Benaiah the son of Jehoiada,
c34928	saying,
c34929	Go,
c34930	fall upon him.
c34931	And Benaiah came to the tabernacle of the LORD,
c34932	and said unto
c34933	him, Thus saith the king,
c34934	Come forth.
c34935	And he said,
c34936	Nay;
c34937	but I will die here.
c34938	And Benaiah brought the king word
c34939	again, saying,
c34940	Thus said Joab,
c34941	and thus he answered me.
c34942	And the king said
c34943	unto him, Do
c34944	as he hath said,
c34945	and fall
c34946	upon him, and bury
c34947	him; that thou mayest take away the innocent blood,
c34948	which Joab shed,
c34949	from me, and from the house of my father.
c34950	And the LORD shall return his blood upon his own head,
c34951	who fell upon two men
c34952	more righteous and better than
c34953	he, and slew them with the sword,
c34954	my father David not knowing
c34955	<i>thereof, to wit,</i> Abner the son of Ner, captain of the host of Israel, and Amasa the son of Jether, captain of the host of Judah.
c34956	Their blood shall therefore return upon the head of Joab, and upon the head of his seed for ever:
c34957	but upon David, and upon his seed, and upon his house, and upon his throne, shall there be peace for ever from the LORD.
c34958	So Benaiah the son of Jehoiada went up,
c34959	and fell
c34960	upon him, and slew
c34961	him: and he was buried in his own house in the wilderness.
c34962	And the king put Benaiah the son of Jehoiada in his room over the host:
c34963	and Zadok the priest did the king put in the room of Abiathar.
c34964	And the king sent
c34965	and called for Shimei,
c34966	and said
c34967	unto him, Build thee an house in Jerusalem,
c34968	and dwell there,
c34969	and go not forth thence any whither.
c34970	For it shall be,
c34971	<i>that</i> on the day
c34972	thou goest out,
c34973	and passest over the brook Kidron,
c34974	thou shalt know for certain
c34975	that thou shalt surely die:
c34976	thy blood shall be upon thine own head.
c34977	And Shimei said unto the king,
c34978	The saying <i>is</i> good:
c34979	as my lord the king hath said,
c34980	so will thy servant do.
c34981	And Shimei dwelt in Jerusalem many days.
c34982	And it came to pass at the end of three years,
c34983	that two of the servants of Shimei ran away unto Achish son of Maachah king of Gath.
c34984	And they told Shimei,
c34985	saying,
c34986	Behold, thy servants <i>be</i> in Gath.
c34987	And Shimei arose,
c34988	and saddled his ass,
c34989	and went to Gath to Achish
c34990	to seek his servants:
c34991	and Shimei went,
c34992	and brought his servants from Gath.
c34993	And it was told Solomon
c34994	that Shimei had gone from Jerusalem to Gath,
c34995	and was come again.
c34996	And the king sent
c34997	and called for Shimei,
c34998	and said unto
c34999	him, Did I not make thee to swear by the LORD,
c35000	and protested
c35001	unto thee, saying,
c35002	on the day
c35003	thou goest out,
c35004	and walkest abroad any whither,
c35005	Know for a certain,
c35006	that thou shalt surely die?
c35007	and thou saidst unto
c35008	me, The word <i>that</i> I have heard <i>is</i> good.
c35010	Why then hast thou not kept the oath of the LORD, and the commandment
c35011	that I have charged thee with?
c35012	The king said moreover to Shimei,
c35013	Thou knowest all the wickedness
c35014	which thine heart is privy to,
c35015	that thou didst to David my father:
c35016	therefore the LORD shall return thy wickedness upon thine own head;
c35017	And king Solomon <i>shall be</i> blessed,
c35018	and the throne of David shall be established before the LORD for ever.
c35019	So the king commanded Benaiah the son of Jehoiada;
c35020	which went out,
c35021	and fell
c35022	upon him, that he died.
c35023	And the kingdom was established in the hand of Solomon.
c35024	And Solomon made affinity with Pharaoh king of Egypt,
c35025	and took Pharaoh's daughter,
c35026	and brought her into the city of David,
c35027	until he had made an end
c35028	of building his own house, and the house of the LORD, and the wall of Jerusalem round about.
c35029	Only the people sacrificed in high places,
c35030	because there was no house built unto the name of the LORD, until those days.
c35031	And Solomon loved the LORD,
c35032	walking in the statutes of David his father:
c35033	only he sacrificed and burnt incense in high places.
c35035	And the king went to Gibeon
c35036	to sacrifice there;
c35037	for that <i>was</i> the great high place:
c35038	a thousand burnt offerings did Solomon offer upon that altar.
c35039	In Gibeon the LORD appeared to Solomon in a dream by night:
c35040	and God said,
c35041	Ask
c35042	what I shall give thee.
c35043	And Solomon said,
c35044	Thou hast shewed unto thy servant David my father great mercy,
c35045	according as he walked before thee in truth, and in righteousness, and in uprightness of heart with
c35046	thee; and thou hast kept for him this great kindness,
c35047	that thou hast given him a son
c35048	to sit on his throne,
c35049	as <i>it is</i> this day.
c35050	And now,
c35051	O LORD my God,
c35052	thou hast made thy servant king instead of David my father:
c35053	and I <i>am but</i> a little child:
c35054	I know not
c35055	<i>how</i> to go out
c35056	or come in.
c35057	And thy servant <i>is</i> in the midst of thy people
c35058	which thou hast chosen,
c35059	a great people,
c35060	that cannot be numbered
c35061	nor counted for multitude.
c35062	Give therefore thy servant an understanding heart
c35063	to judge thy people,
c35064	that I may discern between good and bad:
c35065	for who is able
c35066	to judge this thy so great a people?
c35067	And the speech pleased the Lord,
c35068	that Solomon had asked this thing.
c35069	And God said unto
c35070	him, Because thou hast asked this thing,
c35071	and hast not asked for thyself long life;
c35072	neither hast asked riches
c35073	for thyself, nor hast asked the life of thine enemies;
c35074	but hast asked
c35075	for thyself understanding
c35076	to discern judgment;
c35077	Behold, I have done according to thy words:
c35078	lo, I have given thee a wise and an understanding heart;
c35079	so that there was none like thee before
c35080	thee, neither after thee shall any arise like unto thee.
c35082	And I have also given thee that which thou hast not asked,
c35083	both riches, and honour:
c35084	so that there shall not be any among the kings like unto thee all thy days.
c35085	And if thou wilt walk in my ways,
c35086	to keep my statutes and my commandments,
c35087	as thy father David did walk,
c35088	then I will lengthen thy days.
c35089	And Solomon awoke;
c35090	and, behold, <i>it was</i> a dream.
c35091	And he came to Jerusalem,
c35092	and stood before the ark of the covenant of the LORD,
c35093	and offered up burnt offerings,
c35094	and offered peace offerings,
c35095	and made a feast to all his servants.
c35096	Then came there two women, <i>that were</i> harlots, unto the king,
c35097	and stood before him.
c35098	And the one woman said,
c35099	O my lord,
c35100	I and this woman dwell in one house;
c35101	and I was delivered of a child with her in the house.
c35102	And it came to pass the third day
c35103	after that I was delivered,
c35104	that this woman was delivered also:
c35105	and we <i>were</i> together;
c35106	<i>there was</i> no stranger with us in the house,
c35107	save we two in the house.
c35108	And this woman's child died in the night;
c35109	because she overlaid it.
c35110	And she arose at midnight,
c35111	and took my son from beside
c35112	me, while thine handmaid slept,
c35113	and laid it in her bosom,
c35114	and laid her dead child in my bosom.
c35115	And when I rose in the morning
c35116	to give my child suck,
c35117	behold,
c35118	it was dead:
c35119	but when I had considered it in the morning,
c35120	behold,
c35121	it was not my son,
c35122	which I did bear.
c35123	And the other woman said,
c35124	Nay;
c35125	but the living <i>is</i> my son,
c35126	and the dead <i>is</i> thy son.
c35127	And this said,
c35128	No;
c35129	but the dead <i>is</i> thy son,
c35130	and the living <i>is</i> my son.
c35131	Thus they spake before the king.
c35132	Then said the king,
c35133	The one saith,
c35134	This <i>is</i> my son that liveth,
c35135	and thy son <i>is</i> the dead:
c35136	and the other saith,
c35137	Nay;
c35138	but thy son <i>is</i> the dead,
c35139	and my son <i>is</i> the living.
c35140	And the king said,
c35141	Bring me a sword.
c35142	And they brought a sword before the king.
c35143	And the king said,
c35144	Divide the living child in two,
c35145	and give half to the one,
c35146	and half to the other.
c35147	Then spake the woman
c35148	whose the living child
c35149	<i>was</i> unto the king,
c35150	for her bowels yearned upon her son,
c35151	and she said,
c35152	O my lord,
c35153	give her the living child,
c35154	and in no wise slay
c35155	it. But the other said,
c35156	neither
c35157	mine nor
c35158	Let it be
c35159	thine, <i>but</i> divide <i>it.</i>
c35160	Then the king answered
c35161	and said,
c35162	Give her the living child,
c35163	and in no wise slay
c35164	it: she <i>is</i> the mother thereof.
c35165	And all Israel heard of the judgment
c35166	which the king had judged;
c35167	and they feared the king:
c35168	for they saw
c35169	that the wisdom of God <i>was</i> in him,
c35170	to do judgment.
c35171	So king Solomon was king over all Israel.
c35172	And these <i>were</i> the princes
c35173	which
c35174	he had; Azariah the son of Zadok the priest,
c35175	Elihoreph and Ahiah, the sons of Shisha, scribes;
c35176	Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud, the recorder.
c35177	And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada <i>was</i> over the host:
c35178	and Zadok and Abiathar <i>were</i> the priests:
c35179	And Azariah the son of Nathan <i>was</i> over the officers:
c35180	and Zabud the son of Nathan <i>was</i> principal officer, <i>and</i> the king's friend:
c35181	And Ahishar <i>was</i> over the household:
c35182	and Adoniram the son of Abda <i>was</i> over the tribute.
c35183	And Solomon had twelve
c35184	officers over all Israel,
c35185	which provided victuals for the king and his household:
c35186	each man his month in a year
c35187	made provision.
c35188	And these <i>are</i> their names:
c35189	The son of Hur, in mount Ephraim:
c35190	The son of Dekar, in Makaz, and in Shaalbim, and Bethshemesh, and Elonbethhanan:
c35191	The son of Hesed, in Aruboth;
c35192	to him <i>pertained</i> Sochoh, and all the land of Hepher:
c35193	The son of Abinadab, in all the region of Dor;
c35194	which had Taphath the daughter of Solomon to wife:
c35195	Baana the son of Ahilud; <i>to him pertained</i> Taanach and Megiddo, and all Bethshean,
c35196	which <i>is</i> by Zartanah
c35197	beneath Jezreel, from Bethshean to Abelmeholah, <i>even</i> unto <i>the place that is</i> beyond Jokneam:
c35198	The son of Geber, in Ramothgilead; to him <i>pertained</i> the towns of Jair the son of Manasseh,
c35200	which <i>are</i> in Gilead;
c35201	to him <i>also pertained</i> the region of Argob,
c35202	which <i>is</i> in Bashan,
c35203	threescore great cities with walls and brasen bars:
c35204	Ahinadab the son of Iddo <i>had</i> Mahanaim:
c35205	Ahimaaz <i>was</i> in Naphtali;
c35206	he also took Basmath the daughter of Solomon to wife:
c35207	Baanah the son of Hushai <i>was</i> in Asher and in Aloth:
c35208	Jehoshaphat the son of Paruah, in Issachar:
c35209	Shimei the son of Elah, in Benjamin:
c35210	Geber the son of Uri <i>was</i> in the country of Gilead, <i>in</i> the country of Sihon king of the Amorites, and of Og king of Bashan;
c35211	and <i>he was</i> the only officer
c35212	which <i>was</i> in the land.
c35213	Judah and Israel <i>were</i> many, as the sand
c35214	which <i>is</i> by the sea
c35215	in multitude,
c35216	eating
c35217	and drinking,
c35218	and making merry.
c35219	And Solomon
c35220	reigned over all kingdoms from the river unto the land of the Philistines, and unto the border of Egypt:
c35221	they brought presents,
c35222	and served Solomon all the days of his life.
c35223	And Solomon's provision for one day was thirty measures of fine flour, and threescore measures of meal,
c35224	Ten fat oxen, and twenty oxen out of the pastures, and an hundred sheep, beside harts, and roebucks, and fallowdeer, and fatted fowl.
c35225	For he had dominion over all <i>the region</i> on this side the river, from Tiphsah even to Azzah, over all the kings on this side the river:
c35226	and he had peace on all sides round about him.
c35227	And Judah and Israel dwelt safely,
c35228	every man under his vine and under his fig tree,
c35229	from Dan even to Beersheba, all the days of Solomon.
c35230	And Solomon had forty thousand stalls of horses for his chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen.
c35231	And those officers provided victual for king Solomon, and for all
c35232	that came unto king Solomon's table,
c35233	every man in his month:
c35234	they lacked nothing.
c35235	Barley also and straw for the horses and dromedaries brought they unto the place
c35236	where <i>the officers</i> were,
c35237	every man according to his charge.
c35238	And God gave Solomon wisdom
c35239	and understanding exceeding much, and largeness of heart, even as the sand
c35240	that <i>is</i> on the sea shore.
c35241	And Solomon's wisdom excelled the wisdom of all the children of the east country, and all the wisdom of Egypt.
c35242	For he was wiser than all men; than Ethan the Ezrahite, and Heman, and Chalcol, and Darda, the sons of Mahol:
c35243	and his fame was in all nations round about.
c35244	And he spake three thousand proverbs:
c35245	and his songs were a thousand and five.
c35246	And he spake of trees, from the cedar tree
c35247	that <i>is</i> in Lebanon
c35248	even unto the hyssop
c35249	that springeth out of the wall:
c35250	he spake also of beasts, and of fowl, and of creeping things, and of fishes.
c35251	And there came of all people
c35252	to hear the wisdom of Solomon,
c35253	from all kings of the earth,
c35254	which had heard of his wisdom.
c35255	And Hiram king of Tyre sent his servants unto Solomon;
c35256	for he had heard
c35257	that they had anointed him king in the room of his father:
c35258	for Hiram was
c35260	ever a lover of David.
c35261	And Solomon sent to Hiram,
c35262	saying,
c35263	Thou knowest how that David my father
c35264	could not
c35265	build an house unto the name of the LORD his God for the wars
c35266	which were about him on every side,
c35267	until the LORD put them under the soles of his feet.
c35268	But now the LORD my God hath given me rest on every side,
c35269	<i>so that there is</i> neither adversary
c35270	nor evil occurrent.
c35271	And, behold, I purpose
c35272	to build an house unto the name of the LORD my God,
c35273	as the LORD spake unto David my father,
c35274	saying,
c35275	Thy son,
c35276	whom I will set upon thy throne in thy room,
c35277	he shall build an house unto my name.
c35278	Now
c35279	therefore command
c35280	thou that they hew me cedar trees out of Lebanon;
c35281	and my servants shall be with thy servants:
c35282	and unto thee will I give hire for thy servants according to all
c35283	that thou shalt appoint:
c35284	for thou knowest
c35285	that <i>there is</i> not among us any
c35286	that can skill
c35287	to hew timber
c35288	like unto the Sidonians.
c35289	And it came to pass,
c35290	when Hiram heard the words of Solomon,
c35291	that he rejoiced greatly,
c35292	and said,
c35293	Blessed <i>be</i> the LORD this day,
c35294	which hath given unto David a wise son over this great people.
c35295	And Hiram sent to Solomon,
c35296	saying,
c35297	I have considered
c35298	the things which thou sentest to
c35299	me for: <i>and</i> I will do all thy desire concerning timber of cedar, and concerning timber of fir.
c35300	My servants shall bring <i>them</i> down from Lebanon unto the sea:
c35301	and I will convey them by sea in floats unto the place
c35302	that thou shalt appoint
c35303	me, and will cause them to be discharged there,
c35304	and thou shalt receive
c35305	<i>them:</i> and thou shalt accomplish my desire,
c35306	in giving food for my household.
c35308	So Hiram gave Solomon cedar trees and fir trees <i>according to</i> all his desire.
c35309	And Solomon gave Hiram twenty thousand measures of wheat <i>for</i> food to his household,
c35310	and twenty measures of pure oil:
c35311	thus gave Solomon to Hiram year by year.
c35312	And the LORD gave Solomon wisdom,
c35313	as he promised
c35314	him: and there was peace between Hiram and Solomon;
c35315	and they two made a league together.
c35316	And king Solomon raised a levy out of all Israel;
c35317	and the levy was thirty thousand men.
c35318	And he sent them to Lebanon,
c35319	ten thousand a month by courses:
c35320	a month they were in Lebanon,
c35321	<i>and</i> two months at home:
c35322	and Adoniram <i>was</i> over the levy.
c35323	And Solomon had threescore and ten thousand
c35324	that bare burdens,
c35325	and fourscore thousand
c35326	hewers in the mountains;
c35327	Beside the chief of Solomon's officers
c35328	which <i>were</i> over the work,
c35329	three thousand and three hundred,
c35330	which ruled over the people
c35331	that wrought in the work.
c35332	And the king commanded,
c35333	and they brought great stones, costly stones,
c35334	to lay the foundation of the house.
c35335	<i>and</i> hewed stones,
c35336	And Solomon's builders and Hiram's builders did hew <i>them,</i> and the stonesquarers:
c35337	so they prepared timber and stones
c35338	to build the house.
c35339	And it came to pass in the four hundred and eightieth year after the children of Israel were come out of the land of Egypt,
c35341	in the fourth year of Solomon's reign over Israel, in the month Zif,
c35342	which <i>is</i> the second month,
c35344	that he began to build the house of the LORD.
c35345	And the house
c35346	which king Solomon built for the LORD,
c35347	the length thereof <i>was</i> threescore cubits,
c35348	and the breadth thereof twenty
c35349	<i>cubits,</i> and the height thereof thirty cubits.
c35350	And the porch before the temple of the house,
c35351	twenty cubits <i>was</i> the length thereof, according to the breadth of the house;
c35352	<i>and</i> ten cubits <i>was</i> the breadth thereof before the house.
c35353	And for the house he made windows of narrow lights.
c35354	And against the wall of the house he built chambers round about,
c35355	<i>against</i> the walls of the house round about, <i>both</i> of the temple and of the oracle:
c35356	and he made chambers round about:
c35357	The nethermost chamber
c35358	<i>was</i> five cubits broad,
c35359	and the middle
c35360	<i>was</i> six cubits broad,
c35361	and the third
c35362	<i>was</i> seven cubits broad:
c35363	for without <i>in the wall</i> of the house he made narrowed rests round about,
c35364	that <i>the beams</i> should not be fastened in the walls of the house.
c35365	And the house,
c35366	when it was in building,
c35367	was built of stone made ready before it was brought
c35368	thither: so that there was neither hammer nor axe <i>nor</i> any tool of iron heard in the house,
c35369	while it was in building.
c35370	The door for the middle chamber <i>was</i> in the right side of the house:
c35371	and they went up with winding stairs into the middle
c35372	<i>chamber,</i> and out of the middle into the third.
c35373	So he built the house,
c35374	and finished
c35375	it; and covered the house with beams and boards of cedar.
c35376	And <i>then</i> he built chambers against all the house,
c35377	five cubits high:
c35378	and they rested on the house <i>with</i> timber of cedar.
c35379	And the word of the LORD came to Solomon,
c35380	saying,
c35381	<i>Concerning</i> this house
c35382	which thou art in building,
c35383	if thou wilt walk in my statutes,
c35384	and execute my judgments,
c35385	and keep all my commandments
c35386	to walk
c35387	in them; then will I perform my word with thee,
c35388	which I spake unto David thy father:
c35389	And I will dwell among the children of Israel,
c35390	and will not forsake my people Israel.
c35391	So Solomon built the house,
c35392	and finished it.
c35393	And he built the walls of the house within with boards of cedar,
c35394	both the floor of the house, and the walls of the cieling: <i>and</i> he covered <i>them</i> on the inside with wood,
c35395	and covered the floor of the house with planks of fir.
c35396	And he built twenty cubits on the sides of the house, both the floor and the walls with boards of cedar:
c35397	he even built <i>them</i> for it within, <i>even</i> for the oracle, <i>even</i> for the most holy <i>place.</i>
c35398	And the house, that <i>is,</i> the temple before it, was forty cubits <i>long.</i>
c35400	And the cedar of the house within
c35401	<i>was</i> carved with knops and open flowers:
c35402	all <i>was</i> cedar;
c35403	there was no stone seen.
c35404	And the oracle he prepared in the house within,
c35405	to set there the ark of the covenant of the LORD.
c35406	And the oracle in the forepart
c35407	<i>was</i> twenty cubits in length,
c35408	and twenty cubits in breadth,
c35409	and twenty cubits in the height
c35410	thereof: and he overlaid it with pure gold;
c35411	and <i>so</i> covered the altar <i>which was of</i> cedar.
c35412	So Solomon overlaid the house within with pure gold:
c35413	and he made a partition by the chains of gold before the oracle;
c35414	and he overlaid it with gold.
c35415	And the whole house he overlaid with gold,
c35416	until he had finished all the house:
c35417	also the whole altar
c35418	that <i>was</i> by the oracle
c35419	he overlaid with gold.
c35420	And within the oracle he made two cherubims <i>of</i> olive tree,
c35421	<i>each</i> ten cubits high.
c35422	And five cubits <i>was</i> the one wing of the cherub,
c35423	and five cubits the other wing of the cherub:
c35424	from the uttermost part of the one wing unto the uttermost part of the other <i>were</i> ten cubits.
c35425	And the other cherub <i>was</i> ten cubits:
c35426	both the cherubims <i>were</i> of one measure and one size.
c35427	The height of the one cherub <i>was</i> ten cubits,
c35428	and so <i>was it</i> of the other cherub.
c35429	And he set the cherubims within the inner house:
c35430	and they stretched forth the wings of the cherubims,
c35431	so that the wing of the one touched the <i>one</i> wall,
c35432	and the wing of the other cherub touched the other wall;
c35433	and their wings touched one another in the midst of the house.
c35434	And he overlaid the cherubims with gold.
c35435	And he carved all the walls of the house round about with carved figures of cherubims and palm trees and open flowers, within and without.
c35436	And the floor of the house he overlaid with gold, within and without.
c35437	And for the entering of the oracle he made doors <i>of</i> olive tree:
c35438	the lintel <i>and</i> side posts <i>were</i> a fifth part <i>of the wall.</i>
c35439	The two doors also <i>were of</i> olive tree;
c35440	and he carved upon them carvings of cherubims and palm trees and open flowers,
c35441	and overlaid <i>them</i> with gold,
c35442	and spread gold upon the cherubims, and upon the palm trees.
c35443	So also made he for the door of the temple posts <i>of</i> olive tree, a fourth part <i>of the wall.</i>
c35444	And the two doors <i>were of</i> fir tree:
c35445	the two leaves of the one door <i>were</i> folding,
c35446	and the two leaves of the other door <i>were</i> folding.
c35447	And he carved <i>thereon</i> cherubims and palm trees and open flowers:
c35448	and covered <i>them</i> with gold
c35449	fitted upon the carved work.
c35450	And he built the inner court with three rows of hewed stone, and a row of cedar beams.
c35451	In the fourth year was the foundation of the house of the LORD laid, in the month Zif:
c35452	And in the eleventh year, in the month Bul,
c35453	which <i>is</i> the eighth month,
c35454	was the house finished throughout all the parts thereof, and according to all the fashion
c35455	of it. So was he seven years in building it.
c35456	But Solomon was building his own house thirteen years,
c35457	and he finished all his house.
c35458	He built also the house of the forest of Lebanon;
c35459	the length thereof <i>was</i> an hundred cubits,
c35460	and the breadth thereof fifty cubits,
c35461	and the height thereof thirty cubits,
c35462	upon four rows of cedar pillars,
c35463	with cedar beams upon the pillars.
c35464	And <i>it was</i> covered with cedar above upon the beams,
c35465	that <i>lay</i> on forty five pillars,
c35467	fifteen <i>in</i> a row.
c35468	And <i>there were</i> windows <i>in</i> three rows,
c35469	and light <i>was</i> against light <i>in</i> three ranks.
c35470	And all the doors and posts <i>were</i> square, with the windows: and light <i>was</i> against light <i>in</i> three ranks.
c35471	And he made a porch of pillars;
c35472	the length thereof <i>was</i> fifty cubits,
c35473	and the breadth thereof thirty cubits:
c35474	and the porch <i>was</i> before
c35475	them: and the <i>other</i> pillars and the thick beam <i>were</i> before them.
c35477	where he might judge, <i>even</i> the porch of judgment:
c35478	Then he made a porch for the throne
c35479	and <i>it was</i> covered with cedar from one side of the floor to the other.
c35480	And his house
c35481	where he dwelt
c35482	<i>had</i> another court within the porch,
c35483	<i>which</i> was of the like work.
c35485	Solomon made also an house for Pharaoh's daughter, whom he had taken
c35486	<i>to wife,</i> like unto this porch.
c35487	All these <i>were of</i> costly stones, according to the measures of hewed stones,
c35488	sawed with saws,
c35489	within and without, even from the foundation unto the coping, and <i>so</i> on the outside toward the great court.
c35490	And the foundation <i>was of</i> costly stones, even great stones, stones of ten cubits, and stones of eight cubits.
c35491	And above <i>were</i> costly stones, after the measures of hewed stones, and cedars.
c35492	And the great court round about <i>was</i> with three rows of hewed stones,
c35493	and a row of cedar beams,
c35494	both for the inner court of the house of the LORD, and for the porch of the house.
c35495	And king Solomon sent
c35496	and fetched Hiram out of Tyre.
c35497	He <i>was</i> a widow's son of the tribe of Naphtali,
c35498	and his father <i>was</i> a man of Tyre,
c35499	a worker in brass:
c35500	and he was filled with wisdom, and understanding, and cunning
c35501	to work all works in brass.
c35502	And he came to king Solomon,
c35503	and wrought all his work.
c35504	For he cast two pillars of brass,
c35505	of eighteen cubits high apiece:
c35506	and a line of twelve cubits did compass either of them about.
c35507	And he made two chapiters
c35508	to set upon the tops of the pillars:
c35509	<i>of</i> molten brass,
c35510	the height of the one chapiter <i>was</i> five cubits,
c35511	and the height of the other chapiter <i>was</i> five cubits:
c35512	<i>And</i> nets of checker work,
c35513	and wreaths of chain work, for the chapiters
c35514	which <i>were</i> upon the top of the pillars;
c35515	seven for the one chapiter,
c35516	and seven for the other chapiter.
c35517	And he made the pillars, and two rows round about upon the one network,
c35518	to cover the chapiters
c35519	that <i>were</i> upon the top, with pomegranates:
c35520	and so did he for the other chapiter.
c35521	And the chapiters
c35522	that <i>were</i> upon the top of the pillars
c35523	<i>were</i> of lily work in the porch, four cubits.
c35524	And the chapiters upon the two pillars <i>had pomegranates</i> also above, over against the belly
c35525	which <i>was</i> by the network:
c35526	and the pomegranates <i>were</i> two hundred in rows round about upon the other chapiter.
c35527	And he set up the pillars in the porch of the temple:
c35528	and he set up the right pillar,
c35529	and called the name thereof Jachin:
c35530	and he set up the left pillar,
c35531	and called the name thereof Boaz.
c35532	And upon the top of the pillars <i>was</i> lily work:
c35533	so was the work of the pillars finished.
c35534	And he made a molten sea,
c35536	ten cubits from the one brim to the other:
c35537	<i>it was</i> round all about,
c35538	and his height <i>was</i> five cubits:
c35539	and a line of thirty cubits did compass it round about.
c35540	And under the brim of it round about <i>there were</i> knops compassing
c35541	it, ten in a cubit,
c35542	compassing the sea round about:
c35543	the knops <i>were</i> cast in two rows, when it was cast.
c35544	It stood upon twelve oxen,
c35545	three looking toward the north,
c35546	and three looking toward the west,
c35547	and three looking toward the south,
c35548	and three looking toward the east:
c35549	and the sea <i>was set</i> above upon
c35550	them, and all their hinder parts <i>were</i> inward.
c35551	And it <i>was</i> an hand breadth thick,
c35552	and the brim thereof was wrought like the brim of a cup, with flowers of lilies:
c35553	it contained two thousand baths.
c35554	And he made ten bases of brass;
c35555	four cubits <i>was</i> the length of one base,
c35556	and four cubits the breadth
c35557	thereof, and three cubits the height of it.
c35558	And the work of the bases <i>was</i> on this
c35559	<i>manner:</i> they had borders,
c35560	and the borders <i>were</i> between the ledges:
c35561	And on the borders
c35562	that <i>were</i> between the ledges
c35563	<i>were</i> lions, oxen, and cherubims:
c35564	and upon the ledges <i>there was</i> a base above:
c35565	and beneath the lions and oxen <i>were</i> certain additions made of thin work.
c35566	And every base had four brasen wheels, and plates of brass:
c35567	and the four corners
c35568	thereof had undersetters:
c35569	under the laver <i>were</i> undersetters molten,
c35570	at the side of every addition.
c35571	And the mouth of it within the chapiter and above <i>was</i> a cubit:
c35572	but the mouth thereof <i>was</i> round
c35573	<i>after</i> the work of the base, a cubit and an half:
c35574	and also upon the mouth of it <i>were</i> gravings with their borders,
c35575	foursquare,
c35576	not round.
c35577	And under the borders <i>were</i> four wheels;
c35578	and the axletrees of the wheels <i>were joined</i> to the base:
c35579	and the height of a wheel <i>was</i> a cubit and half a cubit.
c35580	And the work of the wheels <i>was</i> like the work of a chariot wheel:
c35581	their axletrees, and their naves, and their felloes, and their spokes,
c35582	<i>were</i> all molten.
c35583	And <i>there were</i> four undersetters to the four corners of one base:
c35584	<i>and</i> the undersetters <i>were</i> of the very base itself.
c35585	And in the top of the base
c35586	of half a cubit high:
c35587	<i>was there</i> a round compass
c35588	and on the top of the base the ledges thereof and the borders thereof <i>were</i> of the same.
c35589	For on the plates of the ledges thereof, and on the borders thereof, he graved cherubims, lions, and palm trees, according to the proportion of every one,
c35590	and additions round about.
c35591	After this <i>manner</i> he made the ten bases:
c35592	all of them had one casting, one measure, <i>and</i> one size.
c35593	Then made he ten lavers of brass:
c35594	one laver contained forty baths:
c35595	<i>and</i> every laver was four cubits:
c35596	<i>and</i> upon every one of the ten bases one laver.
c35597	And he put five bases
c35598	on the right side of the house,
c35599	and five on the left side of the house:
c35600	and he set the sea on the right side of the house eastward over against the south.
c35601	And Hiram made the lavers, and the shovels, and the basons.
c35602	So Hiram made an end
c35603	of doing all the work
c35604	that he made king Solomon for the house of the LORD:
c35605	The two pillars, and the <i>two</i> bowls of the chapiters
c35606	that <i>were</i> on the top of the two pillars;
c35607	and the two networks,
c35608	to cover the two bowls of the chapiters
c35609	which <i>were</i> upon the top of the pillars;
c35610	And four hundred pomegranates for the two networks,
c35611	<i>even</i> two rows of pomegranates for one network,
c35612	to cover the two bowls of the chapiters
c35613	that <i>were</i> upon the pillars;
c35614	And the ten bases, and ten lavers on the bases;
c35615	And one sea, and twelve oxen under the sea;
c35616	And the pots, and the shovels, and the basons:
c35617	and all these vessels,
c35618	which Hiram made to king Solomon for the house of the LORD,
c35619	<i>were of</i> bright brass.
c35620	In the plain of Jordan did the king cast them, in the clay ground between Succoth and Zarthan.
c35621	And Solomon left all the vessels <i>unweighed,</i> because they were exceeding many:
c35622	neither was the weight of the brass found out.
c35623	And Solomon made all the vessels
c35624	that <i>pertained</i> unto the house of the LORD:
c35625	the altar of gold, and the table
c35626	whereupon the shewbread <i>was,</i>
c35627	of gold,
c35628	And the candlesticks
c35629	five on the right
c35630	<i>side,</i> and five on the left, before the oracle,
c35631	of pure gold,
c35632	with the flowers, and the lamps, and the tongs <i>of</i> gold,
c35633	And the bowls, and the snuffers, and the basons, and the spoons, and the censers <i>of</i> pure gold;
c35634	and the hinges <i>of</i> gold, <i>both</i> for the doors of the inner house, the most holy <i>place, and</i> for the doors of the house, <i>to wit,</i> of the temple.
c35635	So was ended all the work
c35636	that king Solomon made for the house of the LORD.
c35637	And Solomon brought in the things which David his father had dedicated;
c35638	<i>even</i> the silver, and the gold, and the vessels, did he put among the treasures of the house of the LORD.
c35639	Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel, and all the heads of the tribes, the chief of the fathers of the children of Israel, unto king Solomon in Jerusalem,
c35640	that they might bring up the ark of the covenant of the LORD out of the city of David,
c35641	which <i>is</i> Zion.
c35642	And all the men of Israel assembled themselves unto king Solomon at the feast in the month Ethanim,
c35643	which <i>is</i> the seventh month.
c35644	And all the elders of Israel came,
c35645	and the priests took up the ark.
c35646	And they brought up the ark of the LORD, and the tabernacle of the congregation, and all the holy vessels
c35647	that <i>were</i> in the tabernacle,
c35648	even those did the priests and the Levites bring up.
c35649	And king Solomon, and all the congregation of Israel,
c35650	that were assembled unto
c35651	him, <i>were</i> with him before the ark,
c35652	sacrificing sheep and oxen,
c35653	that could not be told
c35654	nor numbered for multitude.
c35655	And the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of the LORD unto his place, into the oracle of the house, to the most holy <i>place, even</i> under the wings of the cherubims.
c35656	For the cherubims spread forth <i>their</i> two wings over the place of the ark,
c35657	and the cherubims covered the ark and the staves thereof above.
c35658	And they drew out the staves,
c35659	that the ends of the staves were seen out in the holy <i>place</i> before the oracle,
c35660	and they were not seen without:
c35661	and there they are unto this day.
c35662	<i>There was</i> nothing in the ark
c35663	save the two tables of stone,
c35664	which Moses put there at Horeb,
c35665	when the LORD made <i>a covenant</i> with the children of Israel,
c35666	when they came out of the land of Egypt.
c35667	And it came to pass,
c35668	when the priests were come out of the holy
c35669	<i>place,</i> that the cloud filled the house of the LORD,
c35670	So that the priests could not
c35671	stand
c35672	to minister
c35673	because of the cloud:
c35674	for the glory of the LORD had filled the house of the LORD.
c35675	Then spake Solomon,
c35676	The LORD said
c35677	that he would dwell in the thick darkness.
c35678	I have surely built thee an house to dwell in,
c35679	a settled place
c35680	for thee to abide in for ever.
c35681	And the king turned his face
c35682	about, and blessed all the congregation of Israel:
c35683	(and all the congregation of Israel stood;)
c35684	And he said,
c35685	Blessed <i>be</i> the LORD God of Israel,
c35686	which spake with his mouth unto David my father,
c35687	and hath with his hand fulfilled
c35688	<i>it,</i> saying,
c35689	Since the day
c35690	that I brought forth my people Israel out of Egypt,
c35691	I chose no city out of all the tribes of Israel
c35692	to build an house,
c35693	that my name might be therein;
c35694	but I chose David
c35695	to be over my people Israel.
c35696	And it was in the heart of David my father
c35697	to build an house for the name of the LORD God of Israel.
c35698	And the LORD said unto David my father,
c35699	Whereas it was in thine heart
c35700	to build an house unto my name,
c35701	thou didst well
c35702	that it was in thine heart.
c35703	Nevertheless thou shalt not build the house;
c35704	but thy son
c35705	that shall come forth out of thy loins,
c35706	he shall build the house unto my name.
c35707	And the LORD hath performed his word
c35708	that he spake,
c35709	and I am risen up in the room of David my father,
c35710	and sit on the throne of Israel,
c35711	as the LORD promised,
c35712	and have built an house for the name of the LORD God of Israel.
c35713	And I have set there a place for the ark,
c35714	wherein <i>is</i> the covenant of the LORD,
c35715	which he made with our fathers,
c35716	when he brought them out of the land of Egypt.
c35717	And Solomon stood before the altar of the LORD in the presence of all the congregation of Israel,
c35718	and spread forth his hands toward heaven:
c35719	And he said,
c35720	LORD God of Israel,
c35721	<i>there is</i> no God like thee, in heaven above, or on earth beneath,
c35722	who keepest covenant and mercy with thy servants
c35723	that walk before thee with all their heart:
c35724	Who hast kept with thy servant David my father
c35725	that thou promisedst
c35726	him: thou spakest also with thy mouth,
c35727	and hast fulfilled <i>it</i> with thine hand,
c35728	as <i>it is</i> this day.
c35729	Therefore now,
c35730	LORD God of Israel,
c35731	keep with thy servant David my father
c35732	that thou promisedst
c35733	him, saying,
c35734	There shall not fail thee a man in my sight
c35735	to sit on the throne of Israel;
c35736	so that thy children take heed to their way,
c35737	that they walk before
c35738	me as thou hast walked before me.
c35739	And now,
c35740	O God of Israel,
c35741	let thy word, I pray thee, be verified,
c35742	which thou spakest unto thy servant David my father.
c35743	But
c35744	will God indeed dwell on the earth?
c35745	behold, the heaven and heaven of heavens cannot contain
c35746	thee; how much less this house
c35747	that I have builded?
c35748	Yet have thou respect unto the prayer of thy servant, and to his supplication,
c35749	O LORD my God,
c35750	to hearken unto the cry and to the prayer,
c35751	which thy servant prayeth before thee to day:
c35752	That thine eyes may be open toward this house night and day,
c35753	<i>even</i> toward the place
c35754	of which thou hast said,
c35755	My name shall be there:
c35756	that thou mayest hearken unto the prayer
c35757	which thy servant shall make toward this place.
c35758	And hearken thou to the supplication of thy servant, and of thy people Israel,
c35759	when they shall pray toward this place:
c35760	and hear thou in heaven thy dwelling place:
c35761	and when thou hearest,
c35762	forgive.
c35763	If any man trespass against his neighbour,
c35764	and an oath be laid
c35765	upon him to cause him to swear,
c35766	and the oath come before thine altar in this house:
c35767	Then hear thou in heaven,
c35768	and do,
c35769	and judge thy servants,
c35770	condemning the wicked,
c35771	to bring his way upon his head;
c35772	and justifying the righteous,
c35773	to give him according to his righteousness.
c35774	When thy people Israel be smitten down before the enemy,
c35775	because they have sinned
c35776	against thee, and shall turn again to
c35777	thee, and confess thy name,
c35778	and pray,
c35779	and make supplication unto thee in this house:
c35780	Then hear thou in heaven,
c35781	and forgive the sin of thy people Israel,
c35782	and bring them again unto the land
c35783	which thou gavest unto their fathers.
c35784	When heaven is shut up,
c35785	and there is no rain,
c35786	because they have sinned
c35787	against thee; if they pray toward this place,
c35788	and confess thy name,
c35789	and turn from their sin,
c35790	when thou afflictest them:
c35791	Then hear thou in heaven,
c35792	and forgive the sin of thy servants, and of thy people Israel,
c35793	that thou teach them the good way
c35794	wherein they should walk,
c35795	and give rain upon thy land,
c35796	which thou hast given to thy people for an inheritance.
c35797	famine,
c35798	If there be in the land
c35799	pestilence,
c35800	if there be
c35801	blasting, mildew, locust, <i>or</i> if there be caterpiller;
c35803	if their enemy besiege them in the land of their cities;
c35804	whatsoever plague, whatsoever sickness <i>there be;</i>
c35805	What prayer and supplication soever
c35806	be <i>made</i> by any man, <i>or</i> by all thy people Israel,
c35807	which shall know
c35808	every man the plague of his own heart,
c35809	and spread forth his hands toward this house:
c35810	Then hear thou in heaven thy dwelling place,
c35811	and forgive,
c35812	and do,
c35813	and give to every man according to his ways,
c35814	whose heart thou knowest;
c35815	(for thou, <i>even</i> thou only, knowest the hearts of all the children of men;)
c35816	That they may fear thee all the days
c35817	that they live in the land
c35818	which thou gavest unto our fathers.
c35819	Moreover concerning a stranger,
c35820	that <i>is</i> not of thy people Israel,
c35821	but cometh out of a far country for thy name's sake;
c35822	(For they shall hear of thy great name, and of thy strong hand, and of thy stretched out arm;)
c35823	when he shall come
c35824	and pray toward this house;
c35825	Hear thou in heaven thy dwelling place,
c35826	and do according to all
c35827	that the stranger calleth to
c35828	thee for: that all people of the earth may know thy name,
c35829	to fear thee, as <i>do</i> thy people Israel;
c35830	and that they may know
c35831	that this house, which I have builded, is called by thy name.
c35833	If thy people go out to battle against their enemy, whithersoever
c35834	thou shalt send
c35835	them, and shall pray unto the LORD toward the city
c35836	which thou hast chosen,
c35837	and <i>toward</i> the house
c35838	that I have built for thy name:
c35839	Then hear thou in heaven their prayer and their supplication,
c35840	and maintain their cause.
c35841	If they sin
c35842	against thee, (for <i>there is</i> no man
c35843	that sinneth not,)
c35844	and thou be angry
c35845	with them, and deliver them to the enemy,
c35846	so that they carry them away captives unto the land of the enemy, far or near;
c35847	<i>Yet</i> if they shall bethink themselves in the land
c35848	whither they were carried captives,
c35849	and repent,
c35850	and make supplication unto thee in the land of them that carried them captives,
c35851	saying,
c35852	We have sinned,
c35853	and have done perversely,
c35854	we have committed wickedness;
c35855	And <i>so</i> return unto thee with all their heart, and with all their soul, in the land of their enemies,
c35856	which led them away captive,
c35857	and pray unto thee toward their land,
c35858	which thou gavest unto their fathers,
c35859	the city
c35860	which thou hast chosen,
c35861	and the house
c35862	which I have built for thy name:
c35863	Then hear thou their prayer and their supplication in heaven thy dwelling place,
c35864	and maintain their cause,
c35865	And forgive thy people
c35866	that have sinned
c35867	against thee, and all their transgressions
c35868	wherein they have transgressed
c35869	against thee, and give them compassion before them who carried them captive,
c35870	that they may have compassion on them:
c35871	For they <i>be</i> thy people, and thine inheritance,
c35872	which thou broughtest forth out of Egypt, from the midst of the furnace of iron:
c35873	That thine eyes may be open unto the supplication of thy servant, and unto the supplication of thy people Israel,
c35874	to hearken unto them in all
c35875	that they call for unto thee.
c35876	For thou didst separate them from among all the people of the earth, <i>to be</i> thine inheritance,
c35877	as thou spakest by the hand of Moses thy servant,
c35878	when thou broughtest our fathers out of Egypt,
c35879	O Lord GOD.
c35880	And it was
c35881	<i>so,</i> that when Solomon had made an end
c35882	of praying all this prayer and supplication unto the LORD,
c35883	he arose from before the altar of the LORD,
c35884	from kneeling on his knees
c35885	with his hands spread up to heaven.
c35886	And he stood,
c35887	and blessed all the congregation of Israel with a loud voice,
c35888	saying,
c35889	Blessed <i>be</i> the LORD,
c35890	that hath given rest unto his people Israel, according to all
c35891	that he promised:
c35892	there hath not failed one word of all his good promise,
c35893	which he promised by the hand of Moses his servant.
c35894	The LORD our God be with
c35895	us, as he was with our fathers:
c35896	let him not leave
c35897	us, nor forsake us:
c35898	That he may incline our hearts unto
c35899	him, to walk in all his ways,
c35900	and to keep his commandments, and his statutes, and his judgments,
c35901	which he commanded our fathers.
c35902	And let these my words, wherewith I have made supplication before the LORD, be
c35904	nigh unto the LORD our God day and night,
c35905	that he maintain the cause of his servant, and the cause of his people Israel at all times, as the matter shall require:
c35906	That all the people of the earth may know
c35907	that the LORD
c35908	<i>is</i> God,
c35909	<i>and that there is</i> none else.
c35910	Let your heart therefore be perfect with the LORD our God,
c35911	to walk in his statutes,
c35912	and to keep his commandments,
c35913	as at this day.
c35914	And the king, and all Israel with him, offered sacrifice before the LORD.
c35915	And Solomon offered a sacrifice of peace offerings,
c35916	which he offered unto the LORD,
c35917	two and twenty thousand oxen, and an hundred and twenty thousand sheep.
c35918	So the king and all the children of Israel dedicated the house of the LORD.
c35919	The same day did the king hallow the middle of the court
c35920	that <i>was</i> before the house of the LORD:
c35921	for there he offered burnt offerings, and meat offerings, and the fat of the peace offerings:
c35922	because the brasen altar
c35923	that <i>was</i> before the LORD
c35924	<i>was</i> too little
c35925	to receive the burnt offerings, and meat offerings, and the fat of the peace offerings.
c35926	And at that time Solomon held a feast,
c35927	and all Israel with
c35928	him, a great congregation,
c35929	from the entering in of Hamath
c35930	unto the river of Egypt,
c35931	before the LORD our God, seven days and seven days, <i>even</i> fourteen days.
c35932	On the eighth day he sent the people
c35933	away: and they blessed the king,
c35934	and went unto their tents
c35935	joyful and glad of heart for all the goodness
c35936	that the LORD had done for David his servant, and for Israel his people.
c35937	And it came to pass,
c35938	when Solomon had finished
c35939	the building of the house of the LORD, and the king's house, and all Solomon's desire
c35940	which he was pleased
c35941	to do,
c35942	That the LORD appeared to Solomon the second time,
c35943	as he had appeared unto him at Gibeon.
c35944	And the LORD said unto
c35945	him, I have heard thy prayer and thy supplication,
c35946	that thou hast made before
c35947	me: I have hallowed this house,
c35948	which thou hast built,
c35949	to put my name there for ever;
c35950	and mine eyes and mine heart shall be there perpetually.
c35952	And if thou wilt walk before
c35953	me, as David thy father walked, in integrity of heart, and in uprightness,
c35954	to do according to all
c35955	that I have commanded
c35956	thee, <i>and</i> wilt keep my statutes and my judgments:
c35957	Then I will establish the throne of thy kingdom upon Israel for ever,
c35958	as I promised to David thy father,
c35959	saying,
c35960	There shall not fail thee a man upon the throne of Israel.
c35961	<i>But</i> if ye shall at all turn from following me, ye or your children,
c35962	and will not keep my commandments <i>and</i> my statutes
c35963	which I have set before
c35964	you, but go
c35965	and serve other gods,
c35966	and worship them:
c35967	Then will I cut off Israel out of the land
c35968	which I have given
c35969	them; and this house,
c35970	which I have hallowed for my name,
c35971	will I cast out of my sight;
c35972	and Israel shall be a proverb and a byword among all people:
c35973	And at this house, <i>which</i> is high,
c35974	every one
c35975	that passeth by
c35976	it shall be astonished,
c35977	and shall hiss;
c35978	and they shall say,
c35979	Why hath the LORD done thus unto this land, and to this house?
c35980	And they shall answer,
c35981	Because they forsook the LORD their God,
c35982	who brought forth their fathers out of the land of Egypt,
c35983	and have taken hold upon other gods,
c35984	and have worshipped
c35985	them, and served
c35986	them: therefore hath the LORD brought upon them all this evil.
c35987	And it came to pass at the end of twenty years,
c35988	when Solomon had built the two houses, the house of the LORD, and the king's house,
c35989	<i>(Now</i> Hiram the king of Tyre had furnished Solomon with cedar trees and fir trees, and with gold, according to all his desire,)
c35990	that then king Solomon gave Hiram twenty cities in the land of Galilee.
c35991	And Hiram came out from Tyre
c35992	to see the cities
c35993	which Solomon had given
c35994	him; and they pleased him not.
c35995	And he said,
c35996	What cities <i>are</i> these
c35997	which thou hast given
c35998	me, my brother?
c35999	And he called them the land of Cabul unto this day.
c36000	And Hiram sent to the king sixscore talents of gold.
c36001	And this <i>is</i> the reason of the levy
c36002	which king Solomon raised;
c36003	for to build the house of the LORD, and his own house, and Millo, and the wall of Jerusalem, and Hazor, and Megiddo, and Gezer.
c36004	<i>For</i> Pharaoh king of Egypt had gone up,
c36005	and taken Gezer,
c36006	and burnt it with fire,
c36007	the Canaanites
c36008	that dwelt in the city,
c36009	and slain
c36010	and given it <i>for</i> a present unto his daughter, Solomon's wife.
c36011	And Solomon built Gezer, and Bethhoron the nether,
c36012	And Baalath, and Tadmor in the wilderness, in the land,
c36013	And all the cities of store
c36014	that Solomon had,
c36015	and cities for his chariots, and cities for his horsemen,
c36017	and that which Solomon desired
c36018	to build in Jerusalem, and in Lebanon, and in all the land of his dominion.
c36019	<i>And</i> all the people
c36020	<i>that were</i> left of the Amorites, Hittites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites,
c36021	which <i>were</i> not of the children of Israel,
c36022	Their children
c36023	that were left after them in the land,
c36024	whom the children of Israel also were not able
c36025	utterly to destroy,
c36026	upon those did Solomon levy a tribute of bondservice unto this day.
c36027	But of the children of Israel did Solomon make no bondmen:
c36028	but they <i>were</i> men of war, and his servants, and his princes, and his captains, and rulers of his chariots, and his horsemen.
c36029	These <i>were</i> the chief of the officers
c36030	that <i>were</i> over Solomon's work,
c36031	five hundred and fifty,
c36032	which bare rule over the people
c36033	that wrought in the work.
c36034	But Pharaoh's daughter came up out of the city of David unto her house
c36035	which <i>Solomon</i> had built
c36036	for her: then did he build Millo.
c36037	And three times in a year did Solomon offer burnt offerings and peace offerings upon the altar
c36038	which he built unto the LORD,
c36039	and he burnt incense upon
c36040	the altar that <i>was</i> before the LORD.
c36041	So he finished the house.
c36042	And king Solomon made a navy of ships in Eziongeber,
c36043	which <i>is</i> beside Eloth, on the shore of the Red sea, in the land of Edom.
c36044	And Hiram sent in the navy his servants, shipmen that had knowledge of the sea, with the servants of Solomon.
c36045	And they came to Ophir,
c36046	and fetched from thence gold, four hundred and twenty talents,
c36047	and brought <i>it</i> to king Solomon.
c36048	And when the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon concerning the name of the LORD,
c36049	she came
c36050	to prove him with hard questions.
c36051	And she came to Jerusalem with a very great train,
c36052	with camels that bare spices, and very much gold, and precious stones:
c36053	and when she was come to Solomon,
c36054	she communed with him of all
c36055	that was in her heart.
c36056	And Solomon told her all her questions:
c36057	there was not <i>any</i> thing hid from the king,
c36058	which he told her not.
c36059	And when the queen of Sheba had seen all Solomon's wisdom, and the house
c36060	that he had built,
c36061	And the meat of his table, and the sitting of his servants, and the attendance of his ministers, and their apparel, and his cupbearers, and his ascent
c36062	by which he went up unto the house of the LORD;
c36063	there was no more spirit in her.
c36064	And she said to the king,
c36065	It was a true report
c36066	that I heard in mine own land of thy acts and of thy wisdom.
c36067	Howbeit I believed not the words,
c36068	until I came,
c36069	and mine eyes had seen
c36070	<i>it:</i> and, behold,
c36071	the half was not told
c36072	me: thy wisdom and prosperity exceedeth the fame
c36073	which I heard.
c36074	Happy <i>are</i> thy men,
c36075	happy <i>are</i> these thy servants,
c36076	which stand continually before
c36077	thee, <i>and</i> that hear thy wisdom.
c36078	Blessed be the LORD thy God,
c36079	which delighted
c36080	in thee, to set thee on the throne of Israel:
c36081	because the LORD loved Israel for ever,
c36082	therefore made he thee king,
c36083	to do judgment and justice.
c36084	And she gave the king an hundred and twenty talents of gold, and of spices very great store, and precious stones:
c36085	there came no more such abundance of spices
c36086	as these which the queen of Sheba gave to king Solomon.
c36087	And the navy also of Hiram,
c36088	that brought gold from Ophir,
c36089	brought in from Ophir great plenty of almug trees, and precious stones.
c36090	And the king made of the almug trees pillars for the house of the LORD, and for the king's house, harps also and psalteries for singers:
c36091	there came no such almug trees,
c36092	nor were seen unto this day.
c36093	And king Solomon gave unto the queen of Sheba all her desire,
c36094	whatsoever she asked,
c36095	beside
c36096	<i>that</i> which Solomon gave her of his royal bounty.
c36097	So she turned
c36098	and went to her own country, she and her servants.
c36099	Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was
c36101	six hundred threescore and six talents of gold,
c36102	Beside <i>that he had</i> of the merchantmen, and of the traffick of the spice merchants, and of all the kings of Arabia, and of the governors of the country.
c36103	And king Solomon made two hundred targets <i>of</i> beaten gold:
c36104	six hundred <i>shekels</i> of gold went to one target.
c36105	And <i>he made</i> three hundred shields <i>of</i> beaten gold;
c36106	three pound of gold went to one shield:
c36107	and the king put them in the house of the forest of Lebanon.
c36108	Moreover the king made a great throne of ivory,
c36109	and overlaid it with the best gold.
c36110	The throne had six steps,
c36111	and the top of the throne <i>was</i> round behind:
c36112	and <i>there were</i> stays on either side on the place of the seat,
c36113	and two lions stood beside the stays.
c36114	And twelve lions stood there on the one side and on the other upon the six steps:
c36115	there was not the like made in any kingdom.
c36116	And all king Solomon's drinking vessels <i>were of</i> gold,
c36117	and all the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon <i>were of</i> pure gold;
c36118	none <i>were of</i> silver:
c36119	it was nothing accounted of in the days of Solomon.
c36120	For the king had at sea a navy of Tharshish with the navy of Hiram:
c36121	once in three years came the navy of Tharshish,
c36122	bringing gold, and silver, ivory, and apes, and peacocks.
c36123	So king Solomon exceeded all the kings of the earth for riches and for wisdom.
c36124	And all the earth sought to Solomon,
c36125	to hear his wisdom,
c36126	which God had put in his heart.
c36127	And they brought
c36128	every man his present,
c36129	vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and garments, and armour, and spices, horses, and mules, a rate year by year.
c36130	And Solomon gathered together chariots and horsemen:
c36131	and he had a thousand and four hundred chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen,
c36132	whom he bestowed in the cities for chariots, and with the king at Jerusalem.
c36133	And the king made silver <i>to be</i> in Jerusalem as stones,
c36134	and cedars made he <i>to be</i> as the sycomore trees
c36135	that <i>are</i> in the vale, for abundance.
c36136	had horses brought
c36137	And Solomon
c36138	out of Egypt,
c36139	and linen yarn:
c36140	the king's merchants received the linen yarn at a price.
c36142	And a chariot came up and went out of Egypt for six hundred <i>shekels</i> of silver,
c36143	and an horse for an hundred and fifty:
c36144	and so for all the kings of the Hittites, and for the kings of Syria, did they bring <i>them</i> out by their means.
c36145	But king Solomon loved many strange women, together with the daughter of Pharaoh, women of the Moabites, Ammonites, Edomites, Zidonians, <i>and</i> Hittites;
c36146	Of the nations
c36147	<i>concerning</i> which the LORD said unto the children of Israel,
c36148	Ye shall not go in
c36149	to them, neither shall they come in
c36150	unto you: <i>for</i> surely they will turn away your heart after their gods:
c36151	Solomon clave unto these in love.
c36152	And he had seven hundred wives, princesses, and three hundred concubines:
c36153	and his wives turned away his heart.
c36154	For it came to pass, when Solomon was old,
c36155	<i>that</i> his wives turned away his heart after other gods:
c36156	and his heart was not perfect with the LORD his God, as <i>was</i> the heart of David his father.
c36157	For Solomon went after Ashtoreth the goddess of the Zidonians, and after Milcom the abomination of the Ammonites.
c36158	And Solomon did
c36159	evil in the sight of the LORD,
c36160	and went not fully after the LORD, as <i>did</i> David his father.
c36161	Then did Solomon build an high place for Chemosh, the abomination of Moab, in the hill
c36162	that <i>is</i> before Jerusalem,
c36163	and for Molech, the abomination of the children of Ammon.
c36164	And likewise did he for all his strange wives,
c36165	which burnt incense
c36166	and sacrificed unto their gods.
c36167	And the LORD was angry with Solomon,
c36168	because his heart was turned from the LORD God of Israel,
c36169	which had appeared unto him twice,
c36170	And had commanded him concerning this thing,
c36171	that he should not go after other gods:
c36172	but he kept not
c36173	that which the LORD commanded.
c36174	Wherefore the LORD said unto Solomon,
c36175	Forasmuch as this is done of
c36176	thee, and thou hast not kept my covenant and my statutes,
c36177	which I have commanded
c36178	thee, I will surely rend the kingdom from
c36179	thee, and will give it to thy servant.
c36180	Notwithstanding in thy days I will not do it for David thy father's sake:
c36181	<i>but</i> I will rend it out of the hand of thy son.
c36182	Howbeit I will not rend away all the kingdom;
c36183	<i>but</i> will give one tribe to thy son for David my servant's sake, and for Jerusalem's sake
c36184	which I have chosen.
c36185	And the LORD stirred up an adversary unto Solomon, Hadad the Edomite:
c36186	he <i>was</i> of the king's seed in Edom.
c36187	For it came to pass,
c36188	when David was in Edom,
c36189	and Joab the captain of the host was gone up
c36190	to bury the slain,
c36191	after he had smitten every male in Edom;
c36192	(For six months did Joab remain there with all Israel,
c36193	until he had cut off every male in Edom:)
c36194	Hadad <i>being</i> yet a little child.
c36195	he and certain Edomites of his father's servants with
c36196	him, to go into Egypt;
c36197	That Hadad fled,
c36198	And they arose out of Midian,
c36199	and came to Paran:
c36200	and they took men with them out of Paran,
c36201	and they came to Egypt, unto Pharaoh king of Egypt;
c36202	which gave him an house, and appointed him victuals,
c36204	and gave him land.
c36205	And Hadad found great favour in the sight of Pharaoh,
c36206	so that he gave him to wife the sister of his own wife, the sister of Tahpenes the queen.
c36207	And the sister of Tahpenes bare him Genubath his son,
c36208	whom Tahpenes weaned in Pharaoh's house:
c36209	and Genubath was in Pharaoh's household among the sons of Pharaoh.
c36210	And when Hadad heard in Egypt
c36211	that David slept with his fathers,
c36212	and that Joab the captain of the host was dead,
c36213	Hadad said to Pharaoh,
c36214	Let me depart,
c36215	that I may go to mine own country.
c36216	Then Pharaoh said
c36217	unto him, But what hast thou lacked with
c36218	me, that, behold, thou seekest
c36219	to go to thine own country?
c36220	And he answered,
c36221	Nothing:
c36222	howbeit let me go in any wise.
c36223	And God stirred him up <i>another</i> adversary, Rezon the son of Eliadah,
c36224	which fled from his lord Hadadezer king of Zobah:
c36225	And he gathered men unto
c36226	him, and became captain over a band,
c36227	when David slew
c36228	them <i>of Zobah:</i> and they went to Damascus,
c36229	and dwelt
c36230	therein, and reigned in Damascus.
c36231	And he was an adversary to Israel all the days of Solomon,
c36232	beside the mischief
c36233	that Hadad
c36234	<i>did:</i> and he abhorred Israel,
c36235	and reigned over Syria.
c36236	And Jeroboam the son of Nebat, an Ephrathite of Zereda,
c36237	whose mother's name <i>was</i> Zeruah, a widow woman,
c36238	Solomon's servant,
c36239	even he lifted up <i>his</i> hand against the king.
c36240	And this <i>was</i> the cause
c36241	that he lifted up <i>his</i> hand against the king:
c36242	Solomon built Millo,
c36243	<i>and</i> repaired the breaches of the city of David his father.
c36244	And the man Jeroboam <i>was</i> a mighty man of valour:
c36245	and Solomon seeing the young man
c36246	that he was industrious,
c36247	he made him ruler over all the charge of the house of Joseph.
c36248	And it came to pass at that time
c36249	when Jeroboam went out of Jerusalem,
c36250	that the prophet Ahijah the Shilonite found him in the way;
c36251	and he had clad himself with a new garment;
c36252	and they two <i>were</i> alone in the field:
c36253	And Ahijah caught the new garment
c36254	that <i>was</i> on
c36255	him, and rent it <i>in</i> twelve pieces:
c36256	And he said to Jeroboam,
c36257	Take thee ten pieces:
c36258	for thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel,
c36259	Behold, I will rend the kingdom out of the hand of Solomon,
c36260	and will give ten tribes to thee:
c36261	(But he shall have one tribe for my servant David's sake, and for Jerusalem's sake, the city
c36262	which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel:)
c36263	Because that they have forsaken
c36264	me, and have worshipped Ashtoreth the goddess of the Zidonians, Chemosh the god of the Moabites, and Milcom the god of the children of Ammon,
c36265	and have not walked in my ways,
c36266	to do
c36267	<i>that which is</i> right in mine eyes,
c36268	and <i>to keep</i> my statutes and my judgments, as <i>did</i> David his father.
c36269	Howbeit I will not take the whole kingdom out of his hand:
c36270	but I will make him prince all the days of his life for David my servant's sake,
c36271	whom I chose,
c36272	because he kept my commandments and my statutes:
c36273	But I will take the kingdom out of his son's hand,
c36274	and will give it unto thee, <i>even</i> ten tribes.
c36275	And unto his son will I give one tribe,
c36276	that David my servant may have a light alway before me in Jerusalem, the city
c36277	which I have chosen
c36278	me to put my name there.
c36279	And I will take
c36280	thee, and thou shalt reign according to all
c36281	that thy soul desireth,
c36282	and shalt be king over Israel.
c36283	And it shall be,
c36284	if thou wilt hearken unto all
c36285	that I command
c36286	thee, and wilt walk in my ways,
c36287	and do
c36288	<i>that is</i> right in my sight,
c36289	to keep my statutes and my commandments,
c36290	as David my servant did;
c36291	that I will be with
c36292	thee, and build thee a sure house,
c36293	as I built for David,
c36294	and will give Israel unto thee.
c36295	And I will for this afflict the seed of David,
c36296	but not for ever.
c36297	Solomon sought
c36298	therefore to kill Jeroboam.
c36299	And Jeroboam arose,
c36300	and fled into Egypt, unto Shishak king of Egypt,
c36301	and was in Egypt until the death of Solomon.
c36302	And the rest of the acts of Solomon, and all
c36303	that he did,
c36304	and his wisdom,
c36305	<i>are</i> they not written in the book of the acts of Solomon?
c36306	And the time
c36307	that Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel
c36308	<i>was</i> forty years.
c36309	And Solomon slept with his fathers,
c36310	and was buried in the city of David his father:
c36311	and Rehoboam his son reigned in his stead.
c36312	And Rehoboam went to Shechem:
c36313	for all Israel were come to Shechem
c36314	to make him king.
c36315	And it came to pass,
c36316	when Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who
c36318	was yet in Egypt, heard
c36319	<i>of it,</i> (for he was fled from the presence of king Solomon,
c36320	and Jeroboam dwelt in Egypt;)
c36321	That they sent
c36322	and called
c36323	him. And Jeroboam and all the congregation of Israel came,
c36324	and spake unto Rehoboam,
c36325	saying,
c36326	Thy father made our yoke grievous:
c36328	now therefore make thou the grievous service of thy father, and his heavy yoke which he put upon us, lighter,
c36330	and we will serve thee.
c36331	And he said unto
c36332	them, Depart yet <i>for</i> three days,
c36333	then come again to
c36334	me. And the people departed.
c36335	And king Rehoboam consulted with the old men,
c36336	that stood before Solomon his father while
c36338	he yet lived,
c36339	and said,
c36340	How do ye advise
c36341	that I may answer this people?
c36342	And they spake unto
c36343	him, saying,
c36344	If thou wilt be a servant unto this people this day,
c36345	and wilt serve
c36346	them, and answer
c36347	them, and speak good words to
c36348	them, then they will be thy servants for ever.
c36349	But he forsook the counsel of the old men,
c36350	which they had given
c36351	him, and consulted with the young men that were grown up with
c36353	him, <i>and</i> which stood before him:
c36354	And he said unto
c36355	them, What counsel give ye
c36356	that we may answer this people,
c36357	who have spoken to
c36358	me, saying,
c36359	Make the yoke which thy father did put upon us lighter?
c36361	And the young men that were grown up with him spake unto
c36363	him, saying,
c36364	Thus shalt thou speak unto this people
c36365	that spake unto
c36366	thee, saying,
c36367	Thy father made our yoke heavy,
c36368	but make thou <i>it</i> lighter unto
c36369	us; thus shalt thou say unto
c36370	them, My little <i>finger</i> shall be thicker than my father's loins.
c36371	And now
c36372	whereas my father did lade you with a heavy yoke,
c36373	I will add to your yoke:
c36374	my father hath chastised you with whips,
c36375	but I will chastise you with scorpions.
c36376	So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam the third day,
c36377	as the king had appointed,
c36378	saying,
c36379	Come to me again the third day.
c36380	And the king answered the people roughly,
c36381	and forsook the old men's counsel
c36382	that they gave him;
c36383	And spake to them after the counsel of the young men,
c36384	saying,
c36385	My father made your yoke heavy,
c36386	and I will add to your yoke:
c36387	my father <i>also</i> chastised you with whips,
c36388	but I will chastise you with scorpions.
c36389	Wherefore the king hearkened not unto the people;
c36390	for the cause was from the LORD,
c36391	that he might perform his saying,
c36392	which the LORD spake by Ahijah the Shilonite unto Jeroboam the son of Nebat.
c36393	So when all Israel saw
c36394	that the king hearkened not unto
c36395	them, the people answered the king,
c36396	saying,
c36397	What portion have we in David?
c36398	neither <i>have we</i> inheritance in the son of Jesse:
c36399	to your tents,
c36400	O Israel:
c36401	now see to thine own house,
c36402	David.
c36403	So Israel departed unto their tents.
c36404	But <i>as for</i> the children of Israel
c36405	which dwelt in the cities of Judah,
c36406	Rehoboam reigned over them.
c36407	Then king Rehoboam sent Adoram,
c36408	who <i>was</i> over the tribute;
c36409	and all Israel stoned him with stones,
c36410	that he died.
c36411	Therefore king Rehoboam made speed
c36412	to get him up to his chariot,
c36413	to flee to Jerusalem.
c36414	So Israel rebelled against the house of David unto this day.
c36415	And it came to pass,
c36416	when all Israel heard
c36417	that Jeroboam was come again,
c36418	that they sent
c36419	and called him unto the congregation,
c36420	and made him king over all Israel:
c36421	there was none that followed the house of David, but the tribe of Judah only.
c36422	And when Rehoboam was come to Jerusalem,
c36423	he assembled all the house of Judah, with the tribe of Benjamin, an hundred and fourscore thousand chosen
c36424	men, which were warriors,
c36425	to fight against the house of Israel,
c36426	to bring the kingdom again to Rehoboam the son of Solomon.
c36427	But the word of God came unto Shemaiah the man of God,
c36428	saying,
c36429	Speak unto Rehoboam, the son of Solomon, king of Judah, and unto all the house of Judah and Benjamin, and to the remnant of the people,
c36430	saying,
c36431	Thus saith the LORD,
c36432	Ye shall not go up,
c36433	nor fight against your brethren the children of Israel:
c36434	return
c36435	every man to his house;
c36436	for this thing is from me. They hearkened therefore
c36437	to the word of the LORD,
c36438	and returned
c36439	to depart,
c36440	according to the word of the LORD.
c36441	Then Jeroboam built Shechem in mount Ephraim,
c36442	and dwelt
c36443	therein; and went out from thence,
c36444	and built Penuel.
c36445	And Jeroboam said in his heart,
c36446	Now shall the kingdom return to the house of David:
c36447	If this people go up
c36448	to do sacrifice in the house of the LORD at Jerusalem,
c36449	then shall the heart of this people turn again unto their lord, <i>even</i> unto Rehoboam king of Judah,
c36450	and they shall kill
c36451	me, and go again to Rehoboam king of Judah.
c36452	Whereupon the king took counsel,
c36453	and made two calves <i>of</i> gold,
c36454	and said unto
c36455	them, It is too much
c36456	for you to go up to Jerusalem:
c36457	behold thy gods,
c36458	O Israel,
c36459	which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt.
c36460	And he set the one in Bethel,
c36461	and the other put he in Dan.
c36462	And this thing became a sin:
c36463	for the people went <i>to worship</i> before the one, <i>even</i> unto Dan.
c36464	And he made an house of high places,
c36465	and made priests of the lowest of the people,
c36466	which were not of the sons of Levi.
c36467	And Jeroboam ordained a feast in the eighth month, on the fifteenth day of the month, like unto the feast
c36468	that <i>is</i> in Judah,
c36469	and he offered upon the altar.
c36470	So did he in Bethel,
c36471	sacrificing unto the calves
c36472	that he had made:
c36473	and he placed in Bethel the priests of the high places
c36474	which he had made.
c36475	So he offered upon the altar
c36476	which he had made in Bethel
c36477	the fifteenth day of the eighth month, <i>even</i> in the month
c36478	which he had devised of his own heart;
c36479	and ordained a feast unto the children of Israel:
c36480	and he offered upon the altar,
c36481	and burnt incense.
c36482	And, behold,
c36483	there came a man of God out of Judah by the word of the LORD unto Bethel:
c36484	and Jeroboam stood by the altar
c36485	to burn incense.
c36486	And he cried against the altar in the word of the LORD,
c36487	and said,
c36488	O altar, altar,
c36489	thus saith the LORD;
c36490	Behold, a child shall be born unto the house of David,
c36491	Josiah by name;
c36492	and upon thee shall he offer the priests of the high places
c36493	that burn incense upon
c36494	thee, and men's bones shall be burnt upon thee.
c36495	And he gave a sign the same day,
c36496	saying,
c36497	This <i>is</i> the sign
c36498	which the LORD hath spoken;
c36499	Behold, the altar shall be rent,
c36500	and the ashes that <i>are</i> upon it shall be poured out.
c36502	And it came to pass,
c36503	when king Jeroboam heard the saying of the man of God,
c36504	which had cried against the altar in Bethel,
c36505	that he put forth his hand from the altar,
c36506	saying,
c36507	Lay hold
c36508	on him. And his hand, which he put forth against him, dried up,
c36510	so that he could not
c36511	pull it in again to him.
c36512	The altar also was rent,
c36513	and the ashes poured out from the altar,
c36514	according to the sign
c36515	which the man of God had given by the word of the LORD.
c36516	And the king answered
c36517	and said unto the man of God,
c36518	Intreat now the face of the LORD thy God,
c36519	and pray for
c36520	me, that my hand may be restored me again.
c36521	And the man of God besought the LORD,
c36522	and the king's hand was restored him again,
c36523	and became as <i>it was</i> before.
c36524	And the king said unto the man of God,
c36525	Come home with
c36526	me, and refresh
c36527	thyself, and I will give thee a reward.
c36528	And the man of God said unto the king,
c36529	If thou wilt give me half thine house,
c36530	I will not go in with
c36531	thee, neither will I eat bread
c36532	nor drink water in this place:
c36533	For so was it charged me by the word of the LORD,
c36534	saying,
c36535	Eat no bread,
c36536	nor drink water,
c36537	nor turn again by the same way
c36538	that thou camest.
c36539	So he went another way,
c36540	and returned not by the way
c36541	that he came to Bethel.
c36542	Now there dwelt an old prophet in Bethel;
c36543	and his sons came
c36544	and told him all the works
c36545	that the man of God had done that day in Bethel:
c36546	the words
c36547	which he had spoken unto the king,
c36548	them they told also to their father.
c36549	And their father said unto
c36550	them, What way
c36551	went
c36552	he? For his sons had seen what way
c36553	the man of God went,
c36554	which came from Judah.
c36555	And he said unto his sons,
c36556	Saddle me the ass.
c36557	So they saddled him the ass:
c36558	and he rode thereon,
c36559	And went after the man of God,
c36560	and found
c36561	him sitting under an oak:
c36562	and he said unto
c36563	him, <i>Art</i> thou the man of God
c36564	that camest from Judah?
c36565	And he said,
c36566	I <i>am.</i>
c36567	Then he said unto
c36568	him, Come home with
c36569	me, and eat bread.
c36570	And he said,
c36571	I may not
c36572	return with
c36573	thee, nor go in with
c36574	thee: neither will I eat bread
c36575	nor drink water with thee in this place:
c36576	For it was said to me by the word of the LORD,
c36577	Thou shalt eat no bread
c36578	nor drink water there,
c36579	nor turn again
c36580	to go by the way
c36581	that thou camest.
c36582	He said
c36583	unto him, I <i>am</i> a prophet also
c36584	as thou <i>art;</i> and an angel spake unto me by the word of the LORD,
c36585	saying,
c36586	Bring him back with thee into thine house,
c36587	that he may eat bread
c36588	and drink water.
c36589	<i>But</i> he lied unto him.
c36590	So he went back with
c36591	him, and did eat bread in his house,
c36592	and drank water.
c36593	And it came to pass,
c36594	as they sat at the table,
c36595	that the word of the LORD came unto the prophet
c36596	that brought him back:
c36597	And he cried unto the man of God
c36598	that came from Judah,
c36599	saying,
c36600	Thus saith the LORD,
c36601	Forasmuch as thou hast disobeyed the mouth of the LORD,
c36602	and hast not kept the commandment
c36603	which the LORD thy God commanded thee,
c36604	But camest back,
c36605	and hast eaten bread
c36606	and drunk water in the place,
c36607	of the which <i>the LORD</i> did say to
c36608	thee, Eat no bread,
c36609	and drink no water;
c36610	thy carcase shall not come unto the sepulchre of thy fathers.
c36611	And it came to pass,
c36612	after he had eaten bread,
c36613	and after he had drunk,
c36614	that he saddled for him the ass, <i>to wit,</i> for the prophet
c36615	whom he had brought back.
c36616	And when he was gone,
c36617	a lion met him by the way,
c36618	and slew
c36619	him: and his carcase was
c36620	cast in the way,
c36621	and the ass stood by
c36622	it, the lion also stood by the carcase.
c36623	And, behold, men passed by,
c36624	and saw the carcase
c36625	cast in the way,
c36626	and the lion
c36627	standing by the carcase:
c36628	and they came
c36629	and told <i>it</i> in the city
c36630	where the old prophet dwelt.
c36631	And when the prophet that brought him back from the way heard
c36633	<i>thereof,</i> he said,
c36634	It <i>is</i> the man of God,
c36635	who was disobedient unto the word of the LORD:
c36636	therefore the LORD hath delivered him unto the lion,
c36637	which hath torn
c36638	him, and slain him, according to the word of the LORD,
c36639	which he spake unto him.
c36640	And he spake to his sons,
c36641	saying,
c36642	Saddle me the ass.
c36643	And they saddled <i>him.</i>
c36644	And he went
c36645	and found his carcase
c36646	cast in the way,
c36647	and the ass and the lion standing by the carcase:
c36648	the lion had not eaten the carcase,
c36649	nor torn the ass.
c36650	And the prophet took up the carcase of the man of God,
c36651	and laid it upon the ass,
c36652	and brought it back:
c36653	and the old prophet came to the city,
c36654	to mourn
c36655	and to bury him.
c36656	And he laid his carcase in his own grave;
c36657	and they mourned over
c36658	him, <i>saying,</i> Alas, my brother!
c36659	And it came to pass,
c36660	after he had buried
c36661	him, that he spake to his sons,
c36662	saying,
c36663	When I am dead,
c36664	then bury me in the sepulchre
c36665	wherein the man of God <i>is</i> buried;
c36666	lay my bones beside his bones:
c36667	For the saying which he cried by the word of the LORD against the altar
c36669	in Bethel, and against all the houses of the high places which
c36671	<i>are</i> in the cities of Samaria, shall surely come to pass.
c36672	After this thing Jeroboam returned not from his evil way,
c36674	but made again of the lowest of the people priests of the high places:
c36675	whosoever would,
c36676	he consecrated
c36677	him, and he became <i>one</i> of the priests of the high places.
c36678	And this thing became sin unto the house of Jeroboam,
c36679	even to cut <i>it</i> off,
c36680	and to destroy <i>it</i> from off the face of the earth.
c36681	At that time Abijah the son of Jeroboam fell sick.
c36682	And Jeroboam said to his wife,
c36683	Arise, I pray thee,
c36684	and disguise thyself,
c36686	that thou be not known to be the wife of Jeroboam;
c36687	and get thee to Shiloh:
c36688	behold, there <i>is</i> Ahijah the prophet,
c36689	which told me that <i>I should be</i> king over this people.
c36690	And take with thee ten loaves, and cracknels, and a cruse of honey,
c36691	and go to
c36692	him: he shall tell
c36693	thee what shall become of the child.
c36694	And Jeroboam's wife did so,
c36695	and arose,
c36696	and went to Shiloh,
c36697	and came to the house of Ahijah.
c36698	But Ahijah could not
c36699	see;
c36700	for his eyes were set by reason of his age.
c36701	And the LORD said unto Ahijah,
c36702	Behold, the wife of Jeroboam cometh
c36703	to ask a thing of thee for her son;
c36704	for he <i>is</i> sick:
c36705	thus and thus shalt thou say unto
c36706	her: for it shall be,
c36707	when she cometh in,
c36708	that she shall feign herself <i>to be</i> another <i>woman.</i>
c36709	And it was
c36710	<i>so,</i> when Ahijah heard the sound of her feet,
c36711	as she came in at the door,
c36712	that he said,
c36713	Come in,
c36714	thou wife of Jeroboam;
c36715	why feignest thou thyself <i>to be</i> another?
c36716	for I <i>am</i> sent to thee <i>with</i> heavy <i>tidings.</i>
c36717	Go,
c36718	tell Jeroboam,
c36719	Thus saith the LORD God of Israel,
c36720	Forasmuch as I exalted thee from among the people,
c36721	and made thee prince over my people Israel,
c36722	And rent the kingdom away from the house of David,
c36723	and gave
c36724	it thee: and <i>yet</i> thou hast not been as my servant David,
c36725	who kept my commandments,
c36726	and who followed me with all his heart,
c36727	to do <i>that</i> only <i>which was</i> right in mine eyes;
c36728	evil
c36729	But hast done
c36730	above all
c36731	that were before
c36732	thee: for thou hast gone
c36733	and made thee other gods, and molten images,
c36734	to provoke me to anger,
c36735	and hast cast me behind thy back:
c36736	Therefore, behold, I will bring evil upon the house of Jeroboam,
c36737	and will cut off from Jeroboam
c36738	him that pisseth against the wall,
c36739	<i>and</i> him that is shut up
c36740	and left in Israel,
c36741	and will take away the remnant of the house of Jeroboam,
c36742	as a man taketh away dung,
c36743	till it be all gone.
c36744	Him that dieth of Jeroboam in the city
c36745	shall the dogs eat;
c36747	and him that dieth in the field
c36748	shall the fowls of the air eat:
c36749	for the LORD hath spoken <i>it.</i>
c36750	Arise thou
c36751	therefore, get thee to thine own house:
c36752	<i>and</i> when thy feet enter into the city,
c36753	the child shall die.
c36754	And all Israel shall mourn
c36755	for him, and bury
c36756	him: for he only of Jeroboam shall come to the grave,
c36757	because in him there is found <i>some</i> good thing toward the LORD God of Israel in the house of Jeroboam.
c36758	Moreover the LORD shall raise him up a king over Israel,
c36759	who shall cut off the house of Jeroboam
c36760	that day:
c36761	but what? even now.
c36762	For the LORD shall smite Israel,
c36763	as a reed is shaken in the water,
c36764	and he shall root up Israel out of this good land,
c36765	which he gave to their fathers,
c36766	and shall scatter them beyond the river,
c36767	because they have made their groves,
c36768	provoking the LORD to anger.
c36769	And he shall give Israel up because of the sins of Jeroboam,
c36770	who did sin,
c36771	and who made Israel to sin.
c36772	And Jeroboam's wife arose,
c36773	and departed,
c36774	and came to Tirzah:
c36775	<i>and</i> when she came to the threshold of the door,
c36776	the child died;
c36777	And they buried
c36778	him; and all Israel mourned for him, according to the word of the LORD,
c36779	which he spake by the hand of his servant Ahijah the prophet.
c36780	And the rest of the acts of Jeroboam,
c36781	how he warred,
c36782	and how he reigned,
c36783	behold, they <i>are</i> written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel.
c36784	And the days
c36785	which Jeroboam reigned
c36786	<i>were</i> two and twenty years:
c36787	and he slept with his fathers,
c36788	and Nadab his son reigned in his stead.
c36789	And Rehoboam the son of Solomon reigned in Judah.
c36790	Rehoboam <i>was</i> forty and one years old
c36791	when he began to reign,
c36792	and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city
c36793	which the LORD did choose
c36794	to put his name there.
c36795	out of all the tribes of Israel,
c36796	And his mother's name <i>was</i> Naamah an Ammonitess.
c36797	And Judah did
c36798	evil in the sight of the LORD,
c36799	and they provoked him to jealousy with their sins
c36800	which they had committed, above all
c36802	that their fathers had done.
c36803	For they also built them high places, and images, and groves, on every high hill, and under every green tree.
c36804	And there were also sodomites in the land:
c36805	<i>and</i> they did according to all the abominations of the nations
c36806	which the LORD cast out before the children of Israel.
c36807	And it came to pass in the fifth year of king Rehoboam,
c36808	<i>that</i> Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem:
c36809	And he took away the treasures of the house of the LORD, and the treasures of the king's house;
c36810	he even took away all:
c36811	and he took away all the shields of gold
c36812	which Solomon had made.
c36813	And king Rehoboam made in their stead brasen shields,
c36814	and committed <i>them</i> unto the hands of the chief of the guard,
c36815	which kept the door of the king's house.
c36816	And it was
c36817	<i>so,</i> when the king went into the house of the LORD,
c36818	that the guard bare
c36819	them, and brought them back into the guard chamber.
c36820	Now the rest of the acts of Rehoboam, and all
c36821	that he did,
c36822	<i>are</i> they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
c36823	And there was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all <i>their</i> days.
c36824	And Rehoboam slept with his fathers,
c36825	and was buried with his fathers in the city of David.
c36826	And his mother's name <i>was</i> Naamah an Ammonitess.
c36827	And Abijam his son reigned in his stead.
c36828	Now in the eighteenth year of king Jeroboam the son of Nebat reigned Abijam over Judah.
c36829	Three years reigned he in Jerusalem.
c36830	And his mother's name <i>was</i> Maachah, the daughter of Abishalom.
c36831	And he walked in all the sins of his father,
c36832	which he had done before
c36833	him: and his heart was not perfect with the LORD his God, as the heart of David his father.
c36834	Nevertheless for David's sake did the LORD his God give him a lamp in Jerusalem,
c36835	to set up his son after
c36836	him, and to establish Jerusalem:
c36837	Because David did <i>that which was</i> right in the eyes of the LORD,
c36838	and turned not aside from any
c36839	<i>thing</i> that he commanded
c36840	him all the days of his life,
c36841	save only in the matter of Uriah the Hittite.
c36842	And there was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all the days of his life.
c36843	Now the rest of the acts of Abijam, and all
c36844	that he did,
c36845	<i>are</i> they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
c36846	And there was war between Abijam and Jeroboam.
c36847	And Abijam slept with his fathers;
c36848	and they buried him in the city of David:
c36849	and Asa his son reigned in his stead.
c36850	And in the twentieth year of Jeroboam king of Israel reigned Asa over Judah.
c36851	And forty and one years reigned he in Jerusalem.
c36852	And his mother's name <i>was</i> Maachah, the daughter of Abishalom.
c36853	And Asa did
c36854	<i>that which was</i> right in the eyes of the LORD,
c36855	as <i>did</i> David his father.
c36856	And he took away the sodomites out of the land,
c36857	and removed all the idols
c36858	that his fathers had made.
c36859	And also Maachah his mother,
c36860	even her he removed from <i>being</i> queen,
c36861	because she had made an idol in a grove;
c36862	and Asa destroyed her idol,
c36863	and burnt <i>it</i> by the brook Kidron.
c36864	But the high places were not removed:
c36865	nevertheless Asa's heart was perfect with the LORD all his days.
c36866	And he brought in the things which his father had dedicated, and the things which himself had dedicated, into the house of the LORD, silver, and gold, and vessels.
c36867	And there was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all their days.
c36868	And Baasha king of Israel went up against Judah,
c36869	and built Ramah,
c36870	that he might not suffer any to go out or come in to Asa king of Judah.
c36871	Then Asa took all the silver and the gold
c36872	<i>that were</i> left in the treasures of the house of the LORD,
c36873	and the treasures of the king's house,
c36874	and delivered them into the hand of his servants:
c36875	and king Asa sent them to Benhadad, the son of Tabrimon, the son of Hezion, king of Syria,
c36876	that dwelt at Damascus,
c36877	saying,
c36878	<i>There is</i> a league between me and thee, <i>and</i> between
c36879	my father and thy father:
c36880	behold, I have sent unto thee a present of silver and gold;
c36881	come
c36882	and break thy league with Baasha king of Israel,
c36883	that he may depart from me.
c36884	So Benhadad hearkened unto king Asa,
c36885	and sent the captains of the hosts
c36886	which
c36887	he had against the cities of Israel,
c36888	and smote Ijon, and Dan, and Abelbethmaachah, and all Cinneroth, with all the land of Naphtali.
c36889	And it came to pass,
c36890	when Baasha heard
c36891	<i>thereof,</i> that he left off
c36892	building of Ramah,
c36893	and dwelt in Tirzah.
c36894	Then king Asa made a proclamation throughout all Judah;
c36895	none <i>was</i> exempted:
c36896	and they took away the stones of Ramah, and the timber
c36897	thereof, wherewith Baasha had builded;
c36898	and king Asa built with them Geba of Benjamin, and Mizpah.
c36899	The rest of all the acts of Asa, and all his might, and all
c36900	that he did,
c36901	and the cities
c36902	which he built,
c36903	<i>are</i> they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
c36904	Nevertheless in the time of his old age he was diseased in his feet.
c36905	And Asa slept with his fathers,
c36906	and was buried with his fathers in the city of David his father:
c36907	and Jehoshaphat his son reigned in his stead.
c36908	And Nadab the son of Jeroboam began to reign over Israel in the second year of Asa king of Judah,
c36909	and reigned over Israel two years.
c36910	And he did
c36911	evil in the sight of the LORD,
c36912	and walked in the way of his father, and in his sin
c36913	wherewith he made Israel to sin.
c36914	And Baasha the son of Ahijah, of the house of Issachar, conspired against
c36915	him; and Baasha smote him at Gibbethon,
c36916	which <i>belonged</i> to the Philistines;
c36917	for Nadab and all Israel laid siege to Gibbethon.
c36918	Even in the third year of Asa king of Judah did Baasha slay
c36919	him, and reigned in his stead.
c36920	And it came to pass,
c36921	when he reigned,
c36922	<i>that</i> he smote all the house of Jeroboam;
c36923	he left not to Jeroboam any that breathed,
c36924	until he had destroyed
c36925	him, according unto the saying of the LORD,
c36926	which he spake by his servant Ahijah the Shilonite:
c36927	Because of the sins of Jeroboam
c36928	which he sinned,
c36929	and which he made Israel sin,
c36930	by his provocation
c36931	wherewith he provoked the LORD God of Israel to anger.
c36932	Now the rest of the acts of Nadab, and all
c36933	that he did,
c36934	<i>are</i> they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
c36935	And there was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all their days.
c36936	In the third year of Asa king of Judah began Baasha the son of Ahijah to reign over all Israel in Tirzah, twenty and four years.
c36937	And he did
c36938	evil in the sight of the LORD,
c36939	and walked in the way of Jeroboam, and in his sin
c36940	wherewith he made Israel to sin.
c36941	Then the word of the LORD came to Jehu the son of Hanani against Baasha,
c36942	saying,
c36943	Forasmuch as I exalted thee out of the dust,
c36944	and made thee prince over my people Israel;
c36945	and thou hast walked in the way of Jeroboam,
c36946	and hast made my people Israel to sin,
c36947	to provoke me to anger with their sins;
c36948	Behold, I will take away the posterity of Baasha, and the posterity of his house;
c36949	and will make thy house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat.
c36950	Him that dieth of Baasha in the city
c36951	shall the dogs eat;
c36953	and him that dieth of his in the fields
c36954	shall the fowls of the air eat.
c36955	Now the rest of the acts of Baasha,
c36956	and what he did,
c36957	and his might,
c36958	<i>are</i> they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
c36959	So Baasha slept with his fathers,
c36960	and was buried in Tirzah:
c36961	and Elah his son reigned in his stead.
c36962	And also by the hand of the prophet Jehu the son of Hanani came the word of the LORD against Baasha, and against his house,
c36963	even for all the evil
c36964	that he did in the sight of the LORD,
c36965	in provoking him to anger with the work of his hands,
c36966	in being like the house of Jeroboam;
c36967	and because he killed him.
c36968	In the twenty and sixth year of Asa king of Judah began Elah the son of Baasha to reign over Israel in Tirzah, two years.
c36969	And his servant Zimri, captain of half <i>his</i> chariots, conspired against
c36970	him, as he was in Tirzah,
c36971	drinking himself drunk in the house of Arza
c36972	steward of <i>his</i> house in Tirzah.
c36973	And Zimri went in
c36974	and smote
c36975	him, and killed him, in the twenty and seventh year of Asa king of Judah,
c36976	and reigned in his stead.
c36977	And it came to pass,
c36978	when he began to reign,
c36979	as soon as he sat on his throne,
c36980	<i>that</i> he slew all the house of Baasha:
c36981	he left him not
c36982	one that pisseth against a wall,
c36983	neither of his kinsfolks, nor of his friends.
c36984	Thus did Zimri destroy all the house of Baasha, according to the word of the LORD,
c36985	which he spake against Baasha by Jehu the prophet,
c36986	For all the sins of Baasha, and the sins of Elah his son,
c36987	by which they sinned,
c36988	and by which they made Israel to sin,
c36989	in provoking the LORD God of Israel to anger with their vanities.
c36990	Now the rest of the acts of Elah, and all
c36991	that he did,
c36992	<i>are</i> they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
c36993	In the twenty and seventh year of Asa king of Judah did Zimri reign seven days in Tirzah.
c36994	And the people <i>were</i> encamped against Gibbethon,
c36995	which <i>belonged</i> to the Philistines.
c36996	And the people <i>that were</i> encamped heard
c36998	say,
c36999	Zimri hath conspired,
c37000	and hath also slain the king:
c37001	wherefore all Israel made Omri, the captain of the host, king over Israel that day in the camp.
c37002	And Omri went up
c37003	and all Israel with
c37004	from Gibbethon,
c37005	him, and they besieged Tirzah.
c37006	And it came to pass,
c37007	when Zimri saw
c37008	that the city was taken,
c37009	that he went into the palace of the king's house,
c37010	and burnt the king's house over him with fire,
c37011	and died,
c37012	For his sins
c37013	which he sinned
c37014	in doing
c37015	evil in the sight of the LORD,
c37016	in walking in the way of Jeroboam, and in his sin
c37017	which he did,
c37018	to make Israel to sin.
c37019	Now the rest of the acts of Zimri, and his treason
c37020	that he wrought,
c37021	<i>are</i> they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
c37022	Then were the people of Israel divided into two parts:
c37023	half of the people followed Tibni the son of Ginath,
c37024	to make him king;
c37025	and half followed Omri.
c37026	But the people that followed Omri prevailed against
c37028	the people
c37029	that followed Tibni the son of Ginath:
c37030	so Tibni died,
c37031	and Omri reigned.
c37032	In the thirty and first year of Asa king of Judah began Omri to reign over Israel, twelve years: six years
c37033	reigned he in Tirzah.
c37034	And he bought the hill Samaria of Shemer for two talents of silver,
c37035	and built on the hill,
c37036	and called the name of the city
c37037	which he built,
c37038	after the name of Shemer, owner of the hill, Samaria.
c37039	But Omri wrought
c37040	evil in the eyes of the LORD,
c37041	and did worse than all
c37042	that <i>were</i> before him.
c37043	For he walked in all the way of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and in his sin
c37044	wherewith he made Israel to sin,
c37045	to provoke the LORD God of Israel to anger with their vanities.
c37046	Now the rest of the acts of Omri
c37047	which he did,
c37048	and his might
c37049	that he shewed,
c37050	<i>are</i> they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
c37051	So Omri slept with his fathers,
c37052	and was buried in Samaria:
c37053	and Ahab his son reigned in his stead.
c37054	And in the thirty and eighth year of Asa king of Judah began Ahab the son of Omri to reign over Israel: and Ahab the son of Omri reigned over Israel in Samaria twenty and two years.
c37056	And Ahab the son of Omri did
c37057	evil in the sight of the LORD
c37058	above all
c37059	that <i>were</i> before him.
c37060	And it came to pass,
c37061	as if it had been a light thing
c37062	for him to walk in the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat,
c37063	that he took to wife Jezebel the daughter of Ethbaal king of the Zidonians,
c37064	and went
c37065	and served Baal,
c37066	and worshipped him.
c37067	And he reared up an altar for Baal in the house of Baal,
c37068	which he had built in Samaria.
c37069	And Ahab made a grove;
c37070	and Ahab did more
c37072	to provoke the LORD God of Israel to anger than all the kings of Israel
c37073	that were before him.
c37074	In his days did Hiel the Bethelite build Jericho:
c37075	he laid the foundation thereof in Abiram his firstborn,
c37076	and set up the gates thereof in his youngest <i>son</i> Segub,
c37077	according to the word of the LORD,
c37078	which he spake by Joshua the son of Nun.
c37079	And Elijah the Tishbite, <i>who was</i> of the inhabitants of Gilead, said unto Ahab,
c37080	<i>As</i> the LORD God of Israel liveth,
c37081	before whom I stand,
c37082	there shall not be dew nor rain these years,
c37083	but according to my word.
c37084	And the word of the LORD came unto
c37085	him, saying,
c37086	Get thee hence,
c37087	and turn thee eastward,
c37088	and hide thyself by the brook Cherith,
c37089	that <i>is</i> before Jordan.
c37090	And it shall be,
c37091	<i>that</i> thou shalt drink of the brook;
c37092	and I have commanded the ravens
c37093	to feed thee there.
c37094	So he went
c37095	and did according unto the word of the LORD:
c37096	for he went
c37097	and dwelt by the brook Cherith,
c37098	that <i>is</i> before Jordan.
c37099	And the ravens brought him bread and flesh in the morning,
c37100	and bread and flesh in the evening;
c37101	and he drank of the brook.
c37102	And it came to pass after a while,
c37103	that the brook dried up,
c37104	because there had been no rain in the land.
c37105	And the word of the LORD came unto
c37106	him, saying,
c37107	Arise,
c37108	get thee to Zarephath,
c37109	which <i>belongeth</i> to Zidon,
c37110	and dwell there:
c37111	behold, I have commanded a widow woman there
c37112	to sustain thee.
c37113	So he arose
c37114	and went to Zarephath.
c37115	And when he came to the gate of the city,
c37116	behold, the widow woman <i>was</i> there
c37117	gathering of sticks:
c37118	and he called to
c37119	her, and said,
c37120	Fetch me, I pray thee, a little water in a vessel,
c37121	that I may drink.
c37122	And as she was going
c37123	to fetch
c37124	<i>it,</i> he called to
c37125	her, and said,
c37126	Bring me, I pray thee, a morsel of bread in thine hand.
c37127	And she said,
c37128	<i>As</i> the LORD thy God liveth,
c37129	I have not a cake,
c37130	but an handful of meal in a barrel, and a little oil in a cruse:
c37131	and, behold, I <i>am</i> gathering two sticks,
c37132	that I may go in
c37133	and dress it for me and my son,
c37134	that we may eat
c37135	it, and die.
c37136	And Elijah said unto
c37137	her, Fear not;
c37138	go
c37139	<i>and</i> do as thou hast said:
c37140	but make me thereof a little cake first,
c37141	and bring
c37142	<i>it</i> unto me, and after make for thee and for thy son.
c37143	For thus saith the LORD God of Israel,
c37144	The barrel of meal shall not waste,
c37145	neither shall the cruse of oil fail,
c37146	until the day
c37147	<i>that</i> the LORD sendeth rain upon the earth.
c37148	And she went
c37149	and did according to the saying of Elijah:
c37150	and she, and he, and her house, did eat <i>many</i> days.
c37151	<i>And</i> the barrel of meal wasted not,
c37152	neither did the cruse of oil fail,
c37153	according to the word of the LORD,
c37154	which he spake by Elijah.
c37155	And it came to pass after these things,
c37156	<i>that</i> the son of the woman, the mistress of the house, fell sick;
c37157	and his sickness was so sore,
c37158	that there was no breath left in him.
c37159	And she said unto Elijah,
c37160	What
c37161	have I to do with thee, O thou man of God?
c37162	art thou come unto
c37163	me to call my sin to remembrance,
c37164	and to slay my son?
c37165	And he said unto
c37166	her, Give me thy son.
c37167	And he took him out of her bosom,
c37168	and carried him up into a loft,
c37169	where he abode,
c37170	and laid him upon his own bed.
c37171	And he cried unto the LORD,
c37172	and said,
c37173	O LORD my God,
c37174	hast thou also brought evil upon the widow
c37175	with whom I sojourn,
c37177	by slaying her son?
c37178	And he stretched himself upon the child three times,
c37179	and cried unto the LORD,
c37180	and said,
c37181	O LORD my God,
c37182	I pray thee, let this child's soul come into him again.
c37183	And the LORD heard the voice of Elijah;
c37184	and the soul of the child came into him again,
c37185	and he revived.
c37186	And Elijah took the child,
c37187	and brought him down out of the chamber into the house,
c37188	and delivered him unto his mother:
c37189	and Elijah said,
c37190	See,
c37191	thy son liveth.
c37192	And the woman said to Elijah,
c37193	Now by this I know
c37194	that thou <i>art</i> a man of God,
c37195	<i>and</i> that the word of the LORD in thy mouth <i>is</i> truth.
c37196	And it came to pass <i>after</i> many days,
c37197	that the word of the LORD came to Elijah in the third year,
c37198	saying,
c37199	Go,
c37200	shew thyself unto Ahab;
c37201	and I will send rain upon the earth.
c37202	And Elijah went
c37203	to shew himself unto Ahab.
c37204	And <i>there was</i> a sore famine in Samaria.
c37205	And Ahab called Obadiah,
c37206	which <i>was</i> the governor of <i>his</i> house.
c37207	(Now Obadiah feared the LORD greatly:
c37208	For it was
c37209	<i>so,</i> when Jezebel cut off the prophets of the LORD,
c37210	that Obadiah took an hundred prophets,
c37211	and hid
c37212	them by fifty in a cave,
c37213	and fed them with bread and water.)
c37214	And Ahab said unto Obadiah,
c37215	Go into the land, unto all fountains of water, and unto all brooks:
c37216	peradventure we may find grass
c37217	to save the horses and mules alive,
c37218	that we lose not all the beasts.
c37219	So they divided the land
c37220	between them to pass
c37221	throughout it: Ahab went one way by himself,
c37222	and Obadiah went another way by himself.
c37223	And as Obadiah was in the way,
c37224	behold, Elijah
c37225	met
c37226	him: and he knew
c37227	him, and fell on his face,
c37228	and said,
c37229	<i>Art</i> thou that
c37230	my lord Elijah?
c37231	And he answered
c37232	him, I
c37233	<i>am:</i> go,
c37234	tell thy lord,
c37235	Behold, Elijah <i>is here.</i>
c37236	And he said,
c37237	What have I sinned,
c37238	that thou wouldest deliver thy servant into the hand of Ahab,
c37239	to slay me?
c37240	<i>As</i> the LORD thy God liveth,
c37241	there is no nation or kingdom,
c37242	whither my lord hath not sent
c37243	to seek
c37244	thee: and when they said,
c37245	<i>He is</i> not
c37246	<i>there;</i> he took an oath of the kingdom and nation,
c37247	that they found thee not.
c37248	And now
c37249	thou sayest,
c37250	Go,
c37251	tell thy lord,
c37252	Behold, Elijah <i>is here.</i>
c37253	And it shall come to pass,
c37254	<i>as soon as</i> I am gone from
c37255	thee, that the Spirit of the LORD shall carry
c37256	thee whither I know not;
c37257	and <i>so</i> when I come
c37258	and tell Ahab,
c37259	and he cannot find
c37260	thee, he shall slay
c37261	me: but I thy servant fear the LORD from my youth.
c37262	Was it not told my lord
c37263	what I did
c37264	when Jezebel slew the prophets of the LORD,
c37265	how I hid an hundred men of the LORD'S prophets
c37266	by fifty in a cave,
c37267	and fed them with bread and water?
c37268	And now
c37269	thou sayest,
c37270	Go,
c37271	tell thy lord,
c37272	Behold, Elijah
c37273	<i>is here:</i> and he shall slay me.
c37274	And Elijah said,
c37275	<i>As</i> the LORD of hosts liveth,
c37276	before whom I stand,
c37277	I will surely shew myself unto him to day.
c37278	So Obadiah went
c37279	to meet Ahab,
c37280	and told
c37281	him: and Ahab went
c37282	to meet Elijah.
c37283	And it came to pass,
c37284	when Ahab saw Elijah,
c37285	that Ahab said unto
c37286	him, <i>Art</i> thou he that
c37287	troubleth Israel?
c37288	And he answered,
c37289	I have not troubled Israel;
c37290	but thou, and thy father's house,
c37291	in that ye have forsaken the commandments of the LORD,
c37292	and thou hast followed Baalim.
c37293	Now
c37294	therefore send,
c37295	<i>and</i> gather to me all Israel unto mount Carmel,
c37296	and the prophets of Baal four hundred and fifty,
c37297	and the prophets of the groves four hundred,
c37298	which eat at Jezebel's table.
c37299	So Ahab sent unto all the children of Israel,
c37300	and gathered the prophets together unto mount Carmel.
c37301	And Elijah came unto all the people,
c37302	and said,
c37303	How long halt ye between two opinions?
c37304	if the LORD <i>be</i> God,
c37305	follow
c37306	him: but if Baal,
c37307	<i>then</i> follow
c37308	him. And the people answered him not a word.
c37309	Then said Elijah unto the people,
c37310	I, <i>even</i> I only, remain a prophet of the LORD;
c37311	but Baal's prophets <i>are</i> four hundred and fifty men.
c37312	Let them therefore give us two bullocks;
c37313	and let them choose one bullock
c37314	for themselves, and cut it in pieces,
c37315	and lay <i>it</i> on wood,
c37316	and put no fire
c37317	<i>under:</i> and I will dress the other bullock,
c37318	and lay <i>it</i> on wood,
c37319	and put no fire <i>under:</i>
c37320	And call ye on the name of your gods,
c37321	and I will call on the name of the LORD:
c37323	and the God
c37324	that answereth by fire,
c37325	let him be God.
c37326	And all the people answered
c37327	and said,
c37328	It is well spoken.
c37329	And Elijah said unto the prophets of Baal,
c37330	Choose you one bullock
c37331	for yourselves, and dress <i>it</i> first;
c37332	for ye <i>are</i> many;
c37333	and call on the name of your gods,
c37334	but put no fire <i>under.</i>
c37335	And they took the bullock
c37336	which was given
c37337	them, and they dressed
c37338	<i>it,</i> and called on the name of Baal from morning even until noon,
c37339	saying,
c37340	O Baal,
c37341	hear
c37342	us. But <i>there was</i> no voice,
c37343	nor any that answered.
c37344	And they leaped upon the altar
c37345	which was made.
c37346	And it came to pass at noon,
c37347	that Elijah mocked
c37348	them, and said,
c37349	Cry aloud:
c37350	for he <i>is</i> a god;
c37351	either he is talking,
c37352	or he is pursuing,
c37353	or he is in a journey,
c37354	<i>or</i> peradventure he sleepeth,
c37355	and must be awaked.
c37356	And they cried aloud,
c37357	and cut themselves after their manner with knives and lancets,
c37358	till the blood gushed out upon them.
c37359	And it came to pass,
c37360	when midday was past,
c37361	and they prophesied
c37362	until the <i>time</i> of the offering of the <i>evening</i> sacrifice,
c37363	that <i>there was</i> neither voice,
c37364	nor any to answer,
c37365	nor any that regarded.
c37366	And Elijah said unto all the people,
c37367	Come near unto
c37368	me. And all the people came near unto
c37369	him. And he repaired the altar of the LORD
c37370	<i>that was</i> broken down.
c37371	And Elijah took twelve stones, according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Jacob,
c37372	unto whom the word of the LORD came,
c37373	saying,
c37374	Israel shall be thy name:
c37375	And with the stones he built an altar in the name of the LORD:
c37376	and he made a trench about the altar, as great as would contain two measures of seed.
c37377	And he put the wood
c37378	in order, and cut the bullock
c37379	in pieces, and laid <i>him</i> on the wood,
c37380	and said,
c37381	Fill four barrels with water,
c37382	and pour <i>it</i> on the burnt sacrifice, and on the wood.
c37383	And he said,
c37384	Do <i>it</i> the second time.
c37385	And they did <i>it</i> the second time.
c37386	And he said,
c37387	Do <i>it</i> the third time.
c37388	And they did <i>it</i> the third time.
c37389	And the water ran round about the altar;
c37390	and he filled the trench also with water.
c37391	And it came to pass
c37392	at <i>the time of</i> the offering of the <i>evening</i> sacrifice,
c37393	that Elijah the prophet came near,
c37394	and said,
c37395	LORD God of Abraham, Isaac, and of Israel,
c37396	let it be known this day
c37397	that thou <i>art</i> God in Israel,
c37398	and <i>that</i> I <i>am</i> thy servant,
c37399	and <i>that</i> I have done all these things at thy word.
c37400	Hear
c37401	me, O LORD,
c37402	hear
c37403	me, that this people may know
c37404	that thou <i>art</i> the LORD God,
c37405	and <i>that</i> thou hast turned their heart back again.
c37406	Then the fire of the LORD fell,
c37407	and consumed the burnt sacrifice, and the wood, and the stones, and the dust,
c37408	the water
c37409	that <i>was</i> in the trench.
c37410	and licked up
c37411	And when all the people saw
c37412	<i>it,</i> they fell on their faces:
c37413	and they said,
c37414	The LORD,
c37415	he <i>is</i> the God;
c37416	the LORD,
c37417	he <i>is</i> the God.
c37418	And Elijah said
c37419	unto them, Take the prophets of Baal;
c37420	let not one of them escape.
c37421	And they took
c37422	them: and Elijah brought them down to the brook Kishon,
c37423	and slew them there.
c37424	And Elijah said unto Ahab,
c37425	Get thee up,
c37426	eat
c37427	and drink;
c37428	for <i>there is</i> a sound of abundance of rain.
c37429	So Ahab went up
c37430	to eat
c37431	and to drink.
c37432	And Elijah went up to the top of Carmel;
c37433	and he cast himself down upon the earth,
c37434	and put his face between his knees,
c37435	And said to his servant,
c37436	Go up now,
c37437	look toward the sea.
c37438	And he went up,
c37439	and looked,
c37440	and said,
c37441	<i>There is</i> nothing.
c37442	And he said,
c37443	Go again
c37444	seven times.
c37445	And it came to pass at the seventh time,
c37446	that he said,
c37447	Behold, there ariseth a little cloud out of the sea, like a man's hand.
c37448	And he said,
c37449	Go up,
c37450	say unto Ahab,
c37451	Prepare
c37452	<i>thy chariot,</i> and get thee down,
c37453	that the rain stop thee not.
c37454	And it came to pass in the mean while,
c37455	that the heaven was black with clouds and wind,
c37456	and there was a great rain.
c37457	And Ahab rode,
c37458	and went to Jezreel.
c37459	And the hand of the LORD was on Elijah;
c37460	and he girded up his loins,
c37461	and ran before Ahab
c37462	to the entrance of Jezreel.
c37463	And Ahab told Jezebel all
c37464	that Elijah had done,
c37465	and withal
c37466	how he had slain all the prophets with the sword.
c37467	Then Jezebel sent a messenger unto Elijah,
c37468	saying,
c37469	So let the gods do
c37470	<i>to me,</i> and more also,
c37471	if I make not thy life as the life of one of them by to morrow about this time.
c37472	And when he saw
c37473	<i>that,</i> he arose,
c37474	and went for his life,
c37475	and came to Beersheba,
c37476	which <i>belongeth</i> to Judah,
c37477	and left his servant there.
c37478	But he himself went a day's journey into the wilderness,
c37479	and came
c37480	and sat down under a juniper tree:
c37481	and he requested for himself
c37482	that he might die;
c37483	and said,
c37484	It is enough; now,
c37485	O LORD,
c37486	take away my life;
c37487	for I <i>am</i> not better than my fathers.
c37488	And as he lay
c37489	and slept under a juniper tree,
c37490	behold, then
c37491	an angel touched
c37492	him, and said
c37493	unto him, Arise
c37494	<i>and</i> eat.
c37495	And he looked,
c37496	and, behold, <i>there was</i> a cake baken on the coals, and a cruse of water at his head.
c37497	And he did eat
c37498	and drink,
c37499	again.
c37500	and laid him down
c37501	And the angel of the LORD came again the second time,
c37502	and touched
c37503	him, and said,
c37504	Arise
c37505	<i>and</i> eat;
c37506	because the journey <i>is</i> too great for thee.
c37507	And he arose,
c37508	and did eat
c37509	and drink,
c37510	and went in the strength of that meat forty days and forty nights unto Horeb the mount of God.
c37511	And he came thither unto a cave,
c37512	and lodged there;
c37513	and, behold, the word of the LORD <i>came</i> to
c37514	him, and he said
c37515	unto him, What doest thou here,
c37516	Elijah?
c37517	And he said,
c37518	I have been very jealous for the LORD God of hosts:
c37519	for the children of Israel have forsaken thy covenant,
c37520	thrown down thine altars,
c37521	and slain thy prophets with the sword;
c37522	and I, <i>even</i> I only, am left;
c37523	and they seek my life,
c37524	to take it away.
c37525	And he said,
c37526	Go forth,
c37527	and stand upon the mount before the LORD.
c37528	And, behold, the LORD passed by,
c37529	and a great and strong wind
c37530	rent the mountains,
c37531	and brake in pieces the rocks
c37532	before the LORD;
c37533	<i>but</i> the LORD <i>was</i> not in the wind:
c37534	and after the wind an earthquake;
c37535	<i>but</i> the LORD <i>was</i> not in the earthquake:
c37536	And after the earthquake a fire;
c37537	<i>but</i> the LORD <i>was</i> not in the fire:
c37538	and after the fire a still small voice.
c37539	And it was
c37540	<i>so,</i> when Elijah heard
c37541	<i>it,</i> that he wrapped his face in his mantle,
c37542	and went out,
c37543	and stood in the entering in of the cave.
c37544	And, behold, <i>there came</i> a voice unto
c37545	him, and said,
c37546	What doest thou here,
c37547	Elijah?
c37548	And he said,
c37549	I have been very jealous for the LORD God of hosts:
c37550	because the children of Israel have forsaken thy covenant,
c37551	thrown down thine altars,
c37552	and slain thy prophets with the sword;
c37553	and I, <i>even</i> I only, am left;
c37554	and they seek my life,
c37555	to take it away.
c37556	And the LORD said unto
c37557	him, Go,
c37558	return on thy way to the wilderness of Damascus:
c37559	and when thou comest,
c37560	anoint Hazael <i>to be</i> king over Syria:
c37561	And Jehu the son of Nimshi shalt thou anoint <i>to be</i> king over Israel:
c37562	and Elisha the son of Shaphat of Abelmeholah shalt thou anoint <i>to be</i> prophet in thy room.
c37563	And it shall come to pass,
c37564	<i>that</i> him that escapeth the sword of Hazael
c37565	shall Jehu slay:
c37567	and him that escapeth from the sword of Jehu
c37568	shall Elisha slay.
c37569	Yet I have left <i>me</i> seven thousand in Israel,
c37570	all the knees
c37571	which have not bowed unto Baal,
c37572	and every mouth
c37573	which hath not kissed him.
c37574	So he departed thence,
c37575	and found Elisha the son of Shaphat,
c37576	who <i>was</i> plowing
c37577	<i>with</i> twelve yoke <i>of oxen</i> before
c37578	him, and he with the twelfth:
c37579	and Elijah passed by
c37580	him, and cast his mantle upon him.
c37581	And he left the oxen,
c37582	and ran after Elijah,
c37583	and said,
c37584	Let me, I pray thee, kiss my father and my mother,
c37585	and <i>then</i> I will follow
c37586	thee. And he said
c37587	unto him, Go
c37588	back again:
c37589	for what have I done to thee?
c37590	And he returned back from
c37591	him, and took a yoke of oxen,
c37592	and slew
c37593	them, and boiled their flesh with the instruments of the oxen,
c37594	and gave unto the people,
c37595	and they did eat.
c37596	Then he arose,
c37597	and went after Elijah,
c37598	and ministered unto him.
c37599	And Benhadad the king of Syria gathered all his host together: and <i>there were</i> thirty and two kings with him, and horses, and chariots:
c37600	and he went up
c37601	and besieged Samaria,
c37602	and warred against it.
c37603	And he sent messengers to Ahab king of Israel into the city,
c37604	and said
c37605	unto him, Thus saith Benhadad,
c37606	Thy silver and thy gold
c37608	<i>is</i> mine; thy wives also and thy children, <i>even</i> the goodliest, <i>are</i> mine.
c37610	And the king of Israel answered
c37611	and said,
c37612	according to thy saying,
c37613	My lord, O king,
c37614	I <i>am</i> thine, and all
c37615	that I have.
c37616	And the messengers came again,
c37617	and said,
c37618	Thus speaketh Benhadad,
c37619	saying,
c37620	Although I have sent unto
c37621	thee, saying,
c37622	Thou shalt deliver me thy silver, and thy gold, and thy wives, and thy children;
c37623	Yet I will send my servants unto thee to morrow about this time,
c37624	and they shall search thine house, and the houses of thy servants;
c37625	and it shall be,
c37626	<i>that</i> whatsoever is pleasant in thine eyes, they shall put <i>it</i> in their hand,
c37627	and take <i>it</i> away.
c37628	Then the king of Israel called all the elders of the land,
c37629	and said,
c37630	Mark, I pray you,
c37631	and see
c37632	how this <i>man</i> seeketh mischief:
c37633	for he sent unto me for my wives, and for my children, and for my silver, and for my gold;
c37634	and I denied him not.
c37635	And all the elders and all the people said unto
c37636	him, Hearken not
c37637	<i>unto him,</i> nor consent.
c37638	Wherefore he said unto the messengers of Benhadad,
c37639	Tell my lord the king,
c37640	All
c37641	that thou didst send for to thy servant at the first
c37642	I will do:
c37643	but this thing I may not
c37644	do.
c37645	And the messengers departed,
c37646	and brought him word again.
c37647	And Benhadad sent unto
c37648	him, and said,
c37649	The gods do so
c37650	unto me, and more also,
c37651	if the dust of Samaria shall suffice for handfuls for all the people
c37652	that follow me.
c37653	And the king of Israel answered
c37654	and said,
c37655	Tell
c37656	<i>him,</i> Let not him that girdeth on <i>his harness</i> boast himself
c37658	as he that putteth it off.
c37659	And it came to pass,
c37660	when <i>Benhadad</i> heard this message,
c37661	as he <i>was</i> drinking, he and the kings in the pavilions,
c37662	that he said unto his servants,
c37663	Set
c37664	<i>yourselves in array.</i> And they set <i>themselves in array</i> against the city.
c37665	And, behold,
c37666	there came a prophet unto Ahab king of Israel,
c37667	saying,
c37668	Thus saith the LORD,
c37669	Hast thou seen all this great multitude?
c37670	behold, I will deliver it into thine hand this day;
c37671	and thou shalt know
c37672	that I <i>am</i> the LORD.
c37673	And Ahab said,
c37674	By whom?
c37675	And he said,
c37676	Thus saith the LORD,
c37677	<i>Even</i> by the young men of the princes of the provinces.
c37678	Then he said,
c37679	Who shall order the battle?
c37680	And he answered,
c37681	Thou.
c37682	Then he numbered the young men of the princes of the provinces,
c37683	and they were two hundred and thirty two:
c37684	and after them he numbered all the people, <i>even</i> all the children of Israel, <i>being</i> seven thousand.
c37685	And they went out at noon.
c37686	But Benhadad <i>was</i> drinking himself drunk in the pavilions,
c37687	he and the kings, the thirty and two kings
c37688	that helped him.
c37689	And the young men of the princes of the provinces went out first;
c37690	and Benhadad sent out,
c37691	and they told
c37692	him, saying,
c37693	There are men come out of Samaria.
c37694	And he said,
c37695	Whether they be come out for peace,
c37696	take them alive;
c37697	or whether they be come out for war,
c37698	take them alive.
c37699	So these young men of the princes of the provinces came out of the city, and the army
c37700	which followed them.
c37701	And they slew every one his man:
c37702	and the Syrians fled;
c37703	and Israel pursued
c37704	them: and Benhadad the king of Syria escaped on an horse with the horsemen.
c37705	And the king of Israel went out,
c37706	and smote the horses and chariots,
c37707	and slew the Syrians with a great slaughter.
c37708	And the prophet came to the king of Israel,
c37709	and said
c37710	unto him, Go,
c37711	strengthen thyself,
c37712	and mark,
c37713	and see
c37714	what thou doest:
c37715	for at the return of the year the king of Syria will come up against thee.
c37716	And the servants of the king of Syria said unto
c37717	him, Their gods <i>are</i> gods of the hills;
c37718	therefore they were stronger than
c37719	we; but let us fight against them in the plain,
c37720	and surely we shall be stronger than they.
c37721	And do this thing,
c37722	Take the kings away,
c37723	every man out of his place,
c37724	and put captains in their rooms:
c37725	And number thee an army, like the army
c37726	that thou hast lost,
c37727	horse for horse, and chariot for chariot:
c37728	and we will fight against them in the plain,
c37729	<i>and</i> surely we shall be stronger than
c37730	they. And he hearkened unto their voice,
c37731	and did so.
c37732	And it came to pass at the return of the year,
c37733	that Benhadad numbered the Syrians,
c37734	and went up to Aphek, to fight against Israel.
c37735	And the children of Israel were numbered,
c37736	and were all present,
c37737	and went
c37738	against
c37739	them: and the children of Israel pitched before them like two little flocks of kids;
c37740	but the Syrians filled the country.
c37741	And there came a man of God,
c37742	and spake unto the king of Israel,
c37743	and said,
c37744	Thus saith the LORD,
c37745	Because the Syrians have said,
c37746	The LORD <i>is</i> God of the hills,
c37747	but he <i>is</i> not God of the valleys,
c37748	therefore will I deliver all this great multitude into thine hand,
c37749	and ye shall know
c37750	that I <i>am</i> the LORD.
c37751	And they pitched one over against the other seven days.
c37752	And <i>so</i> it was, that in the seventh day
c37753	the battle was joined:
c37754	and the children of Israel slew of the Syrians an hundred thousand footmen in one day.
c37755	But the rest fled to Aphek, into the city;
c37756	and <i>there</i> a wall fell upon twenty and seven thousand of the men
c37757	<i>that were</i> left.
c37758	And Benhadad fled,
c37759	and came into the city, into an inner chamber.
c37760	And his servants said unto
c37761	him, Behold now, we have heard
c37762	that the kings of the house of Israel
c37763	<i>are</i> merciful kings:
c37764	let us, I pray thee, put sackcloth on our loins,
c37765	and ropes upon our heads,
c37766	and go out to the king of Israel:
c37767	peradventure he will save thy life.
c37768	So they girded sackcloth on their loins,
c37769	and <i>put</i> ropes on their heads,
c37770	and came to the king of Israel,
c37771	and said,
c37772	Thy servant Benhadad saith,
c37773	I pray thee, let me live.
c37774	And he said,
c37775	<i>Is</i> he yet alive?
c37776	he <i>is</i> my brother.
c37777	Now the men did diligently observe
c37778	him, and did hastily
c37779	catch
c37780	whether <i>any thing would come</i> from
c37781	<i>it:</i> and they said,
c37782	Thy brother Benhadad.
c37783	Then he said,
c37784	Go
c37785	ye, bring
c37786	him. Then Benhadad came forth to
c37787	him; and he caused him to come up into the chariot.
c37788	And <i>Benhadad</i> said unto
c37789	him, The cities,
c37790	which my father took from thy father,
c37791	I will restore;
c37792	and thou shalt make streets for thee in Damascus,
c37793	as my father made in Samaria.
c37794	Then <i>said Ahab,</i> I will send thee away with this covenant.
c37795	So he made a covenant
c37796	with him, and sent him away.
c37797	And a certain man of the sons of the prophets said unto his neighbour in the word of the LORD,
c37798	Smite me, I pray thee.
c37799	And the man refused
c37800	to smite him.
c37801	Then said
c37802	he unto him, Because thou hast not obeyed the voice of the LORD,
c37803	behold, as soon as thou art departed from
c37804	me, a lion shall slay
c37805	thee. And as soon as he was departed from
c37806	him, a lion found
c37807	him, and slew him.
c37808	Then he found another man,
c37809	and said,
c37810	Smite me, I pray thee.
c37811	And the man smote him, so that in smiting he wounded <i>him.</i>
c37812	So the prophet departed,
c37813	and waited for the king by the way,
c37814	and disguised himself with ashes upon his face.
c37815	And as
c37816	the king passed by,
c37817	he cried unto the king:
c37818	and he said,
c37819	Thy servant went out into the midst of the battle;
c37820	and, behold, a man turned aside,
c37821	and brought a man unto
c37822	me, and said,
c37823	Keep this man:
c37824	if by any means he be missing,
c37825	then shall thy life be for his life,
c37826	or else thou shalt pay a talent of silver.
c37828	And as thy servant was busy here and there,
c37829	he
c37830	was gone.
c37831	And the king of Israel said unto
c37832	him, So <i>shall</i> thy judgment
c37833	<i>be;</i> thyself hast decided <i>it.</i>
c37834	And he hasted,
c37835	and took the ashes away from his face;
c37836	and the king of Israel discerned
c37837	him that he <i>was</i> of the prophets.
c37838	And he said unto
c37839	him, Thus saith the LORD,
c37840	Because thou hast let go out of <i>thy</i> hand a man whom I appointed to utter destruction,
c37841	therefore thy life shall go for his life,
c37842	and thy people for his people.
c37843	And the king of Israel went to his house heavy and displeased,
c37844	and came to Samaria.
c37845	And it came to pass after these things,
c37846	<i>that</i> Naboth the Jezreelite had a vineyard,
c37847	which <i>was</i> in Jezreel, hard by the palace of Ahab king of Samaria.
c37848	And Ahab spake unto Naboth,
c37849	saying,
c37850	Give me thy vineyard,
c37851	that I may have it for a garden of herbs,
c37852	because it <i>is</i> near unto my house:
c37853	and I will give thee for it a better vineyard
c37854	than
c37855	it; <i>or,</i> if it seem good to thee,
c37856	I will give thee the worth of it in money.
c37857	And Naboth said to Ahab,
c37858	The LORD forbid
c37859	it me, that I should give the inheritance of my fathers unto thee.
c37860	And Ahab came into his house
c37861	heavy and displeased because of the word
c37862	which Naboth the Jezreelite had spoken to
c37863	him: for he had said,
c37864	I will not give thee the inheritance of my fathers.
c37865	And he laid him down upon his bed,
c37866	and turned away his face,
c37867	and would eat no bread.
c37868	But Jezebel his wife came to
c37869	him, and said unto
c37870	him, Why is thy spirit so sad,
c37871	that thou eatest no bread?
c37872	And he said unto
c37873	her, Because I spake unto Naboth the Jezreelite,
c37874	and said
c37875	unto him, Give me thy vineyard for money;
c37876	or
c37877	else, if it please thee,
c37878	I will give thee <i>another</i> vineyard for
c37879	it: and he answered,
c37880	I will not give thee my vineyard.
c37881	And Jezebel his wife said unto
c37882	him, Dost thou now govern the kingdom of Israel?
c37883	arise,
c37884	<i>and</i> eat bread,
c37885	and let thine heart be merry:
c37886	I will give thee the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite.
c37887	So she wrote letters in Ahab's name,
c37888	and sealed <i>them</i> with his seal,
c37889	and sent the letters unto the elders and to the nobles
c37890	that <i>were</i> in his city,
c37891	dwelling with Naboth.
c37892	And she wrote in the letters,
c37893	saying,
c37894	Proclaim a fast,
c37895	and set Naboth on high among the people:
c37896	And set two men, sons of Belial, before
c37897	him, to bear witness against
c37898	him, saying,
c37899	Thou didst blaspheme God and the king.
c37900	And <i>then</i> carry him out,
c37901	and stone
c37902	him, that he may die.
c37903	And the men of his city, <i>even</i> the elders and the nobles who were the inhabitants in his city, did
c37905	as Jezebel had sent unto
c37906	them, <i>and</i> as it <i>was</i> written in the letters
c37907	which she had sent unto them.
c37908	They proclaimed a fast,
c37909	and set Naboth on high among the people.
c37910	And there came in two men, children of Belial,
c37911	and sat before
c37912	him: and the men of Belial witnessed against him, <i>even</i> against Naboth, in the presence of the people,
c37913	saying,
c37914	Naboth did blaspheme God and the king.
c37915	Then they carried him forth out of the city,
c37916	and stoned him with stones,
c37917	that he died.
c37918	Then they sent to Jezebel,
c37919	saying,
c37920	Naboth is stoned,
c37921	and is dead.
c37922	And it came to pass,
c37923	when Jezebel heard
c37924	that Naboth was stoned,
c37925	and was dead,
c37926	that Jezebel said to Ahab,
c37927	Arise,
c37928	take possession of the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite,
c37929	which he refused
c37930	to give thee for money:
c37931	for Naboth is not alive,
c37932	but dead.
c37933	And it came to pass,
c37934	when Ahab heard
c37935	that Naboth was dead,
c37936	that Ahab rose up
c37937	to go down to the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite,
c37938	to take possession of it.
c37939	And the word of the LORD came to Elijah the Tishbite,
c37940	saying,
c37941	Arise,
c37942	go down
c37943	to meet Ahab king of Israel,
c37944	which <i>is</i> in Samaria:
c37945	behold, <i>he is</i> in the vineyard of Naboth,
c37946	whither he is gone down
c37947	to possess it.
c37948	And thou shalt speak unto
c37949	him, saying,
c37950	Thus saith the LORD,
c37951	Hast thou killed,
c37952	and also taken possession?
c37953	And thou shalt speak unto
c37954	him, saying,
c37955	Thus saith the LORD,
c37956	In the place
c37957	where dogs licked the blood of Naboth
c37958	shall dogs lick thy blood, even thine.
c37959	And Ahab said to Elijah,
c37960	Hast thou found
c37961	me, O mine enemy?
c37962	And he answered,
c37963	I have found
c37964	<i>thee:</i> because thou hast sold
c37965	thyself to work
c37966	evil in the sight of the LORD.
c37967	Behold, I will bring evil upon
c37968	thee, and will take away thy posterity,
c37969	and will cut off from Ahab
c37970	him that pisseth against the wall,
c37971	and him that is shut up and left in Israel,
c37972	And will make thine house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah,
c37973	for the provocation
c37974	wherewith thou hast provoked <i>me</i> to anger,
c37975	and made Israel to sin.
c37976	And of Jezebel also spake the LORD,
c37977	saying,
c37978	The dogs shall eat Jezebel by the wall of Jezreel.
c37979	Him that dieth of Ahab in the city
c37980	the dogs shall eat;
c37982	and him that dieth in the field
c37983	shall the fowls of the air eat.
c37984	But there was none like unto Ahab,
c37985	which did sell himself
c37986	to work
c37987	wickedness in the sight of the LORD,
c37988	whom Jezebel his wife stirred up.
c37989	And he did very abominably
c37990	in following idols,
c37991	according to all
c37992	<i>things</i> as did the Amorites,
c37993	whom the LORD cast out before the children of Israel.
c37994	And it came to pass,
c37995	when Ahab heard those words,
c37996	that he rent his clothes,
c37997	and put sackcloth upon his flesh,
c37998	and fasted,
c37999	and lay in sackcloth,
c38000	and went softly.
c38001	And the word of the LORD came to Elijah the Tishbite,
c38002	saying,
c38003	Seest
c38004	thou how Ahab humbleth himself before
c38005	me? because he humbleth himself before
c38006	me, I will not bring the evil in his days:
c38007	<i>but</i> in his son's days will I bring the evil upon his house.
c38008	And they continued three years
c38009	without war between Syria and Israel.
c38010	And it came to pass in the third year,
c38011	that Jehoshaphat the king of Judah came down to the king of Israel.
c38012	And the king of Israel said unto his servants,
c38013	Know
c38014	ye that Ramoth in Gilead
c38015	<i>is</i> ours, and we <i>be</i> still,
c38016	<i>and</i> take it not out of the hand of the king of Syria?
c38017	And he said unto Jehoshaphat,
c38018	Wilt thou go with me to battle to Ramothgilead?
c38019	And Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel,
c38021	I <i>am</i> as thou <i>art,</i> my people as thy people,
c38022	my horses as thy horses.
c38023	And Jehoshaphat said unto the king of Israel,
c38024	Enquire, I pray thee, at the word of the LORD to day.
c38025	Then the king of Israel gathered the prophets together, about four hundred men,
c38026	and said unto
c38027	them, Shall I go against Ramothgilead to battle,
c38028	or shall I forbear?
c38029	And they said,
c38030	Go up;
c38031	for the Lord shall deliver <i>it</i> into the hand of the king.
c38032	And Jehoshaphat said,
c38033	<i>Is there</i> not here a prophet of the LORD besides,
c38034	that we might enquire of him?
c38035	And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat,
c38036	<i>There is</i> yet one man,
c38037	by whom we may enquire of the LORD:
c38038	but I hate
c38039	him; for he doth not prophesy good concerning
c38040	me, but evil.
c38041	Micaiah the son of Imlah,
c38042	And Jehoshaphat said,
c38043	Let not the king say so.
c38044	Then the king of Israel called an officer,
c38045	and said,
c38046	Hasten <i>hither</i> Micaiah the son of Imlah.
c38047	And the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah sat
c38048	each on his throne,
c38049	having put on their robes,
c38050	in a void place in the entrance of the gate of Samaria;
c38051	and all the prophets prophesied before them.
c38052	And Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah made him horns of iron:
c38053	and he said,
c38054	Thus saith the LORD,
c38055	With these shalt thou push the Syrians,
c38056	until thou have consumed them.
c38057	And all the prophets prophesied so,
c38058	saying,
c38059	Go up to Ramothgilead,
c38060	and prosper:
c38061	for the LORD shall deliver <i>it</i> into the king's hand.
c38062	And the messenger
c38063	that was gone
c38064	to call Micaiah
c38065	spake unto
c38066	him, saying,
c38067	Behold now, the words of the prophets <i>declare</i> good unto the king with one mouth:
c38068	let thy word, I pray thee, be like the word of one of them,
c38069	and speak <i>that which is</i> good.
c38070	And Micaiah said,
c38071	<i>As</i> the LORD liveth,
c38073	what the LORD saith unto
c38074	me, that will I speak.
c38075	So he came to the king.
c38076	And the king said unto
c38077	him, Micaiah,
c38078	shall we go against Ramothgilead to battle,
c38079	or shall we forbear?
c38080	And he answered
c38081	him, Go,
c38082	and prosper:
c38083	for the LORD shall deliver <i>it</i> into the hand of the king.
c38084	And the king said unto
c38085	him, How many times shall I adjure
c38086	thee that thou tell me nothing but <i>that which is</i> true in the name of the LORD?
c38087	And he said,
c38088	I saw all Israel
c38089	scattered upon the hills,
c38090	as sheep
c38091	that have not a shepherd:
c38092	and the LORD said,
c38093	These have no master:
c38094	let them return
c38095	every man to his house
c38096	in peace.
c38097	And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat,
c38098	Did I not tell
c38099	thee that he would prophesy no good concerning
c38100	me, but evil?
c38101	And he said,
c38102	Hear thou therefore the word of the LORD:
c38103	I saw the LORD
c38104	sitting on his throne,
c38105	and all the host of heaven standing by him on his right hand and on his left.
c38106	And the LORD said,
c38107	Who shall persuade Ahab,
c38108	that he may go up
c38109	and fall at Ramothgilead?
c38110	And one said on this manner,
c38111	and another said on that manner.
c38112	And there came forth a spirit,
c38113	and stood before the LORD,
c38114	and said,
c38115	I will persuade him.
c38116	And the LORD said unto
c38117	him, Wherewith?
c38118	And he said,
c38119	I will go forth,
c38120	and I will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets.
c38121	And he said,
c38122	Thou shalt persuade
c38123	<i>him,</i> and prevail also:
c38124	go forth,
c38125	and do so.
c38126	Now
c38127	therefore, behold, the LORD hath put a lying spirit in the mouth of all these thy prophets,
c38128	and the LORD hath spoken evil concerning thee.
c38129	But Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah went near,
c38130	and smote Micaiah on the cheek,
c38131	and said,
c38132	Which way went the Spirit of the LORD from me to speak unto thee?
c38134	And Micaiah said,
c38135	Behold, thou shalt see in that day,
c38136	when thou shalt go into an inner chamber
c38137	to hide thyself.
c38138	And the king of Israel said,
c38139	Take Micaiah,
c38140	and carry him back unto Amon the governor of the city, and to Joash the king's son;
c38141	And say,
c38142	Thus saith the king,
c38143	Put this <i>fellow</i> in the prison,
c38144	and feed him with bread of affliction and with water of affliction,
c38145	until I come in peace.
c38146	And Micaiah said,
c38147	If thou return at all in peace,
c38148	the LORD hath not spoken
c38149	by me. And he said,
c38150	Hearken,
c38151	O people, every one of you.
c38152	So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up to Ramothgilead.
c38153	And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat,
c38154	I will disguise myself,
c38155	and enter into the battle;
c38156	but put thou on thy robes.
c38157	And the king of Israel disguised himself,
c38158	and went into the battle.
c38159	But the king of Syria commanded his
c38161	thirty and two captains that had rule over his chariots,
c38162	saying,
c38163	Fight neither with small nor great,
c38164	save only with the king of Israel.
c38165	And it came to pass,
c38166	when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat,
c38167	that they said,
c38168	Surely it <i>is</i> the king of Israel.
c38169	And they turned aside to fight against
c38171	him: and Jehoshaphat cried out.
c38172	And it came to pass,
c38173	when the captains of the chariots perceived
c38174	that it <i>was</i> not the king of Israel,
c38175	that they turned back from pursuing him.
c38176	And a <i>certain</i> man drew a bow at a venture,
c38177	and smote the king of Israel between the joints of the harness:
c38178	wherefore he said unto the driver of his chariot,
c38179	Turn thine hand,
c38180	and carry me out of the host;
c38181	for I am wounded.
c38182	And the battle increased that day:
c38183	and the king was stayed up in his chariot against the Syrians,
c38184	and died at even:
c38185	and the blood ran out of the wound into the midst of the chariot.
c38186	And there went a proclamation throughout the host
c38187	about the going down of the sun,
c38188	saying,
c38189	Every man to his city,
c38190	and every man to his own country.
c38191	So the king died,
c38192	and was brought to Samaria;
c38193	and they buried the king in Samaria.
c38194	And <i>one</i> washed the chariot in the pool of Samaria;
c38195	and the dogs licked up his blood;
c38196	and they washed his armour;
c38197	according unto the word of the LORD
c38198	which he spake.
c38199	Now the rest of the acts of Ahab, and all
c38200	that he did,
c38201	and the ivory house
c38202	which he made,
c38203	and all the cities
c38204	that he built,
c38205	<i>are</i> they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
c38206	So Ahab slept with his fathers;
c38207	and Ahaziah his son reigned in his stead.
c38208	And Jehoshaphat the son of Asa began to reign over Judah in the fourth year of Ahab king of Israel.
c38209	Jehoshaphat <i>was</i> thirty and five years old
c38210	when he began to reign;
c38211	and he reigned twenty and five years in Jerusalem.
c38212	And his mother's name <i>was</i> Azubah the daughter of Shilhi.
c38213	And he walked in all the ways of Asa his father;
c38214	he turned not aside from
c38215	it, doing
c38216	<i>that which was</i> right in the eyes of the LORD:
c38217	nevertheless the high places were not taken away;
c38218	<i>for</i> the people offered and burnt incense yet
c38219	in the high places.
c38220	And Jehoshaphat made peace with the king of Israel.
c38221	Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, and his might
c38222	that he shewed,
c38223	and how he warred,
c38224	<i>are</i> they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
c38225	And the remnant of the sodomites,
c38226	which remained in the days of his father Asa,
c38227	he took out of the land.
c38228	<i>There was</i> then no king in Edom:
c38229	a deputy <i>was</i> king.
c38230	Jehoshaphat made ships of Tharshish
c38231	to go to Ophir for gold:
c38232	but they went not;
c38233	for the ships were broken at Eziongeber.
c38234	Then said Ahaziah the son of Ahab unto Jehoshaphat,
c38235	Let my servants go with thy servants in the ships.
c38236	But Jehoshaphat would not.
c38237	And Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers,
c38238	and was buried with his fathers in the city of David his father:
c38239	and Jehoram his son reigned in his stead.
c38240	Ahaziah the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria the seventeenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah,
c38241	and reigned two years over Israel.
c38242	And he did
c38243	evil in the sight of the LORD,
c38244	and walked in the way of his father, and in the way of his mother, and in the way of Jeroboam the son of Nebat,
c38245	who made Israel to sin:
c38246	For he served Baal,
c38247	and worshipped
c38248	him, and provoked to anger the LORD God of Israel, according to all
c38249	that his father had done.
c38250	Then Moab rebelled against Israel after the death of Ahab.
c38251	And Ahaziah fell down through a lattice in his upper chamber
c38252	that <i>was</i> in Samaria,
c38253	and was sick:
c38254	and he sent messengers,
c38255	and said unto
c38256	them, Go,
c38257	enquire of Baalzebub the god of Ekron
c38258	whether I shall recover of this disease.
c38259	But the angel of the LORD said to Elijah the Tishbite,
c38260	Arise,
c38261	go up
c38262	to meet the messengers of the king of Samaria,
c38263	and say unto
c38264	them, <i>Is it</i> not because <i>there is</i> not a God in Israel,
c38265	<i>that</i> ye go
c38266	to enquire of Baalzebub the god of Ekron?
c38267	Now therefore
c38268	thus saith the LORD,
c38269	that bed
c38270	on which thou art gone up,
c38271	Thou shalt not come down from
c38272	but shalt surely die.
c38273	And Elijah departed.
c38274	And when the messengers turned back unto
c38275	him, he said unto
c38276	them, Why are ye now turned back?
c38277	And they said unto
c38278	him, There came a man
c38279	up to meet
c38280	us, and said unto
c38281	us, Go,
c38282	turn again unto the king
c38283	that sent
c38284	you, and say unto
c38285	him, Thus saith the LORD,
c38286	<i>Is it</i> not because <i>there is</i> not a God in Israel,
c38287	<i>that</i> thou sendest
c38288	to enquire of Baalzebub the god of Ekron?
c38289	therefore
c38290	that bed
c38291	on which thou art gone up,
c38292	thou shalt not come down from
c38293	but shalt surely die.
c38294	And he said unto
c38295	them, What manner of man
c38296	<i>was he</i> which came up
c38297	to meet
c38298	you, and told you these words?
c38299	And they answered
c38300	him, <i>He was</i> an hairy man,
c38301	and girt with a girdle of leather about his loins.
c38302	And he said,
c38303	It <i>is</i> Elijah the Tishbite.
c38304	Then the king sent unto him a captain of fifty with his fifty.
c38305	And he went up to
c38306	him: and, behold, he sat on the top of an hill.
c38307	And he spake unto
c38308	him, Thou man of God,
c38309	the king hath said,
c38310	Come down.
c38311	And Elijah answered
c38312	and said to the captain of fifty,
c38313	If I <i>be</i> a man of God,
c38314	then let fire come down from heaven,
c38315	and consume thee and thy fifty.
c38316	And there came down fire from heaven,
c38317	and consumed him and his fifty.
c38318	Again
c38319	also he sent unto him another captain of fifty with his fifty.
c38320	And he answered
c38321	and said unto
c38322	him, O man of God,
c38323	thus hath the king said,
c38324	Come down quickly.
c38325	And Elijah answered
c38326	and said unto
c38327	them, If I <i>be</i> a man of God,
c38328	let fire come down from heaven,
c38329	and consume thee and thy fifty.
c38330	And the fire of God came down from heaven,
c38331	and consumed him and his fifty.
c38333	And he sent again a captain of the third fifty with his fifty.
c38335	And the third captain of fifty went up, and came
c38336	and fell on his knees before Elijah,
c38337	and besought
c38338	him, and said unto
c38339	him, O man of God,
c38340	I pray thee, let my life, and the life of these fifty thy servants, be precious in thy sight.
c38341	Behold, there came fire down from heaven,
c38342	and burnt up the two captains of the former fifties with their fifties:
c38344	therefore let my life now be precious in thy sight.
c38345	And the angel of the LORD said unto Elijah,
c38346	Go down with
c38347	him: be not afraid of
c38348	him. And he arose,
c38349	and went down with him unto the king.
c38350	And he said unto
c38351	him, Thus saith the LORD,
c38352	Forasmuch as thou hast sent messengers
c38353	to enquire of Baalzebub the god of Ekron,
c38354	<i>is it</i> not because <i>there is</i> no God in Israel
c38355	to enquire of his word?
c38356	therefore
c38357	that bed
c38358	on which thou art gone up,
c38359	thou shalt not come down off
c38360	but shalt surely die.
c38361	So he died according to the word of the LORD
c38362	which Elijah had spoken.
c38363	And Jehoram reigned in his stead in the second year of Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat king of Judah;
c38364	because he had no son.
c38365	Now the rest of the acts of Ahaziah
c38366	which he did,
c38367	<i>are</i> they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
c38368	And it came to pass,
c38369	when the LORD would take up Elijah into heaven by a whirlwind,
c38370	that Elijah went with Elisha from Gilgal.
c38371	And Elijah said unto Elisha,
c38372	Tarry here, I pray thee;
c38373	for the LORD hath sent me to Bethel.
c38374	And Elisha said
c38375	<i>unto him, As</i> the LORD liveth,
c38376	and <i>as</i> thy soul liveth,
c38377	I will not leave
c38378	thee. So they went down to Bethel.
c38379	And the sons of the prophets that <i>were</i> at Bethel came forth
c38381	to Elisha,
c38382	and said unto
c38383	him, Knowest
c38384	thou that the LORD will take away thy master from thy head to day?
c38385	And he said,
c38386	Yea, I know
c38387	<i>it;</i> hold ye your peace.
c38388	And Elijah said
c38389	unto him, Elisha,
c38390	tarry here, I pray thee;
c38391	for the LORD hath sent me to Jericho.
c38392	And he said,
c38393	<i>As</i> the LORD liveth,
c38394	and <i>as</i> thy soul liveth,
c38395	I will not leave
c38396	thee. So they came to Jericho.
c38397	And the sons of the prophets that <i>were</i> at Jericho came
c38399	to Elisha,
c38400	and said unto
c38401	him, Knowest
c38402	thou that the LORD will take away thy master from thy head to day?
c38403	And he answered,
c38404	Yea, I know
c38405	<i>it;</i> hold ye your peace.
c38406	And Elijah said
c38407	unto him, Tarry, I pray thee, here;
c38408	for the LORD hath sent me to Jordan.
c38409	And he said,
c38410	<i>As</i> the LORD liveth,
c38411	and <i>as</i> thy soul liveth,
c38412	I will not leave
c38413	thee. And they two went on.
c38414	And fifty men of the sons of the prophets went,
c38415	and stood to view afar off:
c38416	and they two stood by Jordan.
c38417	And Elijah took his mantle,
c38418	and wrapped <i>it</i> together,
c38419	and smote the waters,
c38420	and they were divided hither and thither,
c38421	so that they two went over on dry ground.
c38422	And it came to pass,
c38423	when they were gone over,
c38424	that Elijah said unto Elisha,
c38425	Ask
c38426	what I shall do
c38427	for thee, before I be taken away from
c38428	thee. And Elisha said,
c38429	I pray thee, let a double portion of thy spirit be upon me.
c38430	And he said,
c38431	a hard thing:
c38432	Thou hast asked
c38433	<i>nevertheless,</i> if thou see
c38434	me <i>when I am</i> taken from
c38435	thee, it shall be so
c38436	unto thee; but if not,
c38437	it shall not be <i>so.</i>
c38438	And it came to pass,
c38439	as they still went on, and talked,
c38440	that, behold, <i>there appeared</i> a chariot of fire, and horses of fire,
c38441	and parted them both asunder;
c38442	and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven.
c38443	And Elisha saw
c38444	<i>it,</i> and he cried,
c38445	My father, my father,
c38446	the chariot of Israel, and the horsemen
c38447	thereof. And he saw him no more:
c38448	and he took hold of his own clothes,
c38449	and rent them in two pieces.
c38450	He took up also the mantle of Elijah
c38451	that fell from
c38452	him, and went back,
c38453	and stood by the bank of Jordan;
c38454	And he took the mantle of Elijah
c38455	that fell from
c38456	him, and smote the waters,
c38457	and said,
c38458	Where <i>is</i> the LORD God of Elijah? and when he also
c38459	had smitten the waters,
c38460	they parted hither and thither:
c38461	and Elisha went over.
c38462	And when the sons of the prophets which
c38463	at Jericho saw
c38464	<i>were</i> to view
c38465	him, they said,
c38466	The spirit of Elijah doth rest on Elisha.
c38467	And they came
c38468	to meet
c38469	him, and bowed themselves to the ground before him.
c38470	And they said unto
c38471	him, Behold now, there be with thy servants fifty strong men;
c38472	let them go, we pray thee,
c38473	and seek thy master:
c38474	lest peradventure the Spirit of the LORD hath taken him up,
c38475	and cast him upon some mountain, or into some valley.
c38476	And he said,
c38477	Ye shall not send.
c38478	And when they urged
c38479	him till he was ashamed,
c38480	he said,
c38481	Send.
c38482	They sent therefore fifty men;
c38483	and they sought three days,
c38484	but found him not.
c38485	And when they came again to
c38486	him, (for he tarried at Jericho,)
c38487	he said unto
c38488	them, Did I not say unto
c38489	you, Go not?
c38490	And the men of the city said unto Elisha,
c38491	Behold, I pray thee, the situation of this city <i>is</i> pleasant,
c38492	as my lord seeth:
c38493	but the water <i>is</i> naught,
c38494	and the ground barren.
c38495	And he said,
c38496	Bring me a new cruse,
c38497	and put salt therein.
c38498	And they brought <i>it</i> to him.
c38499	And he went forth unto the spring of the waters,
c38500	and cast the salt in there,
c38501	and said,
c38502	Thus saith the LORD,
c38503	I have healed these waters;
c38504	there shall not be from thence any more death or barren <i>land.</i>
c38505	So the waters were healed unto this day, according to the saying of Elisha
c38506	which he spake.
c38507	And he went up from thence unto Bethel:
c38508	and as he was going up by the way,
c38509	there came forth little children out of the city,
c38510	and mocked
c38511	him, and said
c38512	unto him, Go up,
c38513	thou bald head;
c38514	go up,
c38515	thou bald head.
c38516	And he turned back,
c38517	and looked
c38518	on them, and cursed them in the name of the LORD.
c38519	And there came forth two she bears out of the wood,
c38520	and tare forty and two children of them.
c38521	And he went from thence to mount Carmel,
c38522	and from thence he returned to Samaria.
c38523	Now Jehoram the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria the eighteenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah,
c38524	and reigned twelve years.
c38525	And he wrought
c38526	evil in the sight of the LORD;
c38527	but not like his father, and like his mother:
c38528	for he put away the image of Baal
c38529	that his father had made.
c38530	Nevertheless he cleaved unto the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat,
c38531	which made Israel to sin;
c38533	he departed not therefrom.
c38534	And Mesha king of Moab was a sheepmaster,
c38535	and rendered unto the king of Israel an hundred thousand lambs, and an hundred thousand rams, with the wool.
c38536	But it came to pass, when Ahab was dead,
c38537	that the king of Moab rebelled against the king of Israel.
c38538	And king Jehoram went out of Samaria the same time,
c38539	and numbered all Israel.
c38540	And he went
c38541	and sent to Jehoshaphat the king of Judah,
c38542	saying,
c38543	The king of Moab hath rebelled
c38544	against me: wilt thou go with me against Moab to battle?
c38545	And he said,
c38546	I will go up:
c38548	I <i>am</i> as thou <i>art,</i> my people as thy people,
c38549	<i>and</i> my horses as thy horses.
c38550	And he said,
c38551	Which way
c38552	shall we go up?
c38553	And he answered,
c38554	The way through the wilderness of Edom.
c38555	So the king of Israel went, and the king of Judah, and the king of Edom:
c38556	and they fetched a compass of seven days' journey:
c38557	and there was no water for the host, and for the cattle
c38558	that followed them.
c38559	And the king of Israel said,
c38560	Alas!
c38561	that the LORD hath called these three kings
c38562	together, to deliver them into the hand of Moab!
c38563	But Jehoshaphat said,
c38564	<i>Is there</i> not here a prophet of the LORD,
c38565	that we may enquire of the LORD by
c38566	him? And one of the king of Israel's servants answered
c38567	and said,
c38568	Here <i>is</i> Elisha the son of Shaphat,
c38569	which poured water on the hands of Elijah.
c38570	And Jehoshaphat said,
c38571	The word of the LORD is with
c38572	him. So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat and the king of Edom went down to him.
c38573	And Elisha said unto the king of Israel,
c38574	What
c38575	have I to do with thee? get thee to the prophets of thy father, and to the prophets of thy mother.
c38576	And the king of Israel said
c38577	unto him, Nay:
c38578	for the LORD hath called these three kings
c38579	together, to deliver them into the hand of Moab.
c38580	And Elisha said,
c38581	<i>As</i> the LORD of hosts liveth,
c38582	before whom I stand,
c38583	surely, were it not that I regard the presence of Jehoshaphat the king of Judah,
c38584	I would not look toward thee, nor
c38585	see thee.
c38586	But now
c38587	bring me a minstrel.
c38588	And it came to pass,
c38589	when the minstrel played,
c38590	that the hand of the LORD came upon him.
c38591	And he said,
c38592	Thus saith the LORD,
c38593	Make this valley full of ditches.
c38594	For thus saith the LORD,
c38595	Ye shall not see wind,
c38596	neither shall ye see rain;
c38597	yet that valley shall be filled with water,
c38598	that ye may drink, both ye, and your cattle, and your beasts.
c38599	And this is <i>but</i> a light thing in the sight of the LORD:
c38600	he will deliver the Moabites also into your hand.
c38601	And ye shall smite every fenced city, and every choice city,
c38602	and shall fell every good tree,
c38603	and stop all wells of water,
c38604	and mar every good piece of land with stones.
c38605	And it came to pass in the morning,
c38606	when the meat offering was offered,
c38607	that, behold, there came water by the way of Edom,
c38608	and the country was filled with water.
c38609	And when all the Moabites heard
c38610	that the kings were come up
c38611	to fight
c38612	against them, they gathered all that were able to put on armour, and upward,
c38613	and stood in the border.
c38614	And they rose up early in the morning,
c38615	and the sun shone upon the water,
c38616	and the Moabites saw the water on the other side
c38617	<i>as</i> red as blood:
c38618	And they said,
c38619	This <i>is</i> blood:
c38620	the kings are surely slain,
c38621	and they have smitten
c38622	one another:
c38623	now therefore, Moab, to the spoil.
c38625	And when they came to the camp of Israel,
c38626	the Israelites rose up
c38627	and smote the Moabites,
c38628	so that they fled before
c38629	them: but they went
c38630	forward smiting the Moabites, even in <i>their</i> country.
c38631	And they beat down the cities,
c38632	and on every good piece of land cast every man his stone,
c38633	and filled
c38634	it; and they stopped all the wells of water,
c38635	and felled all the good trees:
c38636	only in Kirharaseth left they the stones
c38637	thereof; howbeit the slingers went about
c38638	<i>it,</i> and smote it.
c38639	And when the king of Moab saw
c38640	that the battle was too sore for
c38641	him, he took with him seven hundred men that drew swords,
c38642	to break through <i>even</i> unto the king of Edom:
c38643	but they could not.
c38644	Then he took his eldest son
c38645	that should have reigned in his stead,
c38646	and offered him <i>for</i> a burnt offering upon the wall.
c38647	And there was great indignation against Israel:
c38648	and they departed from
c38649	him, and returned to <i>their own</i> land.
c38650	Now there cried a certain woman of the wives of the sons of the prophets unto Elisha,
c38651	saying,
c38652	Thy servant my husband is dead;
c38653	and thou knowest
c38654	that thy servant did fear the LORD:
c38655	and the creditor is come
c38656	to take unto him my two sons to be bondmen.
c38657	And Elisha said unto
c38658	her, What shall I do
c38659	for thee? tell
c38660	me, what hast thou in the house?
c38661	And she said,
c38662	Thine handmaid hath not any thing in the house,
c38663	save a pot of oil.
c38664	Then he said,
c38665	Go,
c38666	borrow thee vessels abroad of all thy neighbours, <i>even</i> empty vessels;
c38667	borrow not a few.
c38668	And when thou art come in,
c38669	thou shalt shut the door upon thee and upon thy sons,
c38670	and shalt pour out into all those vessels,
c38671	and thou shalt set aside that which is full.
c38672	So she went from
c38673	him, and shut the door upon her and upon her sons,
c38674	who brought <i>the vessels</i> to
c38675	her; and she poured out.
c38676	And it came to pass,
c38677	when the vessels were full,
c38678	that she said unto her son,
c38679	Bring me yet a vessel.
c38680	And he said unto
c38681	her, <i>There is</i> not a vessel more.
c38682	And the oil stayed.
c38683	Then she came
c38684	and told the man of God.
c38685	And he said,
c38686	Go,
c38687	sell the oil,
c38688	and pay thy debt,
c38689	and live thou and thy children of the rest.
c38690	And it fell on a day,
c38691	that Elisha passed to Shunem,
c38692	where <i>was</i> a great woman;
c38693	and she constrained
c38694	him to eat bread.
c38695	And <i>so</i> it was,
c38696	<i>that</i> as oft as he passed by,
c38697	he turned in thither
c38698	to eat bread.
c38699	And she said unto her husband,
c38700	Behold now, I perceive
c38701	that this <i>is</i> an holy man of God,
c38703	which passeth by us continually.
c38704	Let us make a little chamber, I pray thee, on the wall;
c38705	and let us set for him there a bed, and a table, and a stool, and a candlestick:
c38706	and it shall be,
c38707	when he cometh to
c38708	us, that he shall turn in thither.
c38709	And it fell on a day,
c38710	that he came thither,
c38711	and he turned into the chamber,
c38712	and lay there.
c38713	And he said to Gehazi his servant,
c38714	Call this Shunammite.
c38715	And when he had called
c38716	her, she stood before him.
c38717	And he said
c38718	unto him, Say now unto
c38719	her, Behold, thou hast been careful for us with all this care;
c38720	what
c38721	<i>is</i> to be done
c38722	for thee? wouldest
c38723	thou be spoken for to the king, or to the captain of the host?
c38724	And she answered,
c38725	I dwell among mine own people.
c38726	And he said,
c38727	What
c38728	then <i>is</i> to be done
c38729	for her? And Gehazi answered,
c38730	Verily she hath no child,
c38731	and her husband is old.
c38732	And he said,
c38733	Call
c38734	her. And when he had called
c38735	her, she stood in the door.
c38736	And he said,
c38737	About this season, according to the time of life, thou shalt embrace a son.
c38738	And she said,
c38739	Nay,
c38740	my lord, <i>thou</i> man of God,
c38741	do not lie unto thine handmaid.
c38742	And the woman conceived,
c38743	and bare a son at that season that Elisha had said unto her, according to the time of life.
c38745	And when the child was grown,
c38746	it fell on a day,
c38747	that he went out to his father to the reapers.
c38748	And he said unto his father,
c38749	My head,
c38750	my head.
c38751	And he said to a lad,
c38752	Carry him to his mother.
c38753	And when he had taken
c38754	him, and brought him to his mother,
c38755	he sat on her knees till noon,
c38756	and <i>then</i> died.
c38757	And she went up,
c38758	and laid him on the bed of the man of God,
c38759	and shut <i>the door</i> upon
c38760	him, and went out.
c38761	And she called unto her husband,
c38762	and said,
c38763	Send me, I pray thee, one of the young men, and one of the asses,
c38764	that I may run to the man of God,
c38765	and come again.
c38766	And he said,
c38767	Wherefore wilt thou go to him to day?
c38768	<i>it is</i> neither new moon,
c38769	nor sabbath.
c38770	And she said,
c38771	<i>It shall be</i> well.
c38772	Then she saddled an ass,
c38773	and said to her servant,
c38774	Drive,
c38775	and go forward;
c38776	slack not
c38777	<i>thy</i> riding
c38778	for me, except I bid thee.
c38779	So she went
c38780	and came unto the man of God to mount Carmel.
c38781	And it came to pass,
c38782	when the man of God saw her afar off,
c38783	that he said to Gehazi his servant,
c38784	Behold, <i>yonder is</i> that Shunammite:
c38785	Run now, I pray thee,
c38786	to meet
c38787	her, and say
c38788	unto her, <i>Is it</i> well
c38789	with thee? <i>is it</i> well with thy husband?
c38790	<i>is it</i> well with the child?
c38791	And she answered,
c38792	<i>It is</i> well.
c38793	And when she came to the man of God to the hill,
c38794	she caught him by the feet:
c38795	but Gehazi came near
c38796	to thrust her away.
c38797	And the man of God said,
c38798	Let her alone;
c38799	for her soul <i>is</i> vexed
c38800	within her: and the LORD hath hid <i>it</i> from
c38801	me, and hath not told me.
c38802	Then she said,
c38803	Did I desire a son of my lord?
c38804	did I not say,
c38805	Do not deceive me?
c38806	Then he said to Gehazi,
c38807	Gird up thy loins,
c38808	and take my staff in thine hand,
c38809	and go thy way:
c38810	if thou meet any man,
c38811	salute him not;
c38812	and if any salute
c38813	thee, answer him not
c38814	again: and lay my staff upon the face of the child.
c38815	And the mother of the child said,
c38816	<i>As</i> the LORD liveth,
c38817	and <i>as</i> thy soul liveth,
c38818	I will not leave
c38819	thee. And he arose,
c38820	and followed her.
c38821	And Gehazi passed on before
c38822	them, and laid the staff upon the face of the child;
c38823	but <i>there was</i> neither voice,
c38824	nor hearing.
c38825	Wherefore he went again
c38826	to meet
c38827	him, and told
c38828	him, saying,
c38829	The child is not awaked.
c38830	And when Elisha was come into the house,
c38831	behold, the child was dead,
c38832	<i>and</i> laid upon his bed.
c38833	He went in
c38834	therefore, and shut the door upon them twain,
c38835	and prayed unto the LORD.
c38836	And he went up,
c38837	and lay upon the child,
c38838	and put his mouth upon his mouth,
c38839	and his eyes upon his eyes,
c38840	and his hands upon his hands:
c38841	and he stretched himself upon
c38842	the child; and the flesh of the child waxed warm.
c38843	Then he returned,
c38844	and walked in the house to and fro;
c38845	and went up,
c38846	and stretched himself upon
c38847	him: and the child sneezed seven times,
c38848	and the child opened his eyes.
c38849	And he called Gehazi,
c38850	and said,
c38851	Call this Shunammite.
c38852	So he called
c38853	her. And when she was come in unto
c38854	him, he said,
c38855	Take up thy son.
c38856	Then she went in,
c38857	and fell at his feet,
c38858	and bowed herself to the ground,
c38859	and took up her son,
c38860	and went out.
c38861	And Elisha came again to Gilgal:
c38862	and <i>there was</i> a dearth in the land;
c38863	and the sons of the prophets <i>were</i> sitting before
c38864	him: and he said unto his servant,
c38865	Set on the great pot,
c38866	and seethe pottage for the sons of the prophets.
c38867	And one went out into the field
c38868	to gather herbs,
c38869	and found a wild vine,
c38870	and gathered thereof wild gourds his lap full,
c38871	and came
c38872	and shred <i>them</i> into the pot of pottage:
c38873	for they knew <i>them</i> not.
c38874	So they poured out for the men
c38875	to eat.
c38876	And it came to pass,
c38877	as they were eating of the pottage,
c38878	that they cried out,
c38879	and said,
c38880	<i>there is</i> death in the pot.
c38881	O <i>thou</i> man of God,
c38882	And they could not
c38883	eat <i>thereof.</i>
c38884	But he said,
c38885	Then bring meal.
c38886	And he cast <i>it</i> into the pot;
c38887	and he said,
c38888	Pour out for the people,
c38889	that they may eat.
c38890	And there was no harm in the pot.
c38891	And there came a man from Baalshalisha,
c38892	and brought the man of God bread of the firstfruits, twenty loaves of barley, and full ears of corn in the husk
c38893	thereof. And he said,
c38894	Give unto the people,
c38895	that they may eat.
c38896	And his servitor said,
c38897	What, should I set this before an hundred men?
c38898	He said
c38899	again, Give the people,
c38900	that they may eat:
c38901	for thus saith the LORD,
c38902	They shall eat,
c38903	and shall leave <i>thereof.</i>
c38904	So he set <i>it</i> before
c38905	them, and they did eat,
c38906	and left <i>thereof,</i> according to the word of the LORD.
c38907	Now Naaman, captain of the host of the king of Syria, was a great man with his master,
c38908	and honourable,
c38909	because by him the LORD had given deliverance unto Syria:
c38910	he was also a mighty man in valour,
c38911	<i>but he was</i> a leper.
c38912	And the Syrians had gone out by companies,
c38913	and had brought away captive out of the land of Israel a little maid;
c38914	and she waited on Naaman's wife.
c38915	And she said unto her mistress,
c38916	Would God my lord <i>were</i> with the prophet
c38917	that <i>is</i> in Samaria!
c38918	for he would recover him of his leprosy.
c38919	And <i>one</i> went in,
c38920	and told his lord,
c38921	saying,
c38922	Thus and thus said the maid
c38923	that <i>is</i> of the land of Israel.
c38924	And the king of Syria said,
c38925	Go to,
c38926	go,
c38927	and I will send a letter unto the king of Israel.
c38928	And he departed,
c38929	and took with him ten talents of silver, and six thousand <i>pieces</i> of gold, and ten changes of raiment.
c38930	And he brought the letter to the king of Israel,
c38931	saying,
c38932	Now
c38933	when this letter is come unto
c38934	thee, behold, I have <i>therewith</i> sent Naaman my servant to
c38935	thee, that thou mayest recover him of his leprosy.
c38936	And it came to pass,
c38937	when the king of Israel had read the letter,
c38938	that he rent his clothes,
c38939	and said,
c38940	<i>Am</i> I God,
c38941	to kill
c38942	and to make alive,
c38943	that this man doth send unto
c38944	me to recover a man of his leprosy?
c38945	wherefore consider, I pray you,
c38946	and see
c38947	how he seeketh a quarrel against me.
c38948	And it was
c38949	<i>so,</i> when Elisha the man of God had heard
c38950	that the king of Israel had rent his clothes,
c38951	that he sent to the king,
c38952	saying,
c38953	Wherefore hast thou rent thy clothes?
c38954	let him come now to
c38955	me, and he shall know
c38956	that there is a prophet in Israel.
c38957	So Naaman came with his horses and with his chariot,
c38958	and stood at the door of the house of Elisha.
c38959	And Elisha sent a messenger unto
c38960	him, saying,
c38961	Go
c38962	and wash in Jordan seven times,
c38963	and thy flesh shall come again
c38964	to thee, and thou shalt be clean.
c38965	But Naaman was wroth,
c38966	and went away,
c38967	and said,
c38968	Behold, I thought, He will surely come out to
c38970	me, and stand,
c38971	and call on the name of the LORD his God,
c38972	and strike his hand over the place,
c38973	and recover the leper.
c38974	<i>Are</i> not Abana and Pharpar, rivers of Damascus, better than all the waters of Israel?
c38975	may I not wash
c38976	in them, and be clean?
c38977	So he turned
c38978	and went away in a rage.
c38979	And his servants came near,
c38980	and spake unto
c38981	him, and said,
c38982	My father,
c38983	<i>if</i> the prophet had bid thee <i>do some</i> great thing,
c38984	wouldest thou not have done
c38985	<i>it?</i> how much rather then, when he saith to
c38986	thee, Wash,
c38987	and be clean?
c38988	Then went he down,
c38989	and dipped himself seven times in Jordan, according to the saying of the man of God:
c38990	and his flesh came again like unto the flesh of a little child,
c38991	and he was clean.
c38992	And he returned to the man of God, he and all his company,
c38993	and came,
c38994	and stood before
c38995	him: and he said,
c38996	Behold, now I know
c38997	that <i>there is</i> no God in all the earth,
c38998	but in Israel:
c38999	now therefore, I pray thee, take a blessing of thy servant.
c39000	But he said,
c39001	<i>As</i> the LORD liveth,
c39002	before whom I stand,
c39003	I will receive
c39004	none. And he urged
c39005	him to take
c39006	<i>it;</i> but he refused.
c39007	And Naaman said,
c39008	Shall there not
c39009	then, I pray thee, be given to thy servant two mules' burden of earth?
c39010	for thy servant will henceforth offer neither burnt offering nor sacrifice unto other gods,
c39011	but unto the LORD.
c39012	In this thing the LORD pardon thy servant,
c39013	<i>that</i> when my master goeth into the house of Rimmon
c39014	to worship there,
c39015	and he leaneth on my hand,
c39016	and I bow myself in the house of Rimmon:
c39017	when I bow down myself in the house of Rimmon,
c39018	the LORD pardon thy servant in this thing.
c39019	And he said
c39020	unto him, Go in peace.
c39021	So he departed from him a little way.
c39022	But Gehazi, the servant of Elisha the man of God, said,
c39023	Behold, my master hath spared Naaman this Syrian,
c39024	in not receiving at his hands
c39025	that which he brought:
c39027	but, <i>as</i> the LORD liveth, I will run after
c39028	him, and take somewhat of him.
c39029	So Gehazi followed after Naaman.
c39030	And when Naaman saw
c39031	<i>him</i> running after
c39032	him, he lighted down from the chariot
c39033	to meet
c39034	him, and said,
c39035	<i>Is</i> all well?
c39036	And he said,
c39037	All <i>is</i> well.
c39038	My master hath sent
c39039	me, saying,
c39040	Behold, even now
c39041	there be come to me from mount Ephraim two young men of the sons of the prophets:
c39042	give them, I pray thee, a talent of silver, and two changes of garments.
c39043	And Naaman said,
c39044	Be content,
c39045	take two talents.
c39046	And he urged
c39047	him, and bound two talents of silver in two bags, with two changes of garments,
c39048	and laid <i>them</i> upon two of his servants;
c39049	and they bare <i>them</i> before him.
c39050	And when he came to the tower,
c39051	he took <i>them</i> from their hand,
c39052	and bestowed <i>them</i> in the house:
c39053	and he let the men go,
c39054	and they departed.
c39055	But he went in,
c39056	and stood before his master.
c39057	And Elisha said unto
c39058	him, Whence <i>comest thou,</i> Gehazi?
c39060	And he said,
c39061	Thy servant went no whither.
c39062	And he said unto
c39063	him, Went not mine heart
c39064	<i>with thee,</i> when the man turned again from his chariot
c39065	to meet
c39066	thee? <i>Is it</i> a time
c39067	to receive money,
c39068	and to receive garments, and oliveyards, and vineyards, and sheep, and oxen, and menservants, and maidservants?
c39069	The leprosy therefore of Naaman shall cleave unto thee, and unto thy seed for ever.
c39070	And he went out from his presence
c39071	a leper <i>as white</i> as snow.
c39072	And the sons of the prophets said unto Elisha,
c39073	Behold now, the place
c39074	where we dwell with
c39075	thee is too strait for us.
c39076	Let us go, we pray thee, unto Jordan,
c39077	and take thence
c39078	every man a beam,
c39079	and let us make us a place there,
c39080	where we may dwell.
c39081	And he answered,
c39082	Go ye.
c39083	And one said,
c39084	Be content, I pray thee,
c39085	and go with thy servants.
c39086	And he answered,
c39087	I will go.
c39088	So he went with
c39089	them. And when they came to Jordan,
c39090	they cut down wood.
c39092	But as one was felling a beam,
c39093	the axe head fell into the water:
c39094	and he cried,
c39095	and said,
c39096	Alas, master!
c39097	for it was borrowed.
c39098	And the man of God said,
c39099	Where fell
c39100	it? And he shewed him the place.
c39101	And he cut down a stick,
c39102	and cast <i>it</i> in thither;
c39103	and the iron did swim.
c39104	Therefore said
c39105	he, Take <i>it</i> up
c39106	to thee. And he put out his hand,
c39107	and took it.
c39108	Then the king of Syria
c39109	warred against Israel,
c39110	and took counsel with his servants,
c39111	saying,
c39112	In such and such a place <i>shall be</i> my camp.
c39113	And the man of God sent unto the king of Israel,
c39114	saying,
c39115	Beware
c39116	that thou pass not such a place;
c39117	for thither the Syrians are come down.
c39118	And the king of Israel sent to the place
c39119	which the man of God told
c39120	him and warned
c39121	him of, and saved himself there,
c39122	not once
c39123	nor twice.
c39124	Therefore the heart of the king of Syria was sore troubled for this thing;
c39125	and he called his servants,
c39126	and said unto
c39127	them, Will ye not shew
c39128	me which
c39129	of
c39130	us <i>is</i> for the king of Israel?
c39131	And one of his servants said,
c39132	None,
c39133	my lord, O king:
c39134	but Elisha, the prophet
c39135	that <i>is</i> in Israel,
c39136	telleth the king of Israel the words
c39137	that thou speakest in thy bedchamber.
c39138	And he said,
c39139	Go
c39140	and spy
c39141	where he
c39142	<i>is,</i> that I may send
c39143	and fetch
c39144	him. And it was told
c39145	him, saying,
c39146	Behold, <i>he is</i> in Dothan.
c39147	Therefore sent he thither horses, and chariots, and a great host:
c39148	and they came by night,
c39149	and compassed the city about.
c39150	And when the servant of the man of God was risen early,
c39152	and gone forth,
c39153	behold, an host compassed the city both with horses and chariots.
c39154	And his servant said unto
c39155	him, Alas, my master!
c39156	how shall we do?
c39157	And he answered,
c39158	Fear not:
c39159	for they that <i>be</i> with us <i>are</i> more
c39161	than they that <i>be</i> with them.
c39162	And Elisha prayed,
c39163	and said,
c39164	LORD,
c39165	I pray thee, open his eyes,
c39166	that he may see.
c39167	And the LORD opened the eyes of the young man;
c39168	and he saw:
c39169	and, behold, the mountain <i>was</i> full of horses and chariots of fire round about Elisha.
c39170	And when they came down to
c39171	him, Elisha prayed unto the LORD,
c39172	and said,
c39173	Smite this people, I pray thee, with blindness.
c39174	And he smote them with blindness according to the word of Elisha.
c39175	And Elisha said unto
c39176	them, This <i>is</i> not the way,
c39177	neither <i>is</i> this the city:
c39178	follow
c39179	me, and I will bring you to the man
c39180	whom ye seek.
c39181	But he led them to Samaria.
c39182	And it came to pass,
c39183	when they were come into Samaria,
c39184	that Elisha said,
c39185	LORD,
c39186	open the eyes of these
c39187	<i>men,</i> that they may see.
c39188	And the LORD opened their eyes,
c39189	and they saw;
c39190	and, behold, <i>they were</i> in the midst of Samaria.
c39191	And the king of Israel said unto Elisha,
c39192	when he saw
c39193	shall I smite
c39194	<i>them?</i> shall I smite <i>them?</i>
c39195	them, My father,
c39196	And he answered,
c39197	Thou shalt not smite
c39199	those whom thou hast taken captive with thy sword and with thy bow?
c39200	<i>them:</i> wouldest thou smite
c39201	set bread and water before
c39202	them, that they may eat
c39203	and drink,
c39204	and go to their master.
c39205	And he prepared great provision
c39206	for them: and when they had eaten
c39207	and drunk,
c39208	he sent them away,
c39209	and they went to their master.
c39210	So the bands of Syria came no more
c39211	into the land of Israel.
c39212	And it came to pass after this,
c39213	that Benhadad king of Syria gathered all his host,
c39214	and went up,
c39215	and besieged Samaria.
c39216	And there was a great famine in Samaria:
c39217	and, behold, they besieged
c39218	it, until an ass's head was <i>sold</i> for fourscore <i>pieces</i> of silver,
c39219	and the fourth part of a cab of dove's dung for five <i>pieces</i> of silver.
c39221	And as the king of Israel was passing by upon the wall,
c39222	there cried a woman unto
c39223	him, saying,
c39224	Help,
c39225	my lord, O king.
c39226	And he said,
c39227	If the LORD do not help
c39228	thee, whence shall I help
c39229	thee? out of the barnfloor, or out of the winepress?
c39230	And the king said
c39231	unto her, What
c39232	aileth thee? And she answered,
c39233	This woman said unto
c39234	me, Give thy son,
c39235	that we may eat him to day,
c39236	and we will eat my son to morrow.
c39237	So we boiled my son,
c39238	and did eat
c39239	him: and I said unto her on the next day,
c39240	Give thy son,
c39241	that we may eat
c39242	him: and she hath hid her son.
c39243	And it came to pass,
c39244	when the king heard the words of the woman,
c39245	that he rent his clothes;
c39246	and he passed by upon the wall,
c39247	and the people looked,
c39248	and, behold, <i>he had</i> sackcloth within upon his flesh.
c39249	Then he said,
c39250	God do so
c39251	and more also
c39252	to me, if the head of Elisha the son of Shaphat shall stand on him this day.
c39253	But Elisha sat in his house,
c39254	and the elders sat with
c39255	him; and <i>the king</i> sent a man from before
c39256	him: but ere the messenger came to
c39257	him, he said to the elders,
c39258	See
c39259	ye how this son of a murderer hath sent
c39260	to take away mine head?
c39261	look,
c39262	when the messenger cometh,
c39263	shut the door,
c39264	and hold him fast at the door:
c39265	<i>is</i> not the sound of his master's feet behind him?
c39266	And while he yet talked with
c39267	them, behold, the messenger came down unto
c39268	him: and he said,
c39269	Behold, this
c39270	evil <i>is</i> of the LORD;
c39271	what should I wait for the LORD any longer?
c39272	Then Elisha said,
c39273	Hear ye the word of the LORD;
c39274	Thus saith the LORD,
c39275	To morrow about this time <i>shall</i> a measure of fine flour <i>be sold</i> for a shekel,
c39276	and two measures of barley for a shekel, in the gate of Samaria.
c39277	Then a lord on
c39278	whose hand the king
c39279	leaned answered
c39280	the man of God,
c39281	and said,
c39282	Behold, <i>if</i> the LORD would make windows in heaven,
c39283	might this thing be?
c39284	And he said,
c39285	Behold, thou shalt see <i>it</i> with thine eyes,
c39286	but shalt not eat thereof.
c39287	And there were four leprous men
c39289	at the entering in of the gate:
c39290	and they said
c39291	one to another,
c39292	Why sit we here
c39293	until we die?
c39294	If we say,
c39295	We will enter into the city,
c39296	then the famine <i>is</i> in the city,
c39297	and we shall die there:
c39298	and if we sit still here,
c39299	we die
c39300	also. Now therefore come,
c39301	and let us fall unto the host of the Syrians:
c39302	if they save us alive,
c39303	we shall live;
c39304	and if they kill
c39305	us, we shall but die.
c39306	And they rose up in the twilight,
c39307	to go unto the camp of the Syrians:
c39308	and when they were come to the uttermost part of the camp of Syria,
c39309	behold, <i>there was</i> no man there.
c39310	For the Lord had made the host of the Syrians to hear a noise of chariots, and a noise of horses, <i>even</i> the noise of a great host:
c39311	and they said
c39312	one to another,
c39313	Lo, the king of Israel hath hired against us the kings of the Hittites, and the kings of the Egyptians,
c39314	to come upon us.
c39315	Wherefore they arose
c39316	and fled in the twilight,
c39317	and left their tents, and their horses, and their asses, even the camp
c39318	as it
c39319	<i>was,</i> and fled for their life.
c39320	And when these lepers came to the uttermost part of the camp,
c39321	they went into one tent,
c39322	and did eat
c39323	and drink,
c39324	and carried thence silver, and gold, and raiment,
c39325	and went
c39326	and hid
c39327	<i>it;</i> and came again,
c39328	and entered into another tent,
c39329	and carried thence
c39330	<i>also,</i> and went
c39331	and hid <i>it.</i>
c39332	Then they said
c39333	one to another,
c39334	We do not well:
c39335	this day
c39336	<i>is</i> a day of good tidings,
c39337	and we hold our peace:
c39338	if we tarry till the morning light,
c39339	some mischief will come upon
c39340	us: now therefore come,
c39341	that we may go
c39342	and tell the king's household.
c39343	So they came
c39344	and called unto the porter of the city:
c39345	and they told them, saying,
c39347	We came to the camp of the Syrians,
c39348	and, behold, <i>there was</i> no man there, neither voice of man,
c39349	but horses tied, and asses tied,
c39350	and the tents
c39351	as they <i>were.</i>
c39352	And he called the porters;
c39353	and they told <i>it</i> to the king's house within.
c39354	And the king arose in the night,
c39355	and said unto his servants,
c39356	I will now shew
c39357	you what the Syrians have done
c39358	to us. They know
c39359	that we <i>be</i> hungry;
c39360	therefore are they gone out of the camp
c39361	to hide themselves in the field,
c39362	saying,
c39363	When they come out of the city,
c39364	we shall catch them alive,
c39365	and get into the city.
c39366	And one of his servants answered
c39367	and said,
c39368	Let <i>some</i> take, I pray thee, five of the horses that remain,
c39369	which are left
c39370	in the city, (behold, they <i>are</i> as all the multitude of Israel
c39371	that are left
c39372	in it: behold, <i>I say,</i> they <i>are</i> even as all the multitude of the Israelites
c39373	that are consumed:)
c39374	and let us send
c39375	and see.
c39376	They took therefore two chariot horses;
c39377	and the king sent after the host of the Syrians,
c39378	saying,
c39379	Go
c39380	and see.
c39381	And they went after them unto Jordan:
c39382	and, lo, all the way <i>was</i> full of garments and vessels,
c39383	which the Syrians had cast away
c39384	in their haste.
c39385	And the messengers returned,
c39386	and told the king.
c39387	And the people went out,
c39388	and spoiled the tents of the Syrians.
c39389	So a measure of fine flour was <i>sold</i> for a shekel,
c39390	and two measures of barley for a shekel, according to the word of the LORD.
c39391	And the king appointed the lord
c39392	on whose hand he leaned
c39393	to have the charge of the gate:
c39394	and the people trode upon him in the gate,
c39395	and he died,
c39396	as the man of God had said,
c39397	who spake
c39398	when the king came down to him.
c39399	And it came to pass
c39400	as the man of God had spoken to the king,
c39401	saying,
c39402	Two measures of barley for a shekel,
c39403	and a measure of fine flour for a shekel, shall be to morrow about this time in the gate of Samaria:
c39404	And that lord answered the man of God,
c39405	and said,
c39406	Now, behold, <i>if</i> the LORD should make windows in heaven,
c39407	might such a thing be?
c39408	And he said,
c39409	Behold, thou shalt see it with thine eyes,
c39410	but shalt not eat thereof.
c39411	And so it fell out
c39412	unto him: for the people trode upon him in the gate,
c39413	and he died.
c39414	Then spake Elisha unto the woman,
c39415	whose son he had restored to life,
c39416	saying,
c39417	Arise,
c39418	and go thou and thine household,
c39419	and sojourn
c39420	wheresoever thou canst sojourn:
c39421	for the LORD hath called for a famine;
c39422	and it shall also come upon the land seven years.
c39423	And the woman arose,
c39424	and did after the saying of the man of God:
c39425	and she went with her household,
c39426	and sojourned in the land of the Philistines seven years.
c39427	And it came to pass at the seven years' end,
c39428	that the woman returned out of the land of the Philistines:
c39429	and she went forth
c39430	to cry unto the king for her house and for her land.
c39431	And the king talked with Gehazi the servant of the man of God,
c39432	saying,
c39433	Tell me, I pray thee, all the great things
c39434	that Elisha hath done.
c39435	And it came to pass,
c39436	as he was telling the king
c39437	how he had restored a dead body to life,
c39438	that, behold, the woman,
c39439	whose son he had restored to life,
c39440	cried to the king for her house and for her land.
c39441	And Gehazi said,
c39442	My lord, O king,
c39443	this <i>is</i> the woman,
c39444	and this <i>is</i> her son,
c39445	whom Elisha restored to life.
c39446	And when the king asked the woman,
c39447	she told
c39448	him. So the king appointed unto her a certain officer,
c39449	saying,
c39450	Restore all
c39451	that
c39452	<i>was</i> hers, and all the fruits of the field since the day
c39453	that she left the land,
c39454	even until now.
c39455	And Elisha came to Damascus;
c39456	and Benhadad the king of Syria was sick;
c39457	and it was told
c39458	him, saying,
c39459	The man of God is come hither.
c39460	And the king said unto Hazael,
c39461	Take a present in thine hand,
c39462	and go,
c39463	meet the man of God,
c39464	and enquire of the LORD by
c39465	him, saying,
c39466	Shall I recover of this disease?
c39467	So Hazael went
c39468	to meet
c39469	him, and took a present with
c39470	him, even of every good thing of Damascus, forty camels' burden,
c39471	and came
c39472	and stood before
c39473	him, and said,
c39474	Thy son Benhadad king of Syria hath sent me to
c39475	thee, saying,
c39476	Shall I recover of this disease?
c39477	And Elisha said unto
c39478	him, Go,
c39479	say
c39480	unto him, Thou mayest certainly recover:
c39481	howbeit the LORD hath shewed
c39482	me that he shall surely die.
c39483	And he settled his countenance
c39484	stedfastly,
c39485	until he was ashamed:
c39486	and the man of God wept.
c39487	And Hazael said,
c39488	Why weepeth my lord?
c39489	And he answered,
c39490	Because I know
c39491	the evil that thou wilt do unto the children of Israel:
c39492	their strong holds wilt thou set on fire,
c39493	and their young men wilt thou slay with the sword,
c39494	and wilt dash their children,
c39495	and rip up their women with child.
c39496	And Hazael said,
c39497	But what, <i>is</i> thy servant a dog,
c39498	that he should do this great thing?
c39499	And Elisha answered,
c39500	The LORD hath shewed
c39501	me that thou <i>shalt be</i> king over Syria.
c39502	So he departed from Elisha,
c39503	and came to his master;
c39504	who said
c39505	to him, What said Elisha
c39506	to thee? And he answered,
c39507	He told
c39508	me <i>that</i> thou shouldest surely recover.
c39509	And it came to pass on the morrow,
c39510	that he took a thick cloth,
c39511	and dipped <i>it</i> in water,
c39512	and spread <i>it</i> on his face,
c39513	so that he died:
c39514	and Hazael reigned in his stead.
c39515	And in the fifth year of Joram the son of Ahab king of Israel,
c39516	Jehoshaphat <i>being</i> then king of Judah,
c39517	Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat king of Judah began to reign.
c39518	Thirty and two years old was
c39519	he when he began to reign;
c39520	and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem.
c39521	And he walked in the way of the kings of Israel,
c39522	as did the house of Ahab:
c39523	for the daughter of Ahab was his wife:
c39524	and he did evil in the sight of the LORD.
c39525	Yet the LORD would not
c39526	destroy Judah for David his servant's sake,
c39527	as he promised
c39528	him to give him alway a light,
c39529	<i>and</i> to his children.
c39530	In his days Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah,
c39531	and made a king over themselves.
c39532	So Joram went over to Zair,
c39533	and all the chariots with
c39535	him: and he rose by night,
c39536	and smote the Edomites
c39537	which compassed him about,
c39538	and the captains of the chariots:
c39539	and the people fled into their tents.
c39540	Yet Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah unto this day.
c39541	Then Libnah revolted at the same time.
c39542	And the rest of the acts of Joram, and all
c39543	that he did,
c39544	<i>are</i> they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
c39545	And Joram slept with his fathers,
c39546	and was buried with his fathers in the city of David:
c39547	and Ahaziah his son reigned in his stead.
c39548	In the twelfth year of Joram the son of Ahab king of Israel did Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah begin to reign.
c39549	Two and twenty years old <i>was</i> Ahaziah
c39550	when he began to reign;
c39551	and he reigned one year in Jerusalem.
c39552	And his mother's name <i>was</i> Athaliah, the daughter of Omri king of Israel.
c39553	And he walked in the way of the house of Ahab,
c39554	and did evil in the sight of the LORD, as <i>did</i> the house of Ahab:
c39555	for he <i>was</i> the son in law of the house of Ahab.
c39556	And he went with Joram the son of Ahab to the war against Hazael king of Syria in Ramothgilead;
c39557	and the Syrians wounded Joram.
c39558	And king Joram went back
c39559	to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds
c39560	which the Syrians had given him at Ramah,
c39561	when he fought against Hazael king of Syria.
c39562	And Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah went down
c39563	to see Joram the son of Ahab in Jezreel,
c39564	because he was sick.
c39565	And Elisha the prophet called one of the children of the prophets,
c39566	and said
c39567	unto him, Gird up thy loins,
c39568	and take this box of oil in thine hand,
c39569	and go to Ramothgilead:
c39570	And when thou comest thither,
c39571	look out there Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi,
c39572	and go in,
c39573	and make him arise up from among his brethren,
c39574	and carry him to an inner chamber;
c39575	Then take the box of oil,
c39576	and pour <i>it</i> on his head,
c39577	and say,
c39578	Thus saith the LORD,
c39579	I have anointed thee king over Israel.
c39580	Then open the door,
c39581	and flee,
c39582	and tarry not.
c39583	So the young man, <i>even</i> the young man the prophet, went to Ramothgilead.
c39584	And when he came,
c39585	behold,
c39586	the captains of the host <i>were</i> sitting;
c39587	and he said,
c39588	I have an errand to
c39589	thee, O captain.
c39590	And Jehu said,
c39591	Unto which of all
c39592	us? And he said,
c39593	To
c39594	thee, O captain.
c39595	And he arose,
c39596	and went into the house;
c39597	and he poured the oil on his head,
c39598	and said
c39599	unto him, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel,
c39600	I have anointed thee king over the people of the LORD, <i>even</i> over Israel.
c39601	And thou shalt smite the house of Ahab thy master,
c39602	that I may avenge the blood of my servants the prophets, and the blood of all the servants of the LORD, at the hand of Jezebel.
c39603	For the whole house of Ahab shall perish:
c39604	and I will cut off from Ahab
c39605	him that pisseth against the wall,
c39606	and him that is shut up and left in Israel:
c39607	And I will make the house of Ahab like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah:
c39608	And the dogs shall eat Jezebel in the portion of Jezreel,
c39609	and <i>there shall be</i> none to bury
c39610	<i>her.</i> And he opened the door,
c39611	and fled.
c39612	Then Jehu came forth to the servants of his lord:
c39613	and <i>one</i> said
c39614	unto him, <i>Is</i> all well?
c39615	wherefore came this mad <i>fellow</i> to
c39616	thee? And he said unto
c39617	them, Ye know the man, and his communication.
c39618	And they said,
c39619	<i>It is</i> false;
c39620	tell us now.
c39621	And he said,
c39622	Thus and thus spake he to
c39623	me, saying,
c39624	Thus saith the LORD,
c39625	I have anointed thee king over Israel.
c39626	Then they hasted,
c39627	and took every man his garment,
c39628	and put <i>it</i> under him on the top of the stairs,
c39629	and blew with trumpets,
c39630	saying,
c39631	Jehu is king.
c39632	So Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi conspired against Joram.
c39633	(Now Joram had kept Ramothgilead,
c39634	he and all Israel, because of Hazael king of Syria.
c39635	But king Joram was returned
c39636	to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds
c39637	which the Syrians had given
c39638	him, when he fought with Hazael king of Syria.)
c39639	And Jehu said,
c39640	If it be your minds,
c39641	<i>then</i> let none go forth <i>nor</i> escape out of the city
c39642	to go
c39643	to tell <i>it</i> in Jezreel.
c39644	So Jehu rode in a chariot,
c39645	and went to Jezreel;
c39646	for Joram lay there.
c39647	And Ahaziah king of Judah was come down
c39648	to see Joram.
c39649	And there stood a watchman on the tower in Jezreel,
c39650	and he spied the company of Jehu
c39651	as he came,
c39652	and said,
c39653	I see a company.
c39654	And Joram said,
c39655	Take an horseman,
c39656	and send
c39657	to meet
c39658	them, and let him say,
c39659	<i>Is it</i> peace?
c39660	So there went one on horseback
c39661	to meet
c39662	him, and said,
c39663	Thus saith the king,
c39664	<i>Is it</i> peace?
c39665	And Jehu said,
c39666	What hast thou to do with peace?
c39667	turn thee behind
c39668	me. And the watchman told,
c39669	saying,
c39670	The messenger came to them,
c39671	but he cometh not again.
c39672	Then he sent out a second on horseback,
c39673	which came to
c39674	them, and said,
c39675	Thus saith the king,
c39676	<i>Is it</i> peace?
c39677	And Jehu answered,
c39678	What hast thou to do with peace?
c39679	turn thee behind me.
c39680	And the watchman told,
c39681	saying,
c39682	He came even unto
c39683	them, and cometh not again:
c39684	and the driving <i>is</i> like the driving of Jehu the son of Nimshi;
c39685	for he driveth furiously.
c39686	And Joram said,
c39687	Make ready.
c39688	And his chariot was made ready.
c39689	And Joram king of Israel and Ahaziah king of Judah went out,
c39690	each in his chariot,
c39691	and they went out
c39692	against Jehu,
c39693	and met him in the portion of Naboth the Jezreelite.
c39694	And it came to pass,
c39695	when Joram saw Jehu,
c39696	that he said,
c39697	<i>Is it</i> peace,
c39698	Jehu?
c39699	And he answered,
c39700	What peace, so long as the whoredoms of thy mother Jezebel and her witchcrafts <i>are so</i> many?
c39701	And Joram turned his hands,
c39702	and fled,
c39703	and said to Ahaziah,
c39704	<i>There is</i> treachery,
c39705	O Ahaziah.
c39706	And Jehu drew a bow with his full strength,
c39707	and smote Jehoram between his arms,
c39708	and the arrow went out at his heart,
c39709	and he sunk down in his chariot.
c39710	Then said <i>Jehu</i> to Bidkar his captain,
c39711	Take up,
c39712	<i>and</i> cast him in the portion of the field of Naboth the Jezreelite:
c39713	for remember
c39714	how that, when I and thou rode together after Ahab his father,
c39715	the LORD laid this burden upon him;
c39716	Surely I have seen yesterday the blood of Naboth, and the blood of his sons,
c39717	saith the LORD;
c39718	and I will requite thee in this plat,
c39719	saith the LORD.
c39720	Now
c39721	therefore take
c39722	<i>and</i> cast him into the plat <i>of ground,</i> according to the word of the LORD.
c39723	But when Ahaziah the king of Judah saw
c39724	<i>this,</i> he fled by the way of the garden house.
c39725	And Jehu followed after
c39726	him, and said,
c39727	him also in the chariot. <i>And they did so</i> at the going up to Gur,
c39728	Smite
c39730	which <i>is</i> by Ibleam.
c39731	And he fled to Megiddo,
c39732	and died there.
c39733	And his servants carried him in a chariot to Jerusalem,
c39734	and buried him in his sepulchre with his fathers in the city of David.
c39735	And in the eleventh year of Joram the son of Ahab began Ahaziah to reign over Judah.
c39736	And when Jehu was come to Jezreel,
c39737	Jezebel heard
c39738	<i>of it;</i> and she painted her face,
c39739	and tired her head,
c39740	and looked out at a window.
c39741	And as Jehu entered in at the gate,
c39742	she said,
c39744	<i>Had</i> Zimri peace, who slew his master?
c39745	And he lifted up his face to the window,
c39746	and said,
c39747	Who <i>is</i> on my side?
c39748	who?
c39749	And there looked out to him two <i>or</i> three eunuchs.
c39750	And he said,
c39751	Throw her down.
c39752	So they threw her down:
c39753	and <i>some</i> of her blood was sprinkled on the wall, and on the horses:
c39754	and he trode her under foot.
c39755	And when he was come in,
c39756	he did eat
c39757	and drink,
c39758	and said,
c39759	Go, see now this cursed
c39760	<i>woman,</i> and bury
c39761	her: for she <i>is</i> a king's daughter.
c39762	And they went
c39763	to bury
c39764	her: but they found no more
c39765	of her than the skull, and the feet, and the palms of <i>her</i> hands.
c39766	Wherefore they came again,
c39767	and told
c39768	him. And he said,
c39769	This <i>is</i> the word of the LORD,
c39770	which he spake by his servant Elijah the Tishbite,
c39771	saying,
c39772	In the portion of Jezreel shall dogs eat the flesh of Jezebel:
c39773	And the carcase of Jezebel shall be as dung upon the face of the field in the portion of Jezreel;
c39774	<i>so</i> that they shall not say,
c39775	This <i>is</i> Jezebel.
c39776	And Ahab had seventy sons in Samaria.
c39777	And Jehu wrote letters,
c39778	and sent to Samaria, unto the rulers of Jezreel, to the elders,
c39779	and to them that brought up Ahab's
c39780	<i>children,</i> saying,
c39781	Now
c39782	as soon as this letter cometh to
c39783	you, seeing your master's sons <i>are</i> with
c39784	you, and <i>there are</i> with you chariots and horses, a fenced city also, and armour;
c39785	Look even out the best and meetest of your master's sons,
c39786	and set <i>him</i> on his father's throne,
c39787	and fight for your master's house.
c39788	But they were exceedingly afraid,
c39789	and said,
c39790	Behold, two kings stood not before
c39791	him: how then shall we stand?
c39792	<i>of the children,</i> sent
c39793	And he that <i>was</i> over the house,
c39794	and he that <i>was</i> over the city,
c39795	the elders also, and the bringers up
c39796	to Jehu,
c39797	saying,
c39798	We <i>are</i> thy servants,
c39799	all
c39800	that thou shalt bid
c39801	and will do
c39802	us; we will not make any king:
c39803	do thou <i>that which is</i> good in thine eyes.
c39804	Then he wrote a letter the second time to
c39805	them, saying,
c39806	If ye
c39807	<i>be</i> mine, and <i>if</i> ye will hearken unto my voice,
c39808	take ye the heads of the men your master's sons,
c39809	and come to me to Jezreel by to morrow this time.
c39810	Now the king's sons, <i>being</i> seventy persons, <i>were</i> with the great men of the city,
c39811	which brought them up.
c39812	And it came to pass,
c39813	when the letter came to
c39814	them, that they took the king's sons,
c39815	and slew seventy persons,
c39816	and put their heads in baskets,
c39817	and sent him <i>them</i> to Jezreel.
c39818	And there came a messenger,
c39819	and told
c39820	him, saying,
c39821	They have brought the heads of the king's sons.
c39822	And he said,
c39823	Lay ye them in two heaps at the entering in of the gate until the morning.
c39824	And it came to pass in the morning,
c39825	that he went out,
c39826	and stood,
c39827	and said to all the people,
c39828	Ye <i>be</i> righteous:
c39829	behold, I conspired against my master,
c39830	and slew
c39831	him: but who slew all these?
c39832	Know now
c39833	that there shall fall unto the earth nothing of the word of the LORD,
c39834	which the LORD spake concerning the house of Ahab:
c39835	for the LORD hath done
c39836	<i>that</i> which he spake by his servant Elijah.
c39837	So Jehu slew all
c39838	that remained of the house of Ahab in Jezreel,
c39839	and all his great men, and his kinsfolks, and his priests,
c39840	until he left him none remaining.
c39841	And he arose
c39842	and departed,
c39843	and came to Samaria.
c39844	<i>And</i> as he <i>was</i> at the shearing house in the way,
c39845	Jehu met with the brethren of Ahaziah king of Judah,
c39846	and said,
c39847	Who <i>are</i> ye?
c39848	And they answered,
c39849	We <i>are</i> the brethren of Ahaziah;
c39850	and we go down to salute the children of the king and the children of the queen.
c39851	And he said,
c39852	Take them alive.
c39853	And they took them alive,
c39854	and slew them at the pit of the shearing house, <i>even</i> two and forty men;
c39855	neither left he any of them.
c39856	And when he was departed thence,
c39857	he lighted on Jehonadab the son of Rechab
c39858	<i>coming</i> to meet
c39859	him: and he saluted
c39860	him, and said to
c39861	him, Is thine heart right,
c39862	as my heart <i>is</i> with thy heart?
c39863	And Jehonadab answered,
c39864	It is.
c39865	If it be,
c39866	give <i>me</i> thine hand.
c39867	And he gave <i>him</i> his hand;
c39868	and he took him up to him into the chariot.
c39869	And he said,
c39870	Come with
c39871	me, and see my zeal for the LORD.
c39872	So they made him ride in his chariot.
c39873	And when he came to Samaria,
c39874	he slew all
c39875	that remained unto Ahab in Samaria,
c39876	till he had destroyed
c39877	him, according to the saying of the LORD,
c39878	which he spake to Elijah.
c39879	And Jehu gathered all the people
c39880	together, and said unto
c39881	them, Ahab served Baal a little;
c39882	<i>but</i> Jehu shall serve him much.
c39883	Now
c39884	therefore call unto me all the prophets of Baal, all his servants, and all his priests;
c39885	let none be wanting:
c39886	for I have a great sacrifice <i>to do</i> to Baal;
c39887	whosoever
c39888	shall be wanting,
c39889	he shall not live.
c39890	But Jehu did <i>it</i> in subtilty,
c39891	to the intent that he might destroy the worshippers of Baal.
c39892	And Jehu said,
c39893	Proclaim a solemn assembly for Baal.
c39894	And they proclaimed <i>it.</i>
c39895	And Jehu sent through all Israel:
c39896	and all the worshippers of Baal came,
c39897	so that there was not a man left
c39898	that came not.
c39899	And they came into the house of Baal;
c39900	and the house of Baal was full from one end to another.
c39901	And he said
c39902	unto him that <i>was</i> over the vestry,
c39903	Bring forth vestments for all the worshippers of Baal.
c39904	And he brought them forth vestments.
c39905	And Jehu went, and Jehonadab the son of Rechab, into the house of Baal,
c39906	and said unto the worshippers of Baal,
c39907	Search,
c39908	and look
c39909	that there be here with you none of the servants of the LORD,
c39910	but the worshippers of Baal only.
c39911	And when they went in
c39912	to offer sacrifices and burnt offerings,
c39913	Jehu appointed fourscore men without,
c39914	and said,
c39915	<i>If</i> any
c39916	of the men whom I have brought into your hands escape,
c39918	<i>he that letteth him go,</i> his life <i>shall be</i> for the life of him.
c39919	And it came to pass,
c39920	as soon as he had made an end
c39921	of offering the burnt offering,
c39922	that Jehu said to the guard and to the captains,
c39923	Go in,
c39924	<i>and</i> slay
c39925	them; let none come forth.
c39926	And they smote them with the edge of the sword;
c39927	and the guard and the captains cast <i>them</i> out,
c39928	and went to the city of the house of Baal.
c39929	And they brought forth the images out of the house of Baal,
c39930	and burned them.
c39931	And they brake down the image of Baal,
c39932	and brake down the house of Baal,
c39933	and made it a draught house unto this day.
c39934	Thus Jehu destroyed Baal out of Israel.
c39935	Howbeit <i>from</i> the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat,
c39936	who made Israel to sin,
c39937	Jehu departed not from after
c39938	them, <i>to wit,</i> the golden calves
c39939	that <i>were</i> in Bethel,
c39940	and that <i>were</i> in Dan.
c39941	And the LORD said unto Jehu,
c39942	Because thou hast done well
c39943	in executing <i>that which is</i> right in mine eyes,
c39944	according to all
c39945	that <i>was</i> in mine heart,
c39946	<i>and</i> hast done unto the house of Ahab
c39947	thy children of the fourth <i>generation</i> shall sit on the throne of Israel.
c39948	But Jehu took no heed
c39949	to walk in the law of the LORD God of Israel with all his heart:
c39950	for he departed not from the sins of Jeroboam,
c39951	which made Israel to sin.
c39952	In those days the LORD began
c39953	to cut Israel short:
c39954	and Hazael smote them in all the coasts of Israel;
c39955	From Jordan eastward,
c39956	all the land of Gilead, the Gadites, and the Reubenites, and the Manassites,
c39957	from Aroer,
c39958	which <i>is</i> by the river Arnon,
c39959	even Gilead and Bashan.
c39960	Now the rest of the acts of Jehu, and all
c39961	that he did,
c39962	and all his might,
c39963	<i>are</i> they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
c39964	And Jehu slept with his fathers:
c39965	and they buried him in Samaria.
c39966	And Jehoahaz his son reigned in his stead.
c39967	And the time
c39968	that Jehu reigned over Israel
c39969	in Samaria <i>was</i> twenty and eight years.
c39970	And when Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw
c39971	that her son was dead,
c39972	she arose
c39973	and destroyed all the seed royal.
c39974	But Jehosheba, the daughter of king Joram, sister of Ahaziah, took Joash the son of Ahaziah,
c39975	and stole him from among the king's sons
c39976	<i>which were</i> slain;
c39978	and they hid him, <i>even</i> him and his nurse, in the bedchamber from Athaliah,
c39979	so that he was not slain.
c39980	And he was with her hid in the house of the LORD six years.
c39981	And Athaliah did reign over the land.
c39982	And the seventh year Jehoiada sent
c39983	and fetched the rulers over hundreds, with the captains and the guard,
c39984	and brought them to him into the house of the LORD,
c39985	and made a covenant
c39986	with them, and took an oath of them in the house of the LORD,
c39987	and shewed them the king's son.
c39988	And he commanded
c39989	them, saying,
c39990	This <i>is</i> the thing
c39991	that ye shall do;
c39992	A third part of
c39993	you that enter in on the sabbath
c39994	shall even be keepers of the watch of the king's house;
c39995	And a third part <i>shall be</i> at the gate of Sur;
c39996	and a third part at the gate behind the guard:
c39997	so shall ye keep the watch of the house, that it be not broken down.
c39998	And two parts of all you that go forth on the sabbath,
c39999	even they shall keep the watch of the house of the LORD about the king.
c40000	And ye shall compass the king round about,
c40001	every man
c40002	with his weapons in his hand:
c40004	and he that cometh within the ranges,
c40005	let him be slain:
c40006	and be ye with the king
c40007	as he goeth out
c40008	and as he cometh in.
c40009	And the captains over the hundreds did according to all
c40010	<i>things</i> that Jehoiada the priest commanded:
c40011	and they took
c40012	every man his men
c40013	that were to come in on the sabbath,
c40014	with them that should go out on the sabbath,
c40015	and came to Jehoiada the priest.
c40016	And to the captains over hundreds did the priest give king David's spears and shields,
c40017	that
c40018	<i>were</i> in the temple of the LORD.
c40019	And the guard stood, every man
c40020	with his weapons in his hand,
c40021	round about the king, from the right corner of the temple to the left corner of the temple, <i>along</i> by the altar and the temple.
c40022	And he brought forth the king's son,
c40023	and put the crown upon him, and <i>gave him</i> the testimony;
c40024	and they made him king,
c40025	and anointed
c40026	him; and they clapped their hands,
c40027	and said,
c40028	God save the king.
c40029	And when Athaliah heard the noise of the guard <i>and</i> of the people,
c40030	she came to the people into the temple of the LORD.
c40031	And when she looked,
c40032	behold, the king stood by a pillar, as the manner
c40033	<i>was,</i> and the princes and the trumpeters by the king,
c40034	and all the people of the land rejoiced,
c40035	and blew with trumpets:
c40036	and Athaliah rent her clothes,
c40037	and cried,
c40038	Treason, Treason.
c40039	But Jehoiada the priest commanded the captains of the hundreds,
c40040	the officers of the host,
c40041	and said unto
c40042	them, Have her forth without the ranges:
c40044	and him that followeth
c40045	her kill with the sword.
c40046	For the priest had said,
c40047	Let her not be slain in the house of the LORD.
c40048	And they laid hands
c40049	on her; and she went by the way by the which the horses came into the king's house:
c40050	and there was she slain.
c40051	And Jehoiada made a covenant between the LORD and the king and the people, that they should be the LORD'S people; between
c40053	the king also and the people.
c40054	And all the people of the land went into the house of Baal,
c40055	and brake it down;
c40056	his altars and his images brake they in pieces thoroughly,
c40057	and slew Mattan the priest of Baal before the altars.
c40058	And the priest appointed officers over the house of the LORD.
c40059	And he took the rulers over hundreds, and the captains, and the guard, and all the people of the land;
c40060	and they brought down the king from the house of the LORD,
c40061	and came by the way of the gate of the guard to the king's house.
c40062	And he sat on the throne of the kings.
c40063	And all the people of the land rejoiced,
c40064	and the city was in quiet:
c40065	and they slew Athaliah with the sword <i>beside</i> the king's house.
c40066	Seven years old <i>was</i> Jehoash
c40067	when he began to reign.
c40068	In the seventh year of Jehu Jehoash began to reign;
c40069	and forty years reigned he in Jerusalem.
c40070	And his mother's name <i>was</i> Zibiah of Beersheba.
c40071	And Jehoash did
c40072	<i>that which was</i> right in the sight of the LORD
c40073	all his days
c40074	wherein Jehoiada the priest instructed him.
c40075	But the high places were not taken away:
c40076	the people still sacrificed
c40077	and burnt incense in the high places.
c40078	And Jehoash said to the priests,
c40079	All the money of the dedicated things
c40080	that is brought into the house of the LORD, <i>even</i> the money of every one that passeth
c40081	<i>the account,</i> the money that every man is set at, <i>and</i> all the money
c40083	that cometh into any man's heart
c40084	to bring into the house of the LORD,
c40085	Let the priests take
c40086	<i>it</i> to them, every man of his acquaintance:
c40087	and let them repair the breaches of the house, wheresoever
c40088	any breach shall be found.
c40089	But it was <i>so, that</i> in the three and twentieth year of king Jehoash
c40090	the priests had not repaired the breaches of the house.
c40091	Then king Jehoash called for Jehoiada the priest, and the <i>other</i> priests,
c40092	and said unto
c40093	them, Why repair ye not the breaches of the house?
c40094	now therefore receive no <i>more</i> money of your acquaintance,
c40095	but deliver it for the breaches of the house.
c40096	And the priests consented
c40097	to receive no <i>more</i> money of the people,
c40098	neither to repair the breaches of the house.
c40099	But Jehoiada the priest took a chest,
c40100	and bored a hole in the lid
c40101	of it, and set it beside the altar, on the right side
c40102	as one cometh into the house of the LORD:
c40103	and the priests that kept the door put therein all the money
c40104	<i>that was</i> brought into the house of the LORD.
c40105	And it was
c40106	<i>so,</i> when they saw
c40107	that <i>there was</i> much money in the chest,
c40108	that the king's scribe and the high priest came up,
c40109	and they put up in bags,
c40110	and told the money
c40111	that was found in the house of the LORD.
c40112	And they gave the money, being told, into the hands of them that did the work,
c40113	that had the oversight of the house of the LORD:
c40114	and they laid it out to the carpenters and builders,
c40115	that wrought upon the house of the LORD,
c40116	And to masons, and hewers of stone,
c40117	and to buy timber and hewed stone
c40118	to repair the breaches of the house of the LORD,
c40119	and for all
c40120	that was laid out for the house to repair <i>it.</i>
c40121	Howbeit there were not made for the house of the LORD bowls of silver, snuffers, basons, trumpets, any vessels of gold, or vessels of silver, of the money
c40122	<i>that was</i> brought into the house of the LORD:
c40123	But they gave that to the workmen,
c40124	and repaired therewith the house of the LORD.
c40125	Moreover they reckoned not with the men,
c40126	into whose hand they delivered the money
c40127	to be bestowed on workmen:
c40128	for they dealt faithfully.
c40129	The trespass money and sin money was not brought into the house of the LORD:
c40130	it was the priests'.
c40131	Then Hazael king of Syria went up,
c40132	and fought against Gath,
c40133	and took
c40134	it: and Hazael set his face
c40135	to go up to Jerusalem.
c40136	And Jehoash king of Judah took all the hallowed things
c40137	that Jehoshaphat, and Jehoram, and Ahaziah, his fathers, kings of Judah, had dedicated,
c40138	and his own hallowed things, and all the gold
c40139	<i>that was</i> found in the treasures of the house of the LORD, and in the king's house,
c40140	and sent <i>it</i> to Hazael king of Syria:
c40141	and he went away from Jerusalem.
c40142	And the rest of the acts of Joash, and all
c40143	that he did,
c40144	<i>are</i> they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
c40145	And his servants arose,
c40146	and made a conspiracy,
c40147	and slew Joash in the house of Millo,
c40148	which goeth down to Silla.
c40149	For Jozachar the son of Shimeath, and Jehozabad the son of Shomer, his servants, smote
c40150	him, and he died;
c40151	and they buried him with his fathers in the city of David:
c40152	and Amaziah his son reigned in his stead.
c40153	In the three and twentieth year of Joash the son of Ahaziah king of Judah Jehoahaz the son of Jehu began to reign over Israel in Samaria, <i>and reigned</i> seventeen years.
c40154	And he did
c40155	<i>that which was</i> evil in the sight of the LORD,
c40156	and followed the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat,
c40157	which made Israel to sin;
c40158	he departed not therefrom.
c40159	And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel,
c40160	and he delivered them into the hand of Hazael king of Syria, and into the hand of Benhadad the son of Hazael, all <i>their</i> days.
c40161	And Jehoahaz besought the LORD,
c40162	and the LORD hearkened unto
c40163	him: for he saw the oppression of Israel,
c40164	because the king of Syria oppressed them.
c40165	(And the LORD gave Israel a saviour,
c40166	so that they went out from under the hand of the Syrians:
c40167	and the children of Israel dwelt in their tents, as beforetime.
c40168	Nevertheless they departed not from the sins of the house of Jeroboam,
c40169	who made Israel sin,
c40170	<i>but</i> walked
c40171	therein: and there remained the grove also in Samaria.)
c40172	Neither did he leave of the people to Jehoahaz
c40173	but fifty horsemen, and ten chariots, and ten thousand footmen;
c40174	for the king of Syria had destroyed
c40175	them, and had made them like the dust
c40176	by threshing.
c40177	Now the rest of the acts of Jehoahaz, and all
c40178	that he did,
c40179	and his might,
c40180	<i>are</i> they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
c40181	And Jehoahaz slept with his fathers;
c40182	and they buried him in Samaria:
c40183	and Joash his son reigned in his stead.
c40184	In the thirty and seventh year of Joash king of Judah began Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz to reign over Israel in Samaria, <i>and reigned</i> sixteen years.
c40185	And he did
c40186	<i>that which was</i> evil in the sight of the LORD;
c40187	he departed not from all the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat,
c40188	who made Israel sin:
c40189	<i>but</i> he walked therein.
c40190	And the rest of the acts of Joash, and all
c40191	that he did,
c40192	and his might
c40193	wherewith he fought against Amaziah king of Judah,
c40194	<i>are</i> they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
c40195	And Joash slept with his fathers;
c40196	and Jeroboam sat upon his throne:
c40197	and Joash was buried in Samaria with the kings of Israel.
c40198	Now Elisha was fallen sick of his sickness
c40199	whereof he died.
c40200	And Joash the king of Israel came down unto
c40201	him, and wept over his face,
c40202	and said,
c40203	O my father, my father,
c40204	the chariot of Israel, and the horsemen thereof.
c40205	And Elisha said
c40206	unto him, Take bow and arrows.
c40207	And he took unto him bow and arrows.
c40208	And he said to the king of Israel,
c40209	Put thine hand upon the bow.
c40210	And he put his hand
c40211	<i>upon it:</i> and Elisha put his hands upon the king's hands.
c40212	And he said,
c40213	Open the window eastward.
c40214	And he opened
c40215	<i>it.</i> Then Elisha said,
c40216	Shoot.
c40217	And he shot.
c40218	And he said,
c40219	The arrow of the LORD'S deliverance,
c40220	and the arrow of deliverance from Syria:
c40221	for thou shalt smite the Syrians in Aphek,
c40222	till thou have consumed <i>them.</i>
c40223	And he said,
c40224	Take the arrows.
c40225	And he took
c40226	<i>them.</i> And he said unto the king of Israel,
c40227	Smite upon the ground.
c40228	And he smote thrice,
c40229	and stayed.
c40230	And the man of God was wroth with
c40231	him, and said,
c40232	Thou shouldest have smitten five or six times;
c40233	then hadst thou smitten Syria
c40234	till thou hadst consumed
c40235	<i>it:</i> whereas now thou shalt smite Syria <i>but</i> thrice.
c40236	And Elisha died,
c40237	and they buried
c40238	him. And the bands of the Moabites invaded the land
c40239	at the coming in of the year.
c40240	And it came to pass,
c40241	as they were burying a man,
c40242	that, behold, they spied a band
c40243	<i>of men;</i> and they cast the man into the sepulchre of Elisha:
c40245	and when the man was let down, and touched the bones of Elisha,
c40246	he revived,
c40247	and stood up on his feet.
c40248	But Hazael king of Syria oppressed Israel all the days of Jehoahaz.
c40249	And the LORD was gracious unto them, and had compassion on
c40251	them, and had respect unto them, because of his covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob,
c40252	and would not
c40253	destroy
c40254	them, neither cast he them from his presence as yet.
c40255	So Hazael king of Syria died;
c40256	and Benhadad his son reigned in his stead.
c40257	And Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz took again
c40258	out of the hand of Benhadad the son of Hazael the cities,
c40259	which he had taken out of the hand of Jehoahaz his father by war.
c40260	Three times did Joash beat
c40261	him, and recovered the cities of Israel.
c40262	In the second year of Joash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel reigned Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah.
c40263	He was twenty and five years old
c40264	when he began to reign,
c40265	and reigned twenty and nine years in Jerusalem.
c40266	And his mother's name <i>was</i> Jehoaddan of Jerusalem.
c40267	And he did
c40268	<i>that which was</i> right in the sight of the LORD,
c40269	yet not like David his father:
c40271	he did according to all things as Joash his father
c40272	did.
c40273	Howbeit the high places were not taken away:
c40274	as yet the people did sacrifice
c40275	and burnt incense on the high places.
c40276	And it came to pass,
c40277	as soon as the kingdom was confirmed in his hand,
c40278	that he slew his servants
c40279	which had slain the king his father.
c40280	But the children of the murderers he slew not:
c40281	according unto that which is written in the book of the law of Moses,
c40282	wherein the LORD commanded,
c40283	saying,
c40284	The fathers shall not be put to death for the children,
c40285	nor the children be put to death for the fathers;
c40286	but every man shall be put to death for his own sin.
c40287	He slew of Edom in the valley of salt ten thousand,
c40288	and took Selah by war,
c40289	and called the name of it Joktheel unto this day.
c40290	Then Amaziah sent messengers to Jehoash, the son of Jehoahaz son of Jehu, king of Israel,
c40291	saying,
c40292	Come,
c40293	let us look one another in the face.
c40294	And Jehoash the king of Israel sent to Amaziah king of Judah,
c40295	saying,
c40296	The thistle
c40297	that <i>was</i> in Lebanon
c40298	sent to the cedar
c40299	that <i>was</i> in Lebanon,
c40300	saying,
c40301	Give thy daughter to my son to wife:
c40302	and there passed by a wild beast
c40303	that <i>was</i> in Lebanon,
c40304	and trode down the thistle.
c40305	Thou hast indeed smitten Edom,
c40306	and thine heart hath lifted thee up:
c40307	glory
c40308	<i>of this,</i> and tarry at home:
c40309	for why shouldest thou meddle to <i>thy</i> hurt,
c40310	that thou shouldest fall, <i>even</i> thou, and Judah with thee?
c40311	But Amaziah would not hear.
c40312	Therefore Jehoash king of Israel went up;
c40313	and he and Amaziah king of Judah looked one another in the face at Bethshemesh,
c40314	which <i>belongeth</i> to Judah.
c40315	And Judah was put to the worse before Israel;
c40316	and they fled
c40317	every man to their tents.
c40318	And Jehoash king of Israel took Amaziah king of Judah, the son of Jehoash the son of Ahaziah, at Bethshemesh,
c40319	and came to Jerusalem,
c40320	and brake down the wall of Jerusalem from the gate of Ephraim unto the corner gate, four hundred cubits.
c40321	And he took all the gold and silver, and all the vessels
c40322	that were found in the house of the LORD, and in the treasures of the king's house,
c40323	and hostages,
c40324	and returned to Samaria.
c40325	Now the rest of the acts of Jehoash
c40326	which he did,
c40327	and his might,
c40328	and how he fought with Amaziah king of Judah,
c40329	<i>are</i> they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
c40330	And Jehoash slept with his fathers,
c40331	and was buried in Samaria with the kings of Israel;
c40332	and Jeroboam his son reigned in his stead.
c40333	And Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah lived after the death of Jehoash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel fifteen years.
c40334	And the rest of the acts of Amaziah,
c40335	<i>are</i> they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
c40336	Now they made a conspiracy against him in Jerusalem:
c40337	and he fled to Lachish;
c40338	but they sent after him to Lachish,
c40339	and slew him there.
c40340	And they brought him on horses:
c40341	and he was buried at Jerusalem with his fathers in the city of David.
c40342	And all the people of Judah took Azariah,
c40343	which <i>was</i> sixteen years old,
c40344	and made him king instead of his father Amaziah.
c40345	He built Elath,
c40346	and restored it to Judah,
c40347	after that the king slept with his fathers.
c40348	In the fifteenth year of Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah Jeroboam the son of Joash king of Israel began to reign in Samaria, <i>and reigned</i> forty and one years.
c40349	And he did
c40350	<i>that which was</i> evil in the sight of the LORD:
c40351	he departed not from all the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat,
c40352	who made Israel to sin.
c40353	He restored the coast of Israel
c40354	from the entering of Hamath
c40355	unto the sea of the plain, according to the word of the LORD God of Israel,
c40356	which he spake by the hand of his servant Jonah, the son of Amittai, the prophet,
c40357	which <i>was</i> of Gathhepher.
c40358	For the LORD saw the affliction of Israel,
c40359	<i>that it was</i> very bitter:
c40360	for <i>there was</i> not any shut up,
c40361	nor any left,
c40362	nor any helper for Israel.
c40363	And the LORD said not
c40364	that he would blot out the name of Israel from under heaven:
c40365	but he saved them by the hand of Jeroboam the son of Joash.
c40366	Now the rest of the acts of Jeroboam, and all
c40367	that he did,
c40368	and his might,
c40369	how he warred,
c40370	and how he recovered Damascus, and Hamath, <i>which belonged</i> to Judah, for Israel,
c40371	are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
c40372	And Jeroboam slept with his fathers, <i>even</i> with the kings of Israel;
c40373	and Zachariah his son reigned in his stead.
c40374	In the twenty and seventh year of Jeroboam king of Israel began Azariah son of Amaziah king of Judah to reign.
c40375	Sixteen years old was
c40376	he when he began to reign,
c40377	and he reigned two and fifty years in Jerusalem.
c40378	And his mother's name <i>was</i> Jecholiah of Jerusalem.
c40379	And he did
c40380	<i>that which was</i> right in the sight of the LORD,
c40381	according to all
c40382	that his father Amaziah had done;
c40383	Save that the high places were not removed:
c40384	the people sacrificed and burnt incense still
c40385	on the high places.
c40386	And the LORD smote the king,
c40387	so that he was a leper unto the day of his death,
c40388	and dwelt in a several house.
c40389	And Jotham the king's son <i>was</i> over the house,
c40390	judging the people of the land.
c40391	And the rest of the acts of Azariah, and all
c40392	that he did,
c40393	<i>are</i> they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
c40394	So Azariah slept with his fathers;
c40395	and they buried him with his fathers in the city of David:
c40396	and Jotham his son reigned in his stead.
c40397	In the thirty and eighth year of Azariah king of Judah did Zachariah the son of Jeroboam reign over Israel in Samaria six months.
c40398	And he did
c40399	<i>that which was</i> evil in the sight of the LORD,
c40400	as his fathers had done:
c40401	he departed not from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat,
c40402	who made Israel to sin.
c40403	And Shallum the son of Jabesh conspired against
c40404	him, and smote him before the people,
c40405	and slew
c40406	him, and reigned in his stead.
c40407	And the rest of the acts of Zachariah,
c40408	behold, they <i>are</i> written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel.
c40409	This <i>was</i> the word of the LORD
c40410	which he spake unto Jehu,
c40411	saying,
c40412	Thy sons shall sit on the throne of Israel unto the fourth
c40413	<i>generation.</i> And so it came to pass.
c40414	Shallum the son of Jabesh began to reign in the nine and thirtieth year of Uzziah king of Judah;
c40415	and he reigned a full month in Samaria.
c40416	For Menahem the son of Gadi went up from Tirzah,
c40417	and came to Samaria,
c40418	and smote Shallum the son of Jabesh in Samaria,
c40419	and slew
c40420	him, and reigned in his stead.
c40421	And the rest of the acts of Shallum, and his conspiracy
c40422	which he made,
c40423	behold, they <i>are</i> written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel.
c40424	Then Menahem smote Tiphsah, and all
c40425	that
c40426	<i>were</i> therein, and the coasts thereof from Tirzah:
c40427	because they opened not
c40428	<i>to him,</i> therefore he smote
c40429	<i>it; and</i> all the women therein that were with child he ripped up.
c40430	In the nine and thirtieth year of Azariah king of Judah began Menahem the son of Gadi to reign over Israel, <i>and reigned</i> ten years in Samaria.
c40431	And he did
c40432	<i>that which was</i> evil in the sight of the LORD:
c40433	he departed not all his days from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat,
c40434	who made Israel to sin.
c40436	<i>And</i> Pul the king of Assyria came against the land:
c40437	and Menahem gave Pul a thousand talents of silver,
c40438	that his hand might be with
c40439	him to confirm the kingdom in his hand.
c40440	And Menahem exacted the money of Israel, <i>even</i> of all the mighty men of wealth,
c40441	to give to the king of Assyria.
c40442	of each man fifty shekels of silver,
c40443	So the king of Assyria turned back,
c40444	and stayed not there in the land.
c40445	And the rest of the acts of Menahem, and all
c40446	that he did,
c40447	<i>are</i> they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
c40448	And Menahem slept with his fathers;
c40449	and Pekahiah his son reigned in his stead.
c40450	In the fiftieth year of Azariah king of Judah Pekahiah the son of Menahem began to reign over Israel in Samaria, <i>and reigned</i> two years.
c40451	And he did
c40452	<i>that which was</i> evil in the sight of the LORD:
c40453	he departed not from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat,
c40454	who made Israel to sin.
c40455	But Pekah the son of Remaliah, a captain of his, conspired against
c40456	him, and smote him in Samaria, in the palace of the king's house, with Argob and Arieh,
c40457	and with him fifty men of the Gileadites:
c40458	and he killed
c40459	him, and reigned in his room.
c40460	And the rest of the acts of Pekahiah, and all
c40461	that he did,
c40462	behold, they <i>are</i> written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel.
c40463	In the two and fiftieth year of Azariah king of Judah Pekah the son of Remaliah began to reign over Israel in Samaria, <i>and reigned</i> twenty years.
c40464	And he did
c40465	<i>that which was</i> evil in the sight of the LORD:
c40466	he departed not from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat,
c40467	who made Israel to sin.
c40468	In the days of Pekah king of Israel came Tiglathpileser king of Assyria,
c40469	and took Ijon, and Abelbethmaachah, and Janoah, and Kedesh, and Hazor, and Gilead, and Galilee, all the land of Naphtali,
c40470	and carried them captive to Assyria.
c40471	And Hoshea the son of Elah made a conspiracy against Pekah the son of Remaliah,
c40472	and smote
c40473	him, and slew
c40474	him, and reigned in his stead, in the twentieth year of Jotham the son of Uzziah.
c40475	And the rest of the acts of Pekah, and all
c40476	that he did,
c40477	behold, they <i>are</i> written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel.
c40478	In the second year of Pekah the son of Remaliah king of Israel began Jotham the son of Uzziah king of Judah to reign.
c40479	Five and twenty years old was
c40480	he when he began to reign,
c40481	and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem.
c40482	And his mother's name <i>was</i> Jerusha, the daughter of Zadok.
c40483	And he did
c40484	<i>that which was</i> right in the sight of the LORD:
c40486	he did according to all that his father Uzziah
c40487	had done.
c40488	Howbeit the high places were not removed:
c40489	the people sacrificed and burned incense still
c40490	in the high places.
c40491	He built the higher gate of the house of the LORD.
c40492	Now the rest of the acts of Jotham,
c40493	and all that he did,
c40494	<i>are</i> they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
c40495	In those days the LORD began
c40496	to send against Judah Rezin the king of Syria, and Pekah the son of Remaliah.
c40497	And Jotham slept with his fathers,
c40498	and was buried with his fathers in the city of David his father:
c40499	and Ahaz his son reigned in his stead.
c40500	In the seventeenth year of Pekah the son of Remaliah Ahaz the son of Jotham king of Judah began to reign.
c40501	Twenty years old <i>was</i> Ahaz
c40502	when he began to reign,
c40503	and reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem,
c40504	and did not
c40505	<i>that which was</i> right in the sight of the LORD his God,
c40506	like David his father.
c40507	But he walked in the way of the kings of Israel,
c40508	yea, and made his son to pass through the fire, according to the abominations of the heathen,
c40509	whom the LORD cast out from before the children of Israel.
c40510	And he sacrificed
c40511	and burnt incense in the high places, and on the hills, and under every green tree.
c40512	Then Rezin king of Syria and Pekah son of Remaliah king of Israel came up to Jerusalem to war:
c40513	and they besieged Ahaz,
c40514	but could not
c40515	overcome <i>him.</i>
c40516	At that time Rezin king of Syria recovered Elath to Syria,
c40517	and drave the Jews from Elath:
c40518	and the Syrians came to Elath,
c40519	and dwelt there unto this day.
c40520	So Ahaz sent messengers to Tiglathpileser king of Assyria,
c40521	saying,
c40522	I <i>am</i> thy servant and thy son:
c40523	come up,
c40524	and save me out of the hand of the king of Syria, and out of the hand of the king of Israel,
c40525	which rise up against me.
c40526	And Ahaz took the silver and gold
c40527	that was found in the house of the LORD, and in the treasures of the king's house,
c40528	and sent <i>it for</i> a present to the king of Assyria.
c40529	And the king of Assyria hearkened unto
c40530	him: for the king of Assyria went up against Damascus,
c40531	and took
c40532	it, and carried <i>the people of</i> it captive to Kir,
c40533	and slew Rezin.
c40534	And king Ahaz went
c40535	to meet Tiglathpileser king of Assyria,
c40536	to Damascus
c40537	and saw an altar
c40538	that <i>was</i> at Damascus:
c40539	and king Ahaz sent to Urijah the priest the fashion of the altar, and the pattern of it, according to all the workmanship thereof.
c40540	And Urijah the priest built an altar
c40541	according to all
c40542	that king Ahaz had sent from Damascus:
c40543	so Urijah the priest made
c40544	<i>it</i> against king Ahaz came from Damascus.
c40545	And when the king was come from Damascus,
c40546	the king saw the altar:
c40547	and the king approached to the altar,
c40548	and offered thereon.
c40549	And he burnt his burnt offering and his meat offering,
c40550	and poured his drink offering,
c40551	and sprinkled the blood of his peace offerings,
c40553	upon the altar.
c40555	which <i>was</i> before the LORD, from the forefront of the house, from between the altar and the house of the LORD,
c40556	And he brought also the brasen altar,
c40557	and put it on the north side of the altar.
c40558	And king Ahaz commanded Urijah the priest,
c40559	saying,
c40560	Upon the great altar burn the morning burnt offering, and the evening meat offering, and the king's burnt sacrifice, and his meat offering, with the burnt offering of all the people of the land, and their meat offering, and their drink offerings;
c40561	and sprinkle upon it all the blood of the burnt offering, and all the blood of the sacrifice:
c40562	and the brasen altar shall be
c40563	for me to enquire <i>by.</i>
c40564	Thus did Urijah the priest, according to all
c40565	that king Ahaz commanded.
c40566	And king Ahaz cut off the borders of the bases,
c40567	and removed the laver from off
c40568	them; and took down the sea from off the brasen oxen
c40569	that <i>were</i> under
c40570	it, and put it upon a pavement of stones.
c40571	And the covert for the sabbath
c40572	that they had built in the house,
c40573	and the king's entry without, turned he from the house of the LORD for the king of Assyria.
c40574	Now the rest of the acts of Ahaz
c40575	which he did,
c40576	<i>are</i> they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
c40577	And Ahaz slept with his fathers,
c40578	and was buried with his fathers in the city of David:
c40579	and Hezekiah his son reigned in his stead.
c40580	In the twelfth year of Ahaz king of Judah began Hoshea the son of Elah to reign in Samaria over Israel nine years.
c40581	And he did
c40582	<i>that which was</i> evil in the sight of the LORD,
c40583	but not as the kings of Israel
c40584	that were before him.
c40585	Against him came up Shalmaneser king of Assyria;
c40586	and Hoshea became his servant,
c40587	and gave him presents.
c40588	And the king of Assyria found conspiracy in Hoshea:
c40589	for he had sent messengers to So king of Egypt,
c40590	and brought no present to the king of Assyria, as <i>he had done</i> year by year:
c40591	therefore the king of Assyria shut him up,
c40592	and bound him in prison.
c40593	Then the king of Assyria came up throughout all the land,
c40594	and went up to Samaria,
c40595	and besieged it three years.
c40596	In the ninth year of Hoshea the king of Assyria took Samaria,
c40597	and carried Israel away into Assyria,
c40598	and placed them in Halah and in Habor <i>by</i> the river of Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes.
c40599	For <i>so</i> it was,
c40600	that the children of Israel had sinned against the LORD their God,
c40601	which had brought them up out of the land of Egypt, from under the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt,
c40602	and had feared other gods,
c40603	And walked in the statutes of the heathen,
c40604	whom the LORD cast out from before the children of Israel,
c40605	and of the kings of Israel,
c40606	which they had made.
c40607	And the children of Israel did secretly <i>those</i> things
c40608	that <i>were</i> not right
c40609	against the LORD their God,
c40610	and they built them high places in all their cities, from the tower of the watchmen to the fenced city.
c40611	And they set them up images and groves in every high hill, and under every green tree:
c40612	And there they burnt incense in all the high places, as <i>did</i> the heathen
c40613	whom the LORD carried away before
c40614	them; and wrought wicked things
c40615	to provoke the LORD to anger:
c40616	For they served idols,
c40617	whereof the LORD had said
c40618	unto them, Ye shall not do this thing.
c40619	Yet the LORD testified against Israel, and against Judah, by all the prophets, <i>and by</i> all the seers,
c40620	saying,
c40621	Turn ye from your evil ways,
c40622	and keep my commandments <i>and</i> my statutes, according to all the law
c40623	which I commanded your fathers,
c40624	and which I sent to you by my servants the prophets.
c40625	Notwithstanding they would not hear,
c40626	but hardened their necks, like to the neck of their fathers,
c40627	that did not believe in the LORD their God.
c40628	And they rejected his statutes, and his covenant
c40629	that he made with their fathers,
c40630	and his testimonies
c40631	which he testified
c40632	against them; and they followed vanity,
c40633	and became vain,
c40634	and went after the heathen
c40635	that <i>were</i> round about
c40636	them, <i>concerning</i> whom the LORD had charged
c40637	them, that they should not do like them.
c40638	And they left all the commandments of the LORD their God,
c40639	and made them molten images, <i>even</i> two calves,
c40640	and made a grove,
c40641	and worshipped all the host of heaven,
c40642	and served Baal.
c40643	And they caused their sons and their daughters to pass through the fire,
c40644	and used divination
c40645	and enchantments,
c40646	and sold themselves
c40647	to do
c40648	evil in the sight of the LORD,
c40649	to provoke him to anger.
c40650	Therefore the LORD was very angry with Israel,
c40651	and removed them out of his sight:
c40652	there was none left but the tribe of Judah only.
c40653	Also Judah kept not the commandments of the LORD their God,
c40654	but walked in the statutes of Israel
c40655	which they made.
c40656	And the LORD rejected all the seed of Israel,
c40657	and afflicted
c40658	them, and delivered them into the hand of spoilers,
c40659	until he had cast them out of his sight.
c40660	For he rent Israel from the house of David;
c40661	and they made Jeroboam the son of Nebat king:
c40662	and Jeroboam drave Israel from following the LORD,
c40663	and made them sin a great sin.
c40664	For the children of Israel walked in all the sins of Jeroboam
c40665	which he did;
c40666	they departed not from them;
c40667	Until the LORD removed Israel out of his sight,
c40668	as he had said by all his servants the prophets.
c40669	So was Israel carried away out of their own land to Assyria unto this day.
c40670	And the king of Assyria brought <i>men</i> from Babylon, and from Cuthah, and from Ava, and from Hamath, and from Sepharvaim,
c40671	and placed <i>them</i> in the cities of Samaria instead of the children of Israel:
c40672	and they possessed Samaria,
c40673	and dwelt in the cities thereof.
c40674	And <i>so</i> it was
c40675	at the beginning of their dwelling there,
c40676	<i>that</i> they feared not the LORD:
c40677	therefore the LORD sent lions
c40678	among them, which slew <i>some</i> of them.
c40679	Wherefore they spake to the king of Assyria,
c40680	saying,
c40681	The nations
c40682	which thou hast removed,
c40683	and placed in the cities of Samaria,
c40684	know not the manner of the God of the land:
c40685	therefore he hath sent lions
c40686	among them, and, behold, they slay
c40687	them, because they know not the manner of the God of the land.
c40688	Then the king of Assyria commanded,
c40689	saying,
c40690	Carry thither one of the priests
c40691	whom ye brought from thence;
c40692	and let them go
c40693	and dwell there,
c40694	and let him teach them the manner of the God of the land.
c40695	Then one of the priests whom they had carried away from Samaria came
c40697	and dwelt in Bethel,
c40698	and taught
c40699	them how they should fear the LORD.
c40700	Howbeit every nation made gods
c40701	of their own, and put <i>them</i> in the houses of the high places
c40702	which the Samaritans had made,
c40703	every nation in their cities
c40704	wherein they dwelt.
c40705	And the men of Babylon made Succothbenoth,
c40706	and the men of Cuth made Nergal,
c40707	and the men of Hamath made Ashima,
c40708	And the Avites made Nibhaz and Tartak,
c40709	and the Sepharvites burnt their children in fire to Adrammelech and Anammelech, the gods of Sepharvaim.
c40710	So they feared the LORD,
c40711	and made unto themselves of the lowest of them priests of the high places,
c40712	which sacrificed for them in the houses of the high places.
c40713	They feared the LORD,
c40714	and served their own gods, after the manner of the nations
c40715	whom they carried away from thence.
c40716	Unto this day they do after the former manners:
c40717	they fear not the LORD,
c40718	neither do they after their statutes, or after their ordinances, or after the law and commandment
c40719	which the LORD commanded the children of Jacob,
c40720	whom he named Israel;
c40721	With whom the LORD had made a covenant,
c40722	and charged
c40723	them, saying,
c40724	Ye shall not fear other gods,
c40725	nor bow yourselves
c40726	to them, nor serve
c40727	them, nor sacrifice to them:
c40728	But the LORD,
c40729	who brought you up out of the land of Egypt with great power and a stretched out arm,
c40730	him shall ye fear,
c40731	and him shall ye worship,
c40732	and to him shall ye do sacrifice.
c40733	And the statutes, and the ordinances, and the law, and the commandment,
c40734	which he wrote
c40735	for you, ye shall observe
c40736	to do for evermore;
c40737	and ye shall not fear other gods.
c40738	And the covenant
c40739	that I have made with
c40740	you ye shall not forget;
c40741	neither shall ye fear other gods.
c40742	But the LORD your God ye shall fear;
c40743	and he shall deliver you out of the hand of all your enemies.
c40744	Howbeit they did not hearken,
c40745	but they did after their former manner.
c40746	So these nations feared the LORD,
c40747	and served their graven images,
c40748	both their children, and their children's children:
c40749	as did their fathers,
c40750	so do they unto this day.
c40751	Now it came to pass in the third year of Hoshea son of Elah king of Israel,
c40752	<i>that</i> Hezekiah the son of Ahaz king of Judah began to reign.
c40753	Twenty and five years old was
c40754	he when he began to reign;
c40755	and he reigned twenty and nine years in Jerusalem.
c40756	His mother's name also <i>was</i> Abi, the daughter of Zachariah.
c40757	And he did
c40758	<i>that which was</i> right in the sight of the LORD,
c40759	according to all
c40760	that David his father did.
c40761	He removed the high places,
c40762	and brake the images,
c40763	and cut down the groves,
c40764	and brake in pieces the brasen serpent
c40765	that Moses had made:
c40766	for unto those days the children of Israel did
c40767	burn incense
c40768	to it: and he called it Nehushtan.
c40769	He trusted in the LORD God of Israel;
c40770	so that after him was none like him among all the kings of Judah,
c40771	nor <i>any</i> that were before him.
c40772	For he clave to the LORD,
c40773	<i>and</i> departed not from following
c40774	him, but kept his commandments,
c40775	which the LORD commanded Moses.
c40776	And the LORD was with
c40777	whithersoever
c40778	he went forth:
c40779	him; <i>and</i> he prospered
c40780	and he rebelled against the king of Assyria,
c40781	and served him not.
c40782	He smote the Philistines, <i>even</i> unto Gaza,
c40783	and the borders thereof, from the tower of the watchmen to the fenced city.
c40784	And it came to pass in the fourth year of king Hezekiah,
c40785	which <i>was</i> the seventh year of Hoshea son of Elah king of Israel,
c40786	<i>that</i> Shalmaneser king of Assyria came up against Samaria,
c40787	and besieged it.
c40788	And at the end of three years they took
c40789	it: <i>even</i> in the sixth year of Hezekiah,
c40790	that <i>is</i> the ninth year of Hoshea king of Israel,
c40791	Samaria was taken.
c40792	And the king of Assyria did carry away Israel unto Assyria,
c40793	and put them in Halah and in Habor <i>by</i> the river of Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes:
c40794	Because they obeyed not the voice of the LORD their God,
c40795	but transgressed his covenant, <i>and</i> all
c40796	that Moses the servant of the LORD commanded,
c40797	and would not hear
c40798	<i>them,</i> nor do <i>them.</i>
c40799	Now in the fourteenth year of king Hezekiah did Sennacherib king of Assyria come up against all the fenced cities of Judah,
c40800	and took them.
c40801	And Hezekiah king of Judah sent to the king of Assyria to Lachish,
c40802	saying,
c40803	I have offended;
c40804	return from
c40805	me: that which thou puttest on
c40806	me will I bear.
c40807	And the king of Assyria appointed unto Hezekiah king of Judah three hundred talents of silver and thirty talents of gold.
c40808	And Hezekiah gave <i>him</i> all the silver
c40809	that was found in the house of the LORD, and in the treasures of the king's house.
c40810	At that time did Hezekiah cut off <i>the gold from</i> the doors of the temple of the LORD, and <i>from</i> the pillars
c40811	which Hezekiah king of Judah had overlaid,
c40812	and gave it to the king of Assyria.
c40813	And the king of Assyria sent Tartan and Rabsaris and Rabshakeh from Lachish to king Hezekiah with a great host against Jerusalem.
c40814	And they went up
c40815	and came to Jerusalem.
c40816	And when they were come up,
c40817	they came
c40818	and stood by the conduit of the upper pool,
c40819	which <i>is</i> in the highway of the fuller's field.
c40820	And when they had called to the king,
c40821	there came out to them Eliakim the son of Hilkiah,
c40822	which <i>was</i> over the household,
c40823	and Shebna the scribe, and Joah the son of Asaph the recorder.
c40824	And Rabshakeh said unto
c40825	them, Speak ye now to Hezekiah,
c40826	Thus saith the great king, the king of Assyria,
c40827	What confidence <i>is</i> this
c40828	wherein thou trustest?
c40829	Thou sayest,
c40830	(but <i>they are but</i> vain words,) <i>I have</i> counsel and strength for the war.
c40831	Now
c40832	on whom dost thou trust,
c40833	that thou rebellest against me?
c40834	Now,
c40835	behold, thou trustest upon the staff of this bruised reed, <i>even</i> upon Egypt,
c40836	on which if a man lean,
c40837	it will go into his hand,
c40838	and pierce
c40839	it: so <i>is</i> Pharaoh king of Egypt unto all
c40840	that trust on him.
c40841	But if ye say unto
c40842	me, We trust in the LORD our God:
c40843	<i>is</i> not that he,
c40844	whose high places and whose altars Hezekiah hath taken away,
c40845	and hath said to Judah and Jerusalem,
c40846	Ye shall worship before this altar in Jerusalem?
c40847	Now
c40848	therefore, I pray thee, give pledges to my lord the king of Assyria,
c40849	and I will deliver thee two thousand horses,
c40850	if thou be able
c40851	on thy part to set riders upon them.
c40852	How then wilt thou turn away the face of one captain of the least of my master's servants,
c40853	and put thy trust on Egypt for chariots and for horsemen?
c40854	Am I now
c40855	come up without the LORD against this place
c40856	to destroy
c40857	it? The LORD said to
c40858	me, Go up against this land,
c40859	and destroy it.
c40860	Then said Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, and Shebna, and Joah, unto Rabshakeh,
c40861	Speak, I pray thee, to thy servants in the Syrian language;
c40862	for we understand
c40863	<i>it:</i> and talk not with us in the Jews' language in the ears of the people
c40864	that <i>are</i> on the wall.
c40865	But Rabshakeh said unto
c40866	them, Hath my master sent me to thy master, and to
c40867	thee, to speak these words?
c40868	<i>hath he</i> not <i>sent me</i> to the men
c40869	which sit on the wall,
c40870	that they may eat their own dung,
c40871	and drink their own piss with you?
c40872	Then Rabshakeh stood
c40873	and cried with a loud voice in the Jews' language,
c40874	and spake,
c40875	saying,
c40876	Hear the word of the great king, the king of Assyria:
c40877	Thus saith the king,
c40878	Let not Hezekiah deceive
c40879	you: for he shall not be able
c40880	to deliver you out of his hand:
c40881	Neither let Hezekiah make you trust in the LORD,
c40882	saying,
c40883	The LORD will surely deliver
c40884	us, and this city shall not be delivered into the hand of the king of Assyria.
c40885	Hearken not to Hezekiah:
c40886	for thus saith the king of Assyria,
c40887	Make <i>an agreement</i> with me by a present,
c40888	and come out to
c40889	me, and <i>then</i> eat ye every man of his own vine,
c40890	and every one of his fig tree,
c40891	and drink ye every one the waters of his cistern:
c40892	Until I come
c40893	and take you away to a land like your own land, a land of corn and wine, a land of bread and vineyards, a land of oil olive and of honey,
c40894	that ye may live,
c40895	and not die:
c40896	and hearken not unto Hezekiah,
c40897	when he persuadeth
c40898	you, saying,
c40899	The LORD will deliver us.
c40901	Hath any of the gods of the nations delivered at all his land
c40902	out of the hand of the king of Assyria?
c40903	Where <i>are</i> the gods of Hamath, and of Arpad?
c40904	where <i>are</i> the gods of Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivah?
c40905	have they delivered Samaria out of mine hand?
c40906	Who <i>are</i> they among all the gods of the countries,
c40907	that have delivered their country out of mine hand,
c40908	that the LORD should deliver Jerusalem out of mine hand?
c40909	But the people held their peace,
c40910	and answered him not a word:
c40911	for the king's commandment
c40912	was, saying,
c40913	Answer him not.
c40914	Then came Eliakim the son of Hilkiah,
c40915	which <i>was</i> over the household,
c40916	and Shebna the scribe, and Joah the son of Asaph the recorder, to Hezekiah with <i>their</i> clothes rent,
c40917	and told him the words of Rabshakeh.
c40918	And it came to pass,
c40919	when king Hezekiah heard
c40920	<i>it,</i> that he rent his clothes,
c40921	and covered himself with sackcloth,
c40922	and went into the house of the LORD.
c40923	And he sent Eliakim,
c40924	which <i>was</i> over the household,
c40925	and Shebna the scribe, and the elders of the priests,
c40926	covered with sackcloth,
c40927	to Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz.
c40928	And they said unto
c40929	him, Thus saith Hezekiah,
c40930	This day <i>is</i> a day of trouble, and of rebuke, and blasphemy:
c40931	for the children are come to the birth,
c40932	and <i>there is</i> not strength to bring forth.
c40933	It may be the LORD thy God will hear all the words of Rabshakeh,
c40934	whom the king of Assyria his master hath sent
c40935	to reproach the living God;
c40936	and will reprove the words
c40937	which the LORD thy God hath heard:
c40938	wherefore lift up <i>thy</i> prayer for the remnant
c40939	that are left.
c40940	So the servants of king Hezekiah came to Isaiah.
c40941	And Isaiah said
c40942	unto them, Thus shall ye say to your master,
c40943	Thus saith the LORD,
c40944	Be not afraid of the words
c40945	which thou hast heard,
c40946	with which the servants of the king of Assyria have blasphemed me.
c40947	Behold, I will send a blast
c40948	upon him, and he shall hear a rumour,
c40949	and shall return to his own land;
c40950	and I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land.
c40951	So Rabshakeh returned,
c40952	and found the king of Assyria
c40953	warring against Libnah:
c40954	for he had heard
c40955	that he was departed from Lachish.
c40956	And when he heard say of Tirhakah king of Ethiopia,
c40958	Behold, he is come out
c40959	to fight against
c40961	thee: he sent messengers again unto Hezekiah,
c40962	saying,
c40963	Thus shall ye speak to Hezekiah king of Judah,
c40964	saying,
c40965	Let not thy God in whom thou trustest deceive
c40967	thee, saying,
c40968	Jerusalem shall not be delivered into the hand of the king of Assyria.
c40969	Behold, thou hast heard
c40970	what the kings of Assyria have done to all lands,
c40971	by destroying them utterly:
c40972	and shalt thou be delivered?
c40973	Have the gods of the nations delivered
c40974	them which my fathers have destroyed;
c40975	<i>as</i> Gozan, and Haran, and Rezeph, and the children of Eden
c40976	which <i>were</i> in Thelasar?
c40977	Where <i>is</i> the king of Hamath, and the king of Arpad, and the king of the city of Sepharvaim, of Hena, and Ivah?
c40978	And Hezekiah received the letter of the hand of the messengers,
c40979	and read
c40981	it: and Hezekiah went up into the house of the LORD, and spread it before the LORD.
c40982	And Hezekiah prayed before the LORD,
c40983	and said,
c40984	O LORD God of Israel,
c40985	which dwellest <i>between</i> the cherubims,
c40986	thou art the God, <i>even</i> thou alone, of all the kingdoms of the earth;
c40987	thou hast made heaven and earth.
c40988	bow down
c40989	LORD,
c40990	thine ear,
c40991	and hear:
c40992	open,
c40993	LORD,
c40994	thine eyes,
c40995	and see:
c40996	and hear the words of Sennacherib,
c40997	which hath sent
c40998	him to reproach the living God.
c40999	Of a truth, LORD,
c41000	the kings of Assyria have destroyed the nations and their lands,
c41001	And have cast their gods into the fire:
c41002	for they <i>were</i> no gods,
c41003	but the work of men's hands, wood and stone:
c41004	therefore they have destroyed them.
c41005	Now
c41006	therefore, O LORD our God,
c41007	I beseech thee, save thou us out of his hand,
c41008	that all the kingdoms of the earth may know
c41009	that thou <i>art</i> the LORD God, <i>even</i> thou only.
c41010	Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent to Hezekiah,
c41011	saying,
c41012	Thus saith the LORD God of Israel,
c41013	<i>That</i> which thou hast prayed to me against Sennacherib king of Assyria
c41014	I have heard.
c41015	This <i>is</i> the word
c41016	that the LORD hath spoken concerning
c41018	him; The virgin the daughter of Zion hath despised thee, <i>and</i> laughed thee to scorn;
c41019	the daughter of Jerusalem hath shaken her head at thee.
c41020	Whom hast thou reproached
c41021	and blasphemed?
c41022	and against whom hast thou exalted <i>thy</i> voice,
c41023	and lifted up thine eyes on high?
c41024	<i>even</i> against the Holy <i>One</i> of Israel.
c41025	By thy messengers thou hast reproached the Lord,
c41026	and hast said,
c41027	With the multitude of my chariots I am come up to the height of the mountains, to the sides of Lebanon,
c41028	and will cut down the tall cedar trees thereof, <i>and</i> the choice fir trees
c41029	thereof: and I will enter into the lodgings of his borders, <i>and into</i> the forest of his Carmel.
c41030	I have digged
c41031	and drunk strange waters,
c41032	and with the sole of my feet have I dried up all the rivers of besieged places.
c41033	Hast thou not heard long ago
c41034	<i>how</i> I have done it, <i>and</i> of ancient times
c41035	that I have formed
c41036	it? now have I brought it to pass,
c41037	that thou shouldest be
c41038	to lay waste fenced cities <i>into</i> ruinous heaps.
c41039	Therefore their inhabitants were of small power,
c41040	they were dismayed
c41041	and confounded;
c41042	they were <i>as</i> the grass of the field, and <i>as</i> the green herb,
c41043	<i>as</i> the grass on the housetops, and <i>as corn</i> blasted before it be grown up.
c41045	thy abode,
c41046	and thy going out,
c41047	and thy coming in,
c41048	But I know
c41050	and thy rage against me.
c41051	Because thy rage against
c41052	me and thy tumult is come up into mine ears,
c41053	therefore I will put my hook in thy nose,
c41054	and my bridle in thy lips,
c41055	and I will turn thee back by the way
c41056	by which thou camest.
c41057	And this <i>shall be</i> a sign
c41058	unto thee, Ye shall eat this year such things as grow of themselves,
c41059	and in the second year that which springeth of the same;
c41060	and in the third year sow
c41061	ye, and reap,
c41062	and plant vineyards,
c41063	and eat the fruits thereof.
c41064	And the remnant that is escaped of the house of Judah shall yet again take root downward,
c41065	and bear fruit upward.
c41066	For out of Jerusalem shall go forth a remnant,
c41067	and they that escape out of mount Zion:
c41068	the zeal of the LORD <i>of hosts</i> shall do this.
c41069	Therefore
c41070	thus saith the LORD concerning the king of Assyria,
c41071	He shall not come into this city,
c41072	nor shoot an arrow there,
c41073	nor come before it with shield,
c41074	nor cast a bank against it.
c41075	By the way
c41076	that he came,
c41077	by the same shall he return,
c41078	and shall not come into this city,
c41079	saith the LORD.
c41080	For I will defend this city,
c41081	to save
c41082	it, for mine own sake, and for my servant David's sake.
c41083	And it came to pass that night,
c41084	that the angel of the LORD went out,
c41085	and smote in the camp of the Assyrians an hundred fourscore and five thousand:
c41086	and when they arose early in the morning,
c41087	behold, they <i>were</i> all dead corpses.
c41089	and went and returned,
c41090	So Sennacherib king of Assyria departed,
c41091	and dwelt at Nineveh.
c41092	And it came to pass,
c41093	as he was worshipping in the house of Nisroch his god,
c41094	that Adrammelech and Sharezer his sons smote him with the sword:
c41095	and they escaped into the land of Armenia.
c41096	And Esarhaddon his son reigned in his stead.
c41097	In those days was Hezekiah sick
c41098	unto death.
c41099	And the prophet Isaiah the son of Amoz came to
c41100	him, and said unto
c41101	him, Thus saith the LORD,
c41102	Set thine house in order;
c41103	for thou shalt die,
c41104	and not live.
c41105	Then he turned his face to the wall,
c41106	and prayed unto the LORD,
c41107	saying,
c41108	I beseech thee, O LORD,
c41109	remember now
c41110	how I have walked before thee in truth and with a perfect heart,
c41111	and have done <i>that which is</i> good in thy sight.
c41112	And Hezekiah wept sore.
c41113	And it came to pass,
c41114	afore Isaiah was gone out into the middle court,
c41115	that the word of the LORD came to
c41116	him, saying,
c41117	Turn again,
c41118	and tell Hezekiah the captain of my people,
c41119	Thus saith the LORD, the God of David thy father,
c41120	I have heard thy prayer,
c41121	I have seen thy tears:
c41122	behold, I will heal
c41123	thee: on the third day thou shalt go up unto the house of the LORD.
c41124	And I will add unto thy days fifteen years;
c41125	and I will deliver thee and this city out of the hand of the king of Assyria;
c41127	and I will defend this city for mine own sake, and for my servant David's sake.
c41128	And Isaiah said,
c41129	Take a lump of figs.
c41130	And they took
c41131	and laid <i>it</i> on the boil,
c41132	and he recovered.
c41133	And Hezekiah said unto Isaiah,
c41134	What <i>shall be</i> the sign
c41135	that the LORD will heal
c41136	me, and that I shall go up into the house of the LORD the third day?
c41137	And Isaiah said,
c41138	This sign shalt thou have of the LORD,
c41139	that the LORD will do the thing
c41140	that he hath spoken:
c41141	shall the shadow go forward ten degrees,
c41142	or go back ten degrees?
c41143	And Hezekiah answered,
c41144	It is a light thing for the shadow
c41145	to go down ten degrees:
c41146	nay,
c41147	but let the shadow return backward ten degrees.
c41148	And Isaiah the prophet cried unto the LORD:
c41149	and he brought the shadow
c41150	of Ahaz.
c41151	ten degrees backward, by which it had gone down in the dial
c41152	At that time Berodachbaladan, the son of Baladan, king of Babylon, sent letters and a present unto Hezekiah:
c41153	for he had heard
c41154	that Hezekiah had been sick.
c41155	And Hezekiah hearkened unto
c41156	them, and shewed them all the house of his precious things, the silver, and the gold, and the spices, and the precious ointment, and <i>all</i> the house of his armour, and all
c41157	that was found in his treasures:
c41158	there was nothing
c41159	that Hezekiah shewed them not.
c41160	in his house, nor in all his dominion,
c41161	Then came Isaiah the prophet unto king Hezekiah,
c41162	and said unto
c41163	him, What said these men?
c41164	and from whence came they unto
c41165	thee? And Hezekiah said,
c41166	They are come from a far country, <i>even</i> from Babylon.
c41167	And he said,
c41168	What have they seen in thine house?
c41169	And Hezekiah answered,
c41170	All
c41171	<i>the things</i> that <i>are</i> in mine house
c41172	have they seen:
c41173	there is nothing
c41174	that I have not shewed them.
c41175	among my treasures
c41176	And Isaiah said unto Hezekiah,
c41177	Hear the word of the LORD.
c41178	Behold, the days come,
c41179	that all that <i>is</i> in thine house,
c41181	and that which thy fathers have laid up in store unto this day, shall be carried
c41182	into Babylon:
c41183	nothing shall be left,
c41184	saith the LORD.
c41185	And of thy sons
c41186	that shall issue from
c41187	thee, which thou shalt beget,
c41188	shall they take away;
c41189	and they shall be eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon.
c41190	Then said Hezekiah unto Isaiah,
c41191	Good <i>is</i> the word of the LORD
c41192	which thou hast spoken.
c41193	And he said,
c41194	<i>Is it</i> not
c41195	<i>good,</i> if peace and truth be in my days?
c41196	And the rest of the acts of Hezekiah, and all his might,
c41197	and how he made a pool, and a conduit,
c41198	and brought water into the city,
c41199	<i>are</i> they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
c41200	And Hezekiah slept with his fathers:
c41201	and Manasseh his son reigned in his stead.
c41202	Manasseh <i>was</i> twelve years old
c41203	when he began to reign,
c41204	and reigned fifty and five years in Jerusalem.
c41205	And his mother's name <i>was</i> Hephzibah.
c41206	And he did
c41207	<i>that which was</i> evil in the sight of the LORD,
c41208	after the abominations of the heathen,
c41209	whom the LORD cast out before the children of Israel.
c41211	For he built up again the high places
c41212	which Hezekiah his father had destroyed;
c41213	and he reared up altars for Baal,
c41214	and made a grove,
c41215	as did Ahab king of Israel;
c41216	and worshipped all the host of heaven,
c41217	and served them.
c41218	And he built altars in the house of the LORD,
c41219	of which the LORD said,
c41220	In Jerusalem will I put my name.
c41221	And he built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts of the house of the LORD.
c41222	And he made his son pass through the fire,
c41223	and observed times,
c41224	and used enchantments,
c41225	and dealt with familiar spirits and wizards:
c41226	much
c41227	he wrought
c41228	wickedness in the sight of the LORD,
c41229	to provoke <i>him</i> to anger.
c41230	And he set a graven image of the grove
c41231	that he had made
c41232	in the house,
c41233	of which the LORD said to David, and to Solomon his son,
c41234	In this house, and in Jerusalem,
c41235	which I have chosen out of all tribes of Israel,
c41236	will I put my name for ever:
c41237	Neither will I make the feet of Israel move any more
c41238	out of the land
c41239	which I gave their fathers;
c41240	only if they will observe
c41241	to do according to all
c41242	that I have commanded
c41243	them, and according to all the law
c41244	that my servant Moses commanded them.
c41245	But they hearkened not:
c41246	and Manasseh seduced
c41247	them to do
c41248	more evil than did the nations
c41249	whom the LORD destroyed before the children of Israel.
c41250	And the LORD spake by his servants the prophets,
c41251	saying,
c41252	Because Manasseh king of Judah hath done these abominations,
c41253	<i>and</i> hath done wickedly above all
c41254	that the Amorites did,
c41255	which <i>were</i> before
c41256	him, and hath made Judah also to sin with his idols:
c41257	Therefore
c41258	thus saith the LORD God of Israel,
c41259	Behold, I <i>am</i> bringing <i>such</i> evil upon Jerusalem and Judah,
c41260	that whosoever heareth
c41261	of it, both his ears shall tingle.
c41262	And I will stretch over Jerusalem the line of Samaria, and the plummet of the house of Ahab:
c41263	and I will wipe Jerusalem
c41264	as <i>a man</i> wipeth a dish,
c41265	wiping
c41266	<i>it,</i> and turning <i>it</i> upside down.
c41267	And I will forsake the remnant of mine inheritance,
c41268	and deliver them into the hand of their enemies;
c41269	and they shall become a prey and a spoil to all their enemies;
c41270	Because they have done <i>that which was</i> evil in my sight,
c41271	and have provoked me to anger, since the day
c41272	their fathers came forth out of Egypt,
c41273	even unto this day.
c41274	Moreover Manasseh shed innocent blood very much,
c41275	till he had filled Jerusalem from one end to another; beside his sin
c41276	wherewith he made Judah to sin,
c41277	in doing
c41278	<i>that which was</i> evil in the sight of the LORD.
c41279	Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh, and all
c41280	that he did,
c41281	and his sin
c41282	that he sinned,
c41283	<i>are</i> they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
c41284	And Manasseh slept with his fathers,
c41285	and was buried in the garden of his own house, in the garden of Uzza:
c41286	and Amon his son reigned in his stead.
c41287	Amon <i>was</i> twenty and two years old
c41288	when he began to reign,
c41289	and he reigned two years in Jerusalem.
c41290	And his mother's name <i>was</i> Meshullemeth, the daughter of Haruz of Jotbah.
c41291	And he did
c41292	<i>that which was</i> evil in the sight of the LORD,
c41293	as his father Manasseh did.
c41294	And he walked in all the way
c41295	that his father walked in,
c41296	and served the idols
c41297	that his father served,
c41298	and worshipped them:
c41299	And he forsook the LORD God of his fathers,
c41300	and walked not in the way of the LORD.
c41301	And the servants of Amon conspired against
c41302	him, and slew the king in his own house.
c41303	And the people of the land slew all
c41304	them that had conspired against king Amon;
c41305	and the people of the land made Josiah his son king in his stead.
c41306	Now the rest of the acts of Amon
c41307	which he did,
c41308	<i>are</i> they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
c41309	And he was buried in his sepulchre in the garden of Uzza:
c41310	and Josiah his son reigned in his stead.
c41311	Josiah <i>was</i> eight years old
c41312	when he began to reign,
c41313	and he reigned thirty and one years in Jerusalem.
c41314	And his mother's name <i>was</i> Jedidah, the daughter of Adaiah of Boscath.
c41315	And he did
c41316	<i>that which was</i> right in the sight of the LORD,
c41317	and walked in all the way of David his father,
c41318	and turned not aside to the right hand or to the left.
c41319	And it came to pass in the eighteenth year of king Josiah,
c41320	<i>that</i> the king sent Shaphan the son of Azaliah, the son of Meshullam, the scribe, to the house of the LORD,
c41321	saying,
c41322	Go up to Hilkiah the high priest,
c41323	that he may sum the silver
c41324	which is brought into the house of the LORD,
c41325	which the keepers of the door have gathered of the people:
c41326	And let them deliver it into the hand of the doers of the work,
c41327	that have the oversight of the house of the LORD:
c41328	and let them give it to the doers of the work
c41329	which <i>is</i> in the house of the LORD,
c41330	to repair the breaches of the house,
c41331	Unto carpenters, and builders, and masons,
c41332	and to buy timber and hewn stone
c41333	to repair the house.
c41334	Howbeit there was no reckoning made with them of the money
c41335	that was delivered into their hand,
c41336	because they dealt faithfully.
c41337	And Hilkiah the high priest said unto Shaphan the scribe,
c41338	I have found the book of the law in the house of the LORD.
c41339	And Hilkiah gave the book to Shaphan,
c41340	and he read it.
c41341	And Shaphan the scribe came to the king,
c41342	and brought the king word again,
c41343	and said,
c41344	Thy servants have gathered the money
c41345	that was found in the house,
c41346	and have delivered it into the hand of them that do the work,
c41347	that have the oversight of the house of the LORD.
c41348	And Shaphan the scribe shewed the king,
c41349	saying,
c41350	Hilkiah the priest hath delivered me a book.
c41351	And Shaphan read it before the king.
c41352	And it came to pass,
c41353	when the king had heard the words of the book of the law,
c41354	that he rent his clothes.
c41355	And the king commanded Hilkiah the priest, and Ahikam the son of Shaphan, and Achbor the son of Michaiah, and Shaphan the scribe, and Asahiah a servant of the king's,
c41356	saying,
c41357	Go
c41358	ye, enquire of the LORD for me, and for the people, and for all Judah, concerning the words of this book that is found:
c41359	for great <i>is</i> the wrath of the LORD
c41360	that is kindled
c41361	against us, because our fathers have not hearkened unto the words of this book,
c41362	to do according unto all
c41363	that which is written concerning us.
c41364	So Hilkiah the priest, and Ahikam, and Achbor, and Shaphan, and Asahiah, went unto Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son of Tikvah, the son of Harhas,
c41365	keeper of the wardrobe;
c41366	(now she dwelt in Jerusalem in the college;)
c41367	and they communed with her.
c41368	And she said unto
c41369	them, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel,
c41370	Tell the man
c41371	that sent you to me,
c41372	Thus saith the LORD,
c41373	Behold, I will bring evil upon this place, and upon the inhabitants thereof, <i>even</i> all the words of the book
c41374	which the king of Judah hath read:
c41375	Because they have forsaken
c41376	me, and have burned incense unto other gods,
c41377	that they might provoke me to anger with all the works of their hands;
c41378	therefore my wrath shall be kindled against this place,
c41379	and shall not be quenched.
c41380	But to the king of Judah
c41381	which sent
c41382	you to enquire of the LORD,
c41383	thus shall ye say to
c41384	him, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel,
c41385	<i>As touching</i> the words
c41386	which thou hast heard;
c41387	Because thine heart was tender,
c41388	and thou hast humbled thyself before the LORD,
c41389	when thou heardest
c41390	what I spake against this place, and against the inhabitants
c41391	thereof, that they should become a desolation and a curse,
c41392	and hast rent thy clothes,
c41393	and wept before
c41394	me; I also have heard
c41395	<i>thee,</i> saith the LORD.
c41397	Behold therefore, I will gather thee unto thy fathers,
c41398	and thou shalt be gathered into thy grave in peace;
c41399	and thine eyes shall not see all the evil
c41400	which I will bring upon this place.
c41401	And they brought the king word again.
c41402	And the king sent,
c41403	and they gathered unto him all the elders of Judah and of Jerusalem.
c41404	And the king went up into the house of the LORD,
c41405	and all the men of Judah and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem with
c41406	him, and the priests, and the prophets, and all the people, both small and great:
c41407	and he read in their ears all the words of the book of the covenant
c41408	which was found in the house of the LORD.
c41409	And the king stood by a pillar,
c41410	and made a covenant before the LORD,
c41411	to walk after the LORD,
c41412	and to keep his commandments and his testimonies and his statutes with all <i>their</i> heart and all <i>their</i> soul,
c41413	to perform the words of this covenant
c41414	that were written in this book.
c41415	And all the people stood to the covenant.
c41416	And the king commanded Hilkiah the high priest, and the priests of the second order, and the keepers of the door,
c41417	to bring forth out of the temple of the LORD all the vessels
c41418	that were made for Baal, and for the grove, and for all the host of heaven:
c41419	and he burned them without Jerusalem in the fields of Kidron,
c41420	and carried the ashes of them unto Bethel.
c41421	And he put down the idolatrous priests,
c41422	whom the kings of Judah had ordained
c41423	to burn incense in the high places in the cities of Judah, and in the places round about Jerusalem;
c41424	them also that burned incense unto Baal, to the sun, and to the moon, and to the planets, and to all the host of heaven.
c41425	And he brought out the grove from the house of the LORD, without Jerusalem, unto the brook Kidron,
c41426	and burned it at the brook Kidron,
c41427	and stamped <i>it</i> small to powder,
c41428	and cast the powder thereof upon the graves of the children of the people.
c41429	And he brake down the houses of the sodomites,
c41430	that <i>were</i> by the house of the LORD,
c41431	where the women wove hangings for the grove.
c41432	And he brought all the priests out of the cities of Judah,
c41433	and defiled the high places
c41434	where the priests had burned incense,
c41435	from Geba to Beersheba,
c41436	and brake down the high places of the gates
c41437	that <i>were</i> in the entering in of the gate of Joshua the governor of the city,
c41438	which <i>were</i> on a man's left hand at the gate of the city.
c41439	Nevertheless the priests of the high places came not up to the altar of the LORD in Jerusalem,
c41440	but they did eat of the unleavened bread among their brethren.
c41441	And he defiled Topheth,
c41442	which <i>is</i> in the valley of the children of Hinnom,
c41443	that no man might make his son or his daughter to pass through the fire to Molech.
c41444	And he took away the horses
c41445	that the kings of Judah had given to the sun,
c41446	at the entering in of the house of the LORD,
c41447	by the chamber of Nathanmelech the chamberlain,
c41448	which <i>was</i> in the suburbs,
c41449	and burned the chariots of the sun with fire.
c41450	And the altars
c41451	that <i>were</i> on the top of the upper chamber of Ahaz,
c41452	which the kings of Judah had made,
c41453	and the altars
c41454	which Manasseh had made in the two courts of the house of the LORD,
c41455	did the king beat down,
c41456	and brake <i>them</i> down from thence,
c41457	and cast the dust of them into the brook Kidron.
c41458	And the high places
c41459	that <i>were</i> before Jerusalem,
c41460	which <i>were</i> on the right hand of the mount of corruption,
c41461	which Solomon the king of Israel had builded for Ashtoreth the abomination of the Zidonians, and for Chemosh the abomination of the Moabites, and for Milcom the abomination of the children of Ammon,
c41462	did the king defile.
c41463	And he brake in pieces the images,
c41464	and cut down the groves,
c41465	and filled their places with the bones of men.
c41466	Moreover the altar
c41467	that <i>was</i> at Bethel,
c41468	<i>and</i> the high place
c41469	which Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin, had made,
c41471	both that altar and the high place he brake down,
c41472	and burned the high place,
c41473	<i>and</i> stamped <i>it</i> small to powder,
c41474	and burned the grove.
c41475	And as Josiah turned
c41476	himself, he spied the sepulchres
c41477	that <i>were</i> there in the mount,
c41478	and sent,
c41479	and took the bones out of the sepulchres,
c41480	and burned <i>them</i> upon the altar,
c41481	and polluted
c41482	it, according to the word of the LORD
c41483	which the man of God proclaimed,
c41484	who proclaimed these words.
c41485	Then he said,
c41486	What title <i>is</i> that
c41487	that I see?
c41488	And the men of the city told
c41489	him, <i>It is</i> the sepulchre of the man of God,
c41490	which came from Judah,
c41491	and proclaimed these things
c41492	that thou hast done
c41493	against the altar of Bethel.
c41494	And he said,
c41495	Let him alone;
c41496	let no man move his bones.
c41497	So they let his bones alone, with the bones of the prophet
c41498	that came out of Samaria.
c41499	And all the houses also of the high places
c41500	that <i>were</i> in the cities of Samaria,
c41501	which the kings of Israel had made
c41502	to provoke <i>the LORD</i> to anger,
c41503	Josiah took away,
c41504	and did to them according to all the acts
c41505	that he had done in Bethel.
c41506	And he slew all the priests of the high places
c41507	that <i>were</i> there
c41508	upon the altars,
c41509	and burned men's bones upon
c41510	them, and returned to Jerusalem.
c41511	And the king commanded all the people,
c41512	saying,
c41513	Keep the passover unto the LORD your God,
c41514	as <i>it is</i> written in the book of this covenant.
c41515	Surely there was not holden such a passover from the days of the judges
c41516	that judged Israel,
c41517	nor in all the days of the kings of Israel, nor of the kings of Judah;
c41518	But in the eighteenth year of king Josiah, <i>wherein</i> this passover was holden to the LORD in Jerusalem.
c41519	Moreover the <i>workers with</i> familiar spirits, and the wizards, and the images, and the idols, and all the abominations
c41520	that were spied in the land of Judah and in Jerusalem,
c41521	did Josiah put away,
c41522	that he might perform the words of the law
c41523	which were written in the book
c41524	that Hilkiah the priest found in the house of the LORD.
c41525	And like unto him was there no king before
c41526	him, that turned to the LORD with all his heart, and with all his soul, and with all his might, according to all the law of Moses;
c41527	neither after him arose there <i>any</i> like him.
c41528	Notwithstanding the LORD turned not from the fierceness of his great wrath,
c41529	wherewith his anger was kindled against Judah,
c41530	because of all the provocations
c41531	that Manasseh had provoked him withal.
c41532	And the LORD said,
c41533	I will remove Judah also out of my sight,
c41534	as I have removed Israel,
c41535	and will cast off this city
c41537	Jerusalem which I have chosen, and the house
c41538	of which I said,
c41539	My name shall be there.
c41540	Now the rest of the acts of Josiah, and all
c41541	that he did,
c41542	<i>are</i> they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
c41543	In his days Pharaohnechoh king of Egypt went up against the king of Assyria to the river Euphrates:
c41544	and king Josiah went
c41545	against
c41546	him; and he slew him at Megiddo,
c41547	when he had seen him.
c41548	And his servants carried him in a chariot dead from Megiddo,
c41549	and brought him to Jerusalem,
c41550	and buried him in his own sepulchre.
c41551	And the people of the land took Jehoahaz the son of Josiah,
c41552	and anointed
c41553	him, and made him king in his father's stead.
c41554	Jehoahaz <i>was</i> twenty and three years old
c41555	when he began to reign;
c41556	and he reigned three months in Jerusalem.
c41557	And his mother's name <i>was</i> Hamutal, the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah.
c41558	And he did <i>that which was</i> evil in the sight of the LORD, according to all
c41559	that his fathers had done.
c41560	And Pharaohnechoh put him in bands at Riblah in the land of Hamath,
c41561	that he might not reign in Jerusalem;
c41562	and put the land to a tribute of an hundred talents of silver, and a talent of gold.
c41563	And Pharaohnechoh made Eliakim the son of Josiah king in the room of Josiah his father,
c41564	and turned his name to Jehoiakim,
c41565	and took Jehoahaz
c41566	away: and he came to Egypt,
c41567	and died there.
c41568	And Jehoiakim gave the silver and the gold to Pharaoh;
c41569	but he taxed the land
c41570	to give the money according to the commandment of Pharaoh:
c41571	of every one according to his taxation,
c41572	he exacted the silver and the gold of the people of the land,
c41573	to give <i>it</i> unto Pharaohnechoh.
c41574	Jehoiakim <i>was</i> twenty and five years old
c41575	when he began to reign;
c41576	and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem.
c41577	And his mother's name <i>was</i> Zebudah, the daughter of Pedaiah of Rumah.
c41578	And he did <i>that which was</i> evil in the sight of the LORD, according to all
c41579	that his fathers had done.
c41580	In his days Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up,
c41581	and Jehoiakim became his servant three years:
c41582	then he turned
c41583	and rebelled against him.
c41584	And the LORD sent against him bands of the Chaldees, and bands of the Syrians, and bands of the Moabites, and bands of the children of Ammon,
c41585	and sent them against Judah
c41586	to destroy
c41587	it, according to the word of the LORD,
c41588	which he spake by his servants the prophets.
c41589	Surely at the commandment of the LORD came <i>this</i> upon Judah,
c41590	to remove <i>them</i> out of his sight,
c41591	for the sins of Manasseh, according to all
c41592	that he did;
c41593	And also for the innocent blood
c41594	that he shed:
c41595	for he filled Jerusalem with innocent blood;
c41596	which the LORD would not
c41597	pardon.
c41598	Now the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim, and all
c41599	that he did,
c41600	<i>are</i> they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
c41601	So Jehoiakim slept with his fathers:
c41602	and Jehoiachin his son reigned in his stead.
c41603	And the king of Egypt came not again any more
c41604	out of his land:
c41605	for the king of Babylon had taken from the river of Egypt unto the river Euphrates all
c41606	that pertained to the king of Egypt.
c41607	Jehoiachin <i>was</i> eighteen years old
c41608	when he began to reign,
c41609	and he reigned in Jerusalem three months.
c41610	And his mother's name <i>was</i> Nehushta, the daughter of Elnathan of Jerusalem.
c41611	And he did <i>that which was</i> evil in the sight of the LORD, according to all
c41612	that his father had done.
c41613	At that time the servants of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up against Jerusalem,
c41614	and the city was besieged.
c41615	And Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came against the city,
c41616	and his servants did besiege it.
c41617	And Jehoiachin the king of Judah went out to the king of Babylon, he, and his mother, and his servants, and his princes, and his officers:
c41618	and the king of Babylon took him in the eighth year
c41619	of his reign.
c41620	And he carried out thence all the treasures of the house of the LORD, and the treasures of the king's house,
c41621	and cut in pieces all the vessels of gold
c41622	which Solomon king of Israel had made in the temple of the LORD,
c41623	as the LORD had said.
c41624	And he carried away all Jerusalem, and all the princes, and all the mighty men of valour, <i>even</i> ten thousand captives, and all the craftsmen and smiths:
c41625	none remained, save the poorest sort of the people of the land.
c41626	And he carried away Jehoiachin to Babylon,
c41627	and the king's mother, and the king's wives, and his officers, and the mighty of the land, <i>those</i> carried he into captivity from Jerusalem to Babylon.
c41628	And all the men of might, <i>even</i> seven thousand, and craftsmen and smiths a thousand,
c41629	all <i>that were</i> strong <i>and</i> apt for war,
c41630	even them the king of Babylon brought captive to Babylon.
c41631	And the king of Babylon made Mattaniah his father's brother king in his stead,
c41632	and changed his name to Zedekiah.
c41633	Zedekiah <i>was</i> twenty and one years old
c41634	when he began to reign,
c41635	and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem.
c41636	And his mother's name <i>was</i> Hamutal, the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah.
c41637	And he did <i>that which was</i> evil in the sight of the LORD, according to all
c41638	that Jehoiakim had done.
c41639	For through the anger of the LORD it came to pass in Jerusalem and Judah,
c41640	until he had cast them out from his presence,
c41641	that Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon.
c41642	And it came to pass in the ninth year
c41643	of his reign,
c41644	in the tenth month, in the tenth <i>day</i> of the month, <i>that</i> Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came, he, and all his host, against Jerusalem,
c41645	and pitched against
c41646	it; and they built forts against it round about.
c41647	And the city was besieged unto the eleventh year of king Zedekiah.
c41648	And on the ninth <i>day</i> of the <i>fourth</i> month
c41649	the famine prevailed in the city,
c41650	and there was no bread for the people of the land.
c41651	And the city was broken up,
c41652	and all the men of war <i>fled</i> by night by the way of the gate between two walls,
c41653	which <i>is</i> by the king's garden:
c41654	(now the Chaldees <i>were</i> against the city round about:)
c41655	and <i>the king</i> went the way toward the plain.
c41656	And the army of the Chaldees pursued after the king,
c41657	and overtook him in the plains of Jericho:
c41658	and all his army were scattered from him.
c41659	So they took the king,
c41660	and brought him up to the king of Babylon to Riblah;
c41661	and they gave judgment upon him.
c41662	And they slew the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes,
c41663	and put out the eyes of Zedekiah,
c41664	and bound him with fetters of brass,
c41665	and carried him to Babylon.
c41666	And in the fifth month, on the seventh <i>day</i> of the month,
c41667	which <i>is</i> the nineteenth year of king Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon,
c41668	came Nebuzaradan, captain of the guard, a servant of the king of Babylon, unto Jerusalem:
c41669	And he burnt the house of the LORD, and the king's house,
c41670	and all the houses of Jerusalem, and every great <i>man's</i> house burnt he with fire.
c41671	And all the army of the Chaldees, that <i>were with</i> the captain of the guard, brake down the walls of Jerusalem round about.
c41673	Now the rest of the people
c41674	<i>that were</i> left in the city,
c41675	and the fugitives
c41676	that fell away to the king of Babylon,
c41677	with the remnant of the multitude, did Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carry away.
c41678	But the captain of the guard left of the poor of the land <i>to be</i> vinedressers and husbandmen.
c41679	And the pillars of brass
c41680	that <i>were</i> in the house of the LORD,
c41681	and the bases, and the brasen sea
c41682	that <i>was</i> in the house of the LORD,
c41683	did the Chaldees break in pieces,
c41684	and carried the brass of them to Babylon.
c41685	And the pots, and the shovels, and the snuffers, and the spoons, and all the vessels of brass
c41686	wherewith they ministered,
c41687	took they away.
c41688	And the firepans, and the bowls,
c41689	<i>and</i> such things as <i>were</i> of gold, <i>in</i> gold,
c41690	and of silver, <i>in</i> silver,
c41691	the captain of the guard took away.
c41692	The two pillars, one sea, and the bases
c41693	which Solomon had made for the house of the LORD;
c41694	the brass of all these vessels was without weight.
c41695	The height of the one pillar <i>was</i> eighteen cubits,
c41696	and the chapiter upon it <i>was</i> brass:
c41697	and the height of the chapiter three cubits;
c41698	and the wreathen work, and pomegranates upon the chapiter round about,
c41699	all of brass:
c41700	and like unto these had the second pillar with wreathen work.
c41701	And the captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest, and Zephaniah the second priest, and the three keepers of the door:
c41702	And out of the city he took an officer
c41703	that was set over the men of war, and five men
c41704	of them that were in the king's presence, which were found in the city,
c41706	and the principal scribe of the host,
c41707	which mustered the people of the land,
c41708	and threescore men of the people of the land
c41709	<i>that were</i> found in the city:
c41710	And Nebuzaradan captain of the guard took
c41711	these, and brought them to the king of Babylon to Riblah:
c41712	And the king of Babylon smote
c41713	them, and slew them at Riblah in the land of Hamath.
c41714	So Judah was carried away out of their land.
c41715	And <i>as for</i> the people
c41716	that remained in the land of Judah,
c41717	whom Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had left,
c41718	even over them he made Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, ruler.
c41719	And when all the captains of the armies, they and their men, heard
c41720	that the king of Babylon had made Gedaliah governor,
c41721	there came to Gedaliah to Mizpah,
c41722	even Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and Johanan the son of Careah, and Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth the Netophathite, and Jaazaniah the son of a Maachathite, they and their men.
c41723	And Gedaliah sware to them, and to their men,
c41724	and said
c41725	unto them, Fear not to be the servants of the Chaldees:
c41726	dwell in the land,
c41727	and serve the king of Babylon;
c41728	and it shall be well with you.
c41729	But it came to pass in the seventh month,
c41730	that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, the son of Elishama, of the seed royal, came,
c41731	and ten men with
c41732	him, and smote Gedaliah,
c41733	that he died,
c41734	and the Jews and the Chaldees
c41735	that were with him at Mizpah.
c41736	And all the people, both small and great, and the captains of the armies, arose,
c41737	and came to Egypt:
c41738	for they were afraid of the Chaldees.
c41739	And it came to pass in the seven and thirtieth year of the captivity of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the twelfth month, on the seven and twentieth <i>day</i> of the month,
c41740	<i>that</i> Evilmerodach king of Babylon in the year that he began to reign did lift up
c41742	the head of Jehoiachin king of Judah out of prison;
c41743	And he spake kindly to
c41744	him, and set his throne above the throne of the kings
c41745	that <i>were</i> with him in Babylon;
c41746	And changed his prison garments:
c41747	and he did eat bread continually before him all the days of his life.
c41748	And his allowance
c41749	<i>was</i> a continual allowance given him of the king, a daily rate for every day, all the days of his life.
c41750	The vision of Isaiah the son of Amoz,
c41751	which he saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, <i>and</i> Hezekiah, kings of Judah.
c41752	Hear,
c41753	O heavens,
c41754	and give ear,
c41755	O earth:
c41756	for the LORD hath spoken,
c41757	I have nourished and brought up children,
c41759	and they have rebelled against me.
c41760	The ox knoweth his owner,
c41761	and the ass his master's crib:
c41762	<i>but</i> Israel doth not know,
c41763	my people doth not consider.
c41764	Ah sinful nation, a people laden with iniquity, a seed of evildoers, children that are corrupters:
c41765	they have forsaken the LORD,
c41766	they have provoked the Holy One of Israel
c41767	unto anger, they are gone away backward.
c41768	Why should ye be stricken any more?
c41769	ye will revolt more and more:
c41770	the whole head is sick,
c41771	and the whole heart faint.
c41772	From the sole of the foot even unto the head <i>there is</i> no soundness
c41773	in it; <i>but</i> wounds, and bruises, and putrifying sores:
c41774	they have not been closed,
c41775	neither bound up,
c41776	neither mollified with ointment.
c41777	Your country <i>is</i> desolate,
c41778	your cities <i>are</i> burned with fire:
c41779	your land,
c41780	strangers devour it in your presence,
c41781	and <i>it is</i> desolate, as overthrown by strangers.
c41782	And the daughter of Zion is left as a cottage in a vineyard, as a lodge in a garden of cucumbers, as a besieged city.
c41783	Except the LORD of hosts had left unto us a very small remnant,
c41784	we should have been as Sodom,
c41785	<i>and</i> we should have been like unto Gomorrah.
c41786	Hear the word of the LORD,
c41787	ye rulers of Sodom;
c41788	give ear unto the law of our God,
c41789	ye people of Gomorrah.
c41790	To what purpose <i>is</i> the multitude of your sacrifices
c41791	unto me? saith the LORD:
c41792	I am full of the burnt offerings of rams, and the fat of fed beasts;
c41793	and I delight not in the blood of bullocks, or of lambs, or of he goats.
c41794	When ye come
c41795	to appear before
c41796	me, who hath required this at your hand,
c41797	to tread my courts?
c41799	Bring no more vain oblations;
c41800	incense is an abomination
c41801	unto me; the new moons and sabbaths,
c41802	the calling of assemblies,
c41803	I cannot away with; <i>it is</i> iniquity, even the solemn meeting.
c41804	Your new moons and your appointed feasts my soul hateth:
c41805	they are a trouble unto me;
c41806	I am weary
c41807	to bear <i>them.</i>
c41809	And when ye spread forth your hands,
c41810	I will hide mine eyes from
c41811	you: yea, when ye make many prayers,
c41812	I will not hear:
c41813	your hands are full of blood.
c41814	Wash
c41815	you, make you clean;
c41816	put away the evil of your doings from before mine eyes;
c41817	cease
c41818	to do evil;
c41819	Learn
c41820	to do well;
c41821	seek judgment,
c41822	relieve the oppressed,
c41823	judge the fatherless,
c41824	plead for the widow.
c41825	Come now,
c41826	and let us reason together,
c41827	saith the LORD:
c41828	though your sins be as scarlet,
c41829	they shall be as white as snow;
c41830	though they be red like crimson,
c41831	they shall be as wool.
c41832	If ye be willing
c41833	and obedient,
c41834	ye shall eat the good of the land:
c41835	But if ye refuse
c41836	and rebel,
c41837	ye shall be devoured with the sword:
c41838	for the mouth of the LORD hath spoken <i>it.</i>
c41839	How is the faithful city become an harlot!
c41840	it was full of judgment;
c41841	righteousness lodged
c41842	in it; but now murderers.
c41843	Thy silver is become dross,
c41844	thy wine mixed with water:
c41845	Thy princes <i>are</i> rebellious, and companions of thieves:
c41846	every one loveth gifts,
c41847	and followeth after rewards:
c41848	they judge not the fatherless,
c41849	neither doth the cause of the widow come unto them.
c41850	Therefore saith the Lord, the LORD of hosts, the mighty One of Israel,
c41851	Ah, I will ease me of mine adversaries,
c41852	and avenge me of mine enemies:
c41853	And I will turn my hand upon
c41854	thee, and purely purge away thy dross,
c41855	and take away all thy tin:
c41856	And I will restore thy judges as at the first,
c41857	and thy counsellors as at the beginning:
c41858	afterward thou shalt be called,
c41859	The city of righteousness, the faithful city.
c41860	Zion shall be redeemed with judgment,
c41861	and her converts with righteousness.
c41862	And the destruction of the transgressors and of the sinners <i>shall be</i> together,
c41863	and they that forsake the LORD shall be consumed.
c41864	For they shall be ashamed of the oaks
c41865	which ye have desired,
c41866	and ye shall be confounded for the gardens
c41867	that ye have chosen.
c41868	For ye shall be as an oak whose leaf fadeth,
c41869	and as a garden
c41870	that hath no water.
c41871	And the strong shall be as tow,
c41872	and the maker of it as a spark,
c41873	and they shall both burn together,
c41874	and none shall quench <i>them.</i>
c41875	The word
c41876	that Isaiah the son of Amoz saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem.
c41877	And it shall come to pass in the last days,
c41878	<i>that</i> the mountain of the LORD'S house shall be established in the top of the mountains,
c41879	and shall be exalted above the hills;
c41880	and all nations shall flow unto it.
c41881	And many people shall go
c41882	and say,
c41883	Come
c41884	ye, and let us go up to the mountain of the LORD, to the house of the God of Jacob;
c41885	and he will teach us of his ways,
c41886	and we will walk in his paths:
c41887	for out of Zion shall go forth the law,
c41888	and the word of the LORD from Jerusalem.
c41889	And he shall judge among the nations,
c41890	and shall rebuke many people:
c41891	and they shall beat their swords into plowshares,
c41892	and their spears into pruninghooks:
c41893	nation shall not lift up sword against nation,
c41894	neither shall they learn war any more.
c41895	O house of Jacob,
c41896	come
c41897	ye, and let us walk in the light of the LORD.
c41898	Therefore thou hast forsaken thy people the house of Jacob,
c41899	because they be replenished from the east,
c41900	and <i>are</i> soothsayers like the Philistines,
c41901	and they please themselves in the children of strangers.
c41902	Their land also is full of silver and gold,
c41903	neither <i>is there any</i> end of their treasures;
c41904	their land is also full of horses,
c41905	neither <i>is there any</i> end of their chariots:
c41906	Their land also is full of idols;
c41907	they worship the work of their own hands,
c41908	that which their own fingers have made:
c41909	And the mean man boweth down,
c41910	and the great man humbleth
c41911	himself: therefore forgive them not.
c41912	Enter into the rock,
c41913	and hide thee in the dust, for fear of the LORD, and for the glory of his majesty.
c41914	The lofty looks of man shall be humbled,
c41915	and the haughtiness of men shall be bowed down,
c41916	and the LORD alone shall be exalted in that day.
c41917	For the day of the LORD of hosts <i>shall be</i> upon every <i>one that is</i> proud and lofty,
c41918	and upon every <i>one that is</i> lifted up; and he shall be brought low:
c41919	And upon all the cedars of Lebanon, <i>that are</i> high and lifted up,
c41920	and upon all the oaks of Bashan,
c41921	And upon all the high mountains,
c41922	and upon all the hills <i>that are</i> lifted up,
c41923	And upon every high tower,
c41924	and upon every fenced wall,
c41925	And upon all the ships of Tarshish,
c41926	and upon all pleasant pictures.
c41927	And the loftiness of man shall be bowed down,
c41928	and the haughtiness of men shall be made low:
c41929	and the LORD alone shall be exalted in that day.
c41930	And the idols he shall utterly abolish.
c41931	And they shall go into the holes of the rocks, and into the caves of the earth, for fear of the LORD, and for the glory of his majesty,
c41932	when he ariseth
c41933	to shake terribly the earth.
c41934	In that day a man shall cast his idols of silver, and his idols of gold,
c41935	which they made
c41936	<i>each one</i> for himself to worship,
c41937	to the moles
c41938	and to the bats;
c41939	To go into the clefts of the rocks, and into the tops of the ragged rocks, for fear of the LORD, and for the glory of his majesty,
c41940	when he ariseth
c41941	to shake terribly the earth.
c41942	Cease ye from man,
c41943	whose breath <i>is</i> in his nostrils:
c41944	for wherein is he to be accounted of?
c41945	For, behold, the Lord, the LORD of hosts, doth take away from Jerusalem and from Judah the stay and the staff, the whole stay of bread, and the whole stay of water,
c41946	The mighty man, and the man of war, the judge, and the prophet, and the prudent, and the ancient,
c41947	The captain of fifty, and the honourable man, and the counsellor, and the cunning artificer, and the eloquent orator.
c41948	And I will give children <i>to be</i> their princes,
c41949	and babes shall rule over them.
c41950	And the people shall be oppressed,
c41951	every one by another,
c41952	and every one by his neighbour:
c41953	the child shall behave himself proudly against the ancient,
c41954	and the base against the honourable.
c41955	When a man shall take hold of his brother of the house of his father,
c41956	<i>saying,</i> Thou hast clothing,
c41957	be thou our ruler,
c41958	and <i>let</i> this ruin <i>be</i> under thy hand:
c41959	In that day shall he swear,
c41960	saying,
c41961	I will not be an healer;
c41962	for in my house <i>is</i> neither bread
c41963	nor clothing:
c41964	make me not a ruler of the people.
c41965	For Jerusalem is ruined,
c41966	and Judah is fallen:
c41967	because their tongue and their doings <i>are</i> against the LORD,
c41968	to provoke the eyes of his glory.
c41969	The shew of their countenance doth witness
c41970	against them; and they declare their sin as Sodom,
c41971	they hide <i>it</i> not.
c41972	Woe unto their soul!
c41973	for they have rewarded evil unto themselves.
c41974	Say ye to the righteous,
c41975	that <i>it shall be</i> well
c41976	<i>with him:</i> for they shall eat the fruit of their doings.
c41977	Woe unto the wicked!
c41978	<i>it shall be</i> ill
c41979	<i>with him:</i> for the reward of his hands shall be given him.
c41980	<i>As for</i> my people,
c41981	children <i>are</i> their oppressors,
c41982	and women rule
c41983	over them. O my people,
c41984	they which lead thee cause <i>thee</i> to err,
c41985	and destroy the way of thy paths.
c41986	standeth up
c41987	to plead,
c41988	The LORD
c41989	and standeth
c41990	to judge the people.
c41991	The LORD will enter into judgment with the ancients of his people, and the princes
c41992	thereof: for ye have eaten up the vineyard;
c41993	the spoil of the poor <i>is</i> in your houses.
c41994	What mean ye
c41995	<i>that</i> ye beat my people to pieces,
c41996	and grind the faces of the poor?
c41997	saith the Lord GOD of hosts.
c41998	Moreover the LORD saith,
c41999	Because the daughters of Zion are haughty,
c42000	and walk with stretched forth necks and wanton eyes,
c42001	walking and mincing <i>as</i> they go,
c42002	and making a tinkling with their feet:
c42003	Therefore the Lord will smite with a scab the crown of the head of the daughters of Zion,
c42004	and the LORD will discover their secret parts.
c42005	In that day the Lord will take away the bravery of <i>their</i> tinkling ornaments <i>about their feet,</i> and <i>their</i> cauls, and <i>their</i> round tires like the moon,
c42006	The chains, and the bracelets, and the mufflers,
c42007	The bonnets, and the ornaments of the legs, and the headbands, and the tablets, and the earrings,
c42008	The rings, and nose jewels,
c42009	The changeable suits of apparel, and the mantles, and the wimples, and the crisping pins,
c42010	The glasses, and the fine linen, and the hoods, and the vails.
c42011	And it shall come to pass,
c42012	<i>that</i> instead of sweet smell there shall be stink;
c42013	and instead of a girdle a rent;
c42014	and instead of well set hair baldness;
c42015	and instead of a stomacher a girding of sackcloth;
c42016	<i>and</i> burning instead of beauty.
c42017	Thy men shall fall by the sword,
c42018	and thy mighty in the war.
c42020	And her gates shall lament and mourn;
c42021	and she <i>being</i> desolate
c42022	shall sit upon the ground.
c42023	And in that day seven women shall take hold of one man,
c42024	saying,
c42025	We will eat our own bread,
c42026	and wear our own apparel:
c42027	only let us be called by thy name,
c42028	to take away our reproach.
c42029	In that day shall the branch of the LORD be beautiful and glorious,
c42030	and the fruit of the earth <i>shall be</i> excellent and comely for them that are escaped of Israel.
c42031	And it shall come to pass,
c42032	<i>that he that is</i> left in Zion,
c42033	and <i>he that</i> remaineth in Jerusalem,
c42035	shall be called holy, <i>even</i> every one
c42036	that is written among the living in Jerusalem:
c42037	When the Lord shall have washed away the filth of the daughters of Zion,
c42038	and shall have purged the blood of Jerusalem from the midst thereof by the spirit of judgment, and by the spirit
c42039	of burning.
c42040	And the LORD will create upon every dwelling place of mount Zion, and upon her assemblies, a cloud and smoke by day,
c42041	and the shining of a flaming fire by night:
c42042	for upon all the glory <i>shall be</i> a defence.
c42043	And there shall be a tabernacle for a shadow in the daytime from the heat,
c42044	and for a place of refuge, and for a covert from storm and from rain.
c42045	Now will I sing to my wellbeloved a song of my beloved touching his vineyard.
c42046	My wellbeloved hath a vineyard in a very fruitful hill:
c42047	And he fenced
c42048	it, and gathered out the stones
c42049	thereof, and planted it with the choicest vine,
c42050	and built a tower in the midst
c42051	of it, and also made a winepress
c42052	therein: and he looked
c42053	that it should bring forth grapes,
c42054	and it brought forth wild grapes.
c42055	And now,
c42056	O inhabitants of Jerusalem, and men of Judah,
c42057	judge, I pray you, betwixt me and my vineyard.
c42058	What
c42059	could have been done more to my vineyard,
c42060	that I have not done
c42061	in it? wherefore, when I looked
c42062	that it should bring forth grapes,
c42063	brought it forth wild grapes?
c42064	And now go to; I will tell
c42065	you what I will do to my vineyard:
c42066	I will take away the hedge
c42067	thereof, and it shall be
c42068	eaten up;
c42069	<i>and</i> break down the wall
c42070	thereof, and it shall be trodden down:
c42071	And I will lay it waste:
c42072	it shall not be pruned,
c42073	nor digged;
c42074	but there shall come up briers and thorns:
c42075	I will also command the clouds
c42076	that they rain no rain upon it.
c42077	For the vineyard of the LORD of hosts <i>is</i> the house of Israel,
c42078	and the men of Judah his pleasant plant:
c42079	and he looked for judgment,
c42080	but behold oppression;
c42081	for righteousness,
c42082	but behold a cry.
c42083	Woe
c42084	unto them that join house to house,
c42085	<i>that</i> lay field to field, till <i>there be</i> no place,
c42086	that they may be placed alone in the midst of the earth!
c42087	In mine ears <i>said</i> the LORD of hosts,
c42088	Of a truth many houses shall be desolate,
c42089	<i>even</i> great and fair, without inhabitant.
c42090	Yea, ten acres of vineyard shall yield one bath,
c42091	and the seed of an homer shall yield an ephah.
c42092	Woe
c42093	unto them that rise up early in the morning,
c42094	<i>that</i> they may follow strong drink;
c42095	that continue until night,
c42096	<i>till</i> wine inflame them!
c42097	And the harp, and the viol, the tabret, and pipe, and wine, are in their feasts:
c42098	but they regard not the work of the LORD,
c42099	neither consider the operation of his hands.
c42100	Therefore my people are gone into captivity, because <i>they have</i> no knowledge:
c42101	and their honourable men <i>are</i> famished,
c42102	and their multitude dried up with thirst.
c42103	Therefore hell hath enlarged herself,
c42104	and opened her mouth without measure:
c42105	and their glory, and their multitude, and their pomp, and he that rejoiceth, shall descend into it.
c42106	And the mean man shall be brought down,
c42107	and the mighty man shall be humbled,
c42108	and the eyes of the lofty shall be humbled:
c42109	But the LORD of hosts shall be exalted in judgment,
c42110	and God that is holy shall be sanctified in righteousness.
c42111	Then shall the lambs feed after their manner,
c42112	and the waste places of the fat ones shall strangers eat.
c42113	Woe
c42114	unto them that draw iniquity with cords of vanity,
c42115	and sin as it were with a cart rope:
c42116	That say,
c42117	Let him make speed,
c42118	<i>and</i> hasten his work,
c42119	that we may see
c42121	<i>it:</i> and let the counsel of the Holy One of Israel draw nigh and come,
c42122	that we may know <i>it!</i>
c42123	Woe
c42124	unto them that call evil
c42125	good,
c42126	and good
c42127	evil;
c42128	that put darkness for light,
c42129	and light for darkness;
c42130	that put bitter for sweet,
c42131	and sweet for bitter!
c42132	Woe
c42133	unto <i>them that are</i> wise in their own eyes,
c42134	and prudent in their own sight!
c42135	Woe unto <i>them that are</i> mighty
c42136	to drink wine,
c42137	and men of strength
c42138	to mingle strong drink:
c42139	Which justify the wicked for reward,
c42140	and take away the righteousness of the righteous from him!
c42141	Therefore
c42142	as the fire devoureth the stubble,
c42143	and the flame consumeth the chaff,
c42144	<i>so</i> their root shall be as rottenness,
c42145	and their blossom shall go up as dust:
c42146	because they have cast away the law of the LORD of hosts,
c42147	and despised the word of the Holy One of Israel.
c42148	Therefore is the anger of the LORD kindled against his people,
c42149	and he hath stretched forth his hand against
c42150	them, and hath smitten
c42151	them: and the hills did tremble,
c42152	and their carcases <i>were</i> torn in the midst of the streets.
c42153	For all this his anger is not turned away,
c42154	but his hand <i>is</i> stretched out still.
c42155	And he will lift up an ensign to the nations from far,
c42156	and will hiss unto them from the end of the earth:
c42157	and, behold, they shall come with speed swiftly:
c42158	None shall be weary
c42159	nor stumble
c42160	among them; none shall slumber
c42161	nor sleep;
c42162	neither shall the girdle of their loins be loosed,
c42163	nor the latchet of their shoes be broken:
c42164	Whose arrows <i>are</i> sharp,
c42165	and all their bows bent,
c42166	their horses' hoofs shall be counted like flint,
c42167	and their wheels like a whirlwind:
c42168	Their roaring <i>shall be</i> like a lion,
c42169	they shall roar like young lions:
c42170	yea, they shall roar,
c42171	and lay hold of the prey,
c42172	and shall carry <i>it</i> away safe,
c42173	and none shall deliver <i>it.</i>
c42174	And in that day they shall roar against them like the roaring of the sea:
c42175	and if <i>one</i> look unto the land,
c42176	behold darkness <i>and</i> sorrow,
c42177	and the light is darkened in the heavens thereof.
c42178	In the year that king Uzziah died
c42179	I saw also the Lord
c42180	sitting upon a throne, high and lifted up,
c42181	and his train filled the temple.
c42182	Above it stood the seraphims:
c42183	each one had six wings;
c42184	with twain he covered his face,
c42185	and with twain he covered his feet,
c42186	and with twain he did fly.
c42187	And one cried unto another,
c42188	and said,
c42189	Holy, holy, holy, <i>is</i> the LORD of hosts:
c42190	the whole earth <i>is</i> full of his glory.
c42191	And the posts of the door moved at the voice of him that cried,
c42192	and the house was filled with smoke.
c42193	Then said
c42194	I, Woe
c42195	<i>is</i> me! for I am undone;
c42196	because I <i>am</i> a man of unclean lips,
c42197	and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips:
c42198	for mine eyes have seen the King, the LORD of hosts.
c42199	Then flew one of the seraphims unto
c42200	me, having a live coal in his hand,
c42201	<i>which</i> he had taken with the tongs from off the altar:
c42202	And he laid <i>it</i> upon my mouth,
c42203	and said,
c42204	Lo, this hath touched thy lips;
c42205	and thine iniquity is taken away,
c42206	and thy sin purged.
c42207	Also I heard the voice of the Lord,
c42208	saying,
c42209	Whom shall I send,
c42210	and who will go
c42211	for us? Then said
c42212	I, Here <i>am</i> I;
c42213	send me.
c42214	And he said,
c42215	Go,
c42216	and tell this people,
c42217	Hear ye indeed,
c42218	but understand not;
c42219	and see ye indeed,
c42220	but perceive not.
c42221	Make the heart of this people fat,
c42222	and make their ears heavy,
c42223	and shut their eyes;
c42224	lest they see with their eyes,
c42225	and hear with their ears,
c42226	and understand with their heart,
c42227	and convert,
c42228	and be healed.
c42229	Then said
c42230	how long?
c42231	I, Lord,
c42232	And he answered,
c42233	Until the cities be wasted
c42234	without inhabitant,
c42235	and the houses
c42236	without man,
c42237	and the land be utterly desolate,
c42238	And the LORD have removed men far away,
c42239	and <i>there be</i> a great forsaking in the midst of the land.
c42240	But yet in it <i>shall be</i> a tenth,
c42241	and <i>it</i> shall return,
c42242	and shall be
c42243	eaten:
c42244	as a teil tree, and as an oak,
c42245	whose substance <i>is</i> in them, when they cast
c42246	<i>their leaves: so</i> the holy seed <i>shall be</i> the substance thereof.
c42247	And it came to pass in the days of Ahaz the son of Jotham, the son of Uzziah, king of Judah,
c42248	<i>that</i> Rezin the king of Syria, and Pekah the son of Remaliah, king of Israel, went up toward Jerusalem to war against
c42249	it, but could not
c42250	prevail against it.
c42251	And it was told the house of David,
c42252	saying,
c42253	Syria is confederate with Ephraim.
c42254	And his heart was moved, and the heart of his people,
c42255	as the trees of the wood are moved with the wind.
c42256	Then said the LORD unto Isaiah,
c42257	Go forth now
c42258	to meet Ahaz,
c42259	thou, and Shearjashub thy son, at the end of the conduit of the upper pool in the highway of the fuller's field;
c42260	And say unto
c42261	him, Take heed,
c42262	and be quiet;
c42263	fear not,
c42264	neither be fainthearted for the two tails of these smoking firebrands, for the fierce anger of Rezin with Syria, and of the son of Remaliah.
c42265	Because Syria, Ephraim, and the son of Remaliah, have taken evil counsel against
c42266	thee, saying,
c42267	Let us go up against Judah,
c42268	and vex
c42269	it, and let us make a breach therein for
c42270	us, and set a king in the midst of it, <i>even</i> the son of Tabeal:
c42271	Thus saith the Lord GOD,
c42272	It shall not stand,
c42273	neither shall it come to pass.
c42274	For the head of Syria <i>is</i> Damascus,
c42275	and the head of Damascus <i>is</i> Rezin;
c42276	and within threescore and five years shall Ephraim be broken, that it be not a people.
c42277	And the head of Ephraim <i>is</i> Samaria,
c42278	and the head of Samaria <i>is</i> Remaliah's son.
c42279	If ye will not believe,
c42280	surely ye shall not be established.
c42281	Moreover the LORD spake again
c42282	unto Ahaz,
c42283	saying,
c42284	Ask thee a sign of the LORD thy God;
c42285	ask it either in the depth,
c42286	or in the height above.
c42287	But Ahaz said,
c42288	I will not ask,
c42289	neither will I tempt the LORD.
c42290	And he said,
c42291	Hear ye now,
c42292	O house of David;
c42293	<i>Is it</i> a small thing for
c42294	you to weary men,
c42295	but will ye weary my God also?
c42296	Therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign;
c42297	Behold, a virgin shall conceive,
c42298	and bear a son,
c42299	and shall call his name Immanuel.
c42300	Butter and honey shall he eat,
c42301	that he may know
c42302	to refuse the evil,
c42303	and choose the good.
c42304	For
c42305	before the child shall know
c42306	to refuse the evil,
c42307	and choose the good,
c42308	the land that thou abhorrest shall be forsaken
c42309	of both her kings.
c42310	The LORD shall bring upon thee, and upon thy people, and upon thy father's house, days
c42311	that have not come, from the day
c42312	that Ephraim departed from Judah;
c42313	<i>even</i> the king of Assyria.
c42314	And it shall come to pass in that day,
c42315	<i>that</i> the LORD shall hiss for the fly
c42316	that <i>is</i> in the uttermost part of the rivers of Egypt,
c42317	and for the bee
c42318	that <i>is</i> in the land of Assyria.
c42319	And they shall come,
c42320	and shall rest all of them in the desolate valleys, and in the holes of the rocks, and upon all thorns, and upon all bushes.
c42321	In the same day shall the Lord shave with a razor that is hired, <i>namely,</i> by them beyond the river, by the king of Assyria, the head, and the hair of the feet:
c42322	and it shall also consume the beard.
c42323	And it shall come to pass in that day,
c42324	<i>that</i> a man shall nourish a young cow, and two sheep;
c42325	And it shall come to pass, for the abundance
c42326	of milk <i>that</i> they shall give
c42327	he shall eat butter:
c42328	for butter and honey shall every one eat
c42329	that is left in the land.
c42330	And it shall come to pass in that day,
c42331	<i>that</i> every place shall be,
c42332	where there were a thousand vines at a thousand silverlings,
c42333	it shall <i>even</i> be for briers and thorns.
c42334	With arrows and with bows shall <i>men</i> come thither;
c42335	because all the land shall become briers and thorns.
c42336	And <i>on</i> all hills
c42337	that shall be digged with the mattock,
c42338	there shall not come thither the fear of briers and thorns:
c42339	but it shall be for the sending forth of oxen, and for the treading of lesser cattle.
c42340	Moreover the LORD said unto
c42341	me, Take thee a great roll,
c42342	and write in it with a man's pen
c42343	concerning Mahershalalhashbaz.
c42344	And I took unto me faithful witnesses to record, Uriah the priest, and Zechariah the son of Jeberechiah.
c42345	And I went unto the prophetess;
c42346	and she conceived,
c42347	and bare a son.
c42348	Then said the LORD to
c42349	me, Call his name Mahershalalhashbaz.
c42350	For
c42351	before the child shall have knowledge
c42352	to cry, My father, and my mother,
c42353	the riches of Damascus and the spoil of Samaria shall be taken away before the king of Assyria.
c42354	The LORD spake also unto me again,
c42356	saying,
c42357	Forasmuch as this people refuseth the waters of Shiloah
c42358	that go softly,
c42359	and rejoice in Rezin and Remaliah's son;
c42360	Now therefore, behold, the Lord bringeth up upon them the waters of the river, strong and many, <i>even</i> the king of Assyria, and all his glory:
c42361	and he shall come up over all his channels,
c42362	and go over all his banks:
c42363	And he shall pass through Judah;
c42364	he shall overflow
c42365	and go over,
c42366	he shall reach <i>even</i> to the neck;
c42367	and the stretching out of his wings shall fill the breadth of thy land,
c42368	O Immanuel.
c42369	Associate
c42370	yourselves, O ye people,
c42371	and ye shall be broken
c42372	in pieces; and give ear,
c42373	all ye of far countries:
c42374	gird yourselves,
c42375	and ye shall be broken
c42376	in pieces; gird yourselves,
c42377	and ye shall be broken in pieces.
c42378	Take counsel together,
c42379	and it shall come to nought;
c42380	speak the word,
c42381	and it shall not stand:
c42382	for God <i>is</i> with us.
c42383	For the LORD spake thus to me with a strong hand,
c42384	and instructed
c42385	me that I should not walk in the way of this people,
c42386	saying,
c42387	Say ye not, A confederacy, to all
c42388	<i>them to</i> whom this people shall say, A confederacy;
c42389	neither fear ye their fear,
c42390	nor be afraid.
c42391	the LORD of hosts
c42392	Sanctify
c42393	himself; and <i>let</i> him <i>be</i> your fear,
c42394	and <i>let</i> him <i>be</i> your dread.
c42395	And he shall be for a sanctuary;
c42396	but for a stone of stumbling and for a rock of offence to both the houses of Israel,
c42397	for a gin and for a snare to the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
c42398	And many among them shall stumble,
c42399	and fall,
c42400	and be broken,
c42401	and be snared,
c42402	and be taken.
c42403	Bind up the testimony,
c42404	seal the law among my disciples.
c42405	And I will wait upon the LORD,
c42406	that hideth his face from the house of Jacob,
c42407	and I will look for him.
c42408	Behold, I and the children
c42409	whom the LORD hath given
c42410	me <i>are</i> for signs and for wonders in Israel from the LORD of hosts,
c42411	which dwelleth in mount Zion.
c42412	And when they shall say unto
c42413	you, Seek unto them that have familiar spirits, and unto wizards
c42414	that peep,
c42415	and that mutter:
c42416	should not a people seek unto their God?
c42417	for the living to the dead?
c42418	To the law and to the testimony:
c42419	if they speak not according to this word,
c42420	<i>it is</i> because <i>there is</i> no light in them.
c42421	And they shall pass
c42422	through it, hardly bestead
c42423	and hungry:
c42424	and it shall come to pass,
c42425	that when they shall be hungry,
c42426	they shall fret themselves,
c42427	and curse their king and their God,
c42428	and look upward.
c42429	And they shall look unto the earth;
c42430	and behold trouble and darkness, dimness of anguish;
c42431	and <i>they shall be</i> driven to darkness.
c42432	Nevertheless the dimness <i>shall</i> not
c42433	<i>be</i> such as <i>was</i> in her vexation,
c42434	when at the first he lightly afflicted the land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali,
c42435	and afterward did more grievously afflict <i>her by</i> the way of the sea, beyond Jordan, in Galilee of the nations.
c42436	The people
c42437	that walked in darkness
c42438	have seen a great light:
c42439	they that dwell in the land of the shadow of death,
c42440	upon them hath the light shined.
c42441	Thou hast multiplied the nation,
c42442	<i>and</i> not increased the joy:
c42443	they joy before thee according to the joy in harvest,
c42444	<i>and</i> as <i>men</i> rejoice
c42445	when they divide the spoil.
c42446	For thou hast broken the yoke of his burden, and the staff of his shoulder, the rod
c42447	of his oppressor,
c42448	as in the day of Midian.
c42449	For every battle of the warrior <i>is</i> with confused noise,
c42450	and garments rolled in blood;
c42451	but <i>this</i> shall be with burning <i>and</i> fuel of fire.
c42452	For unto us a child is born,
c42453	unto us a son is given:
c42454	and the government shall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall be
c42455	called Wonderful, Counsellor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace.
c42456	Of the increase of <i>his</i> government and peace <i>there shall be</i> no end, upon the throne of David, and upon his kingdom,
c42457	to order
c42458	it, and to establish it with judgment and with justice from henceforth even for ever.
c42459	The zeal of the LORD of hosts will perform this.
c42460	The Lord sent a word into Jacob,
c42461	and it hath lighted upon Israel.
c42462	And all the people shall know, <i>even</i> Ephraim and the inhabitant of Samaria, that say in the pride and stoutness of heart,
c42464	The bricks are fallen down,
c42465	but we will build with hewn stones:
c42466	the sycomores are cut down,
c42467	but we will change <i>them into</i> cedars.
c42468	Therefore the LORD shall set up the adversaries of Rezin against
c42469	him, and join his enemies together;
c42470	The Syrians before,
c42471	and the Philistines behind;
c42472	and they shall devour Israel with open mouth.
c42473	For all this his anger is not turned away,
c42474	but his hand <i>is</i> stretched out still.
c42475	For the people turneth not
c42476	unto him that smiteth
c42477	them, neither do they seek the LORD of hosts.
c42478	Therefore the LORD will cut off from Israel head and tail, branch and rush, in one day.
c42479	The ancient and honourable,
c42480	he <i>is</i> the head;
c42481	and the prophet
c42482	that teacheth lies,
c42483	he <i>is</i> the tail.
c42484	For the leaders of this people cause <i>them</i> to err;
c42485	and <i>they that are</i> led of them <i>are</i> destroyed.
c42486	Therefore the Lord shall have no joy in their young men,
c42487	neither shall have mercy on their fatherless and widows:
c42488	for every one <i>is</i> an hypocrite and an evildoer,
c42489	and every mouth speaketh folly.
c42490	For all this his anger is not turned away,
c42491	but his hand <i>is</i> stretched out still.
c42492	For wickedness burneth as the fire:
c42493	it shall devour the briers and thorns,
c42494	and shall kindle in the thickets of the forest,
c42495	and they shall mount up <i>like</i> the lifting up of smoke.
c42496	Through the wrath of the LORD of hosts is the land darkened,
c42497	and the people shall be as the fuel of the fire:
c42498	man shall spare his brother.
c42499	no
c42500	And he shall snatch on the right hand,
c42501	and be hungry;
c42502	and he shall eat on the left hand,
c42503	and they shall not be satisfied:
c42504	every man the flesh of his own arm:
c42505	they shall eat
c42506	Manasseh, Ephraim;
c42507	and Ephraim, Manasseh:
c42508	<i>and</i> they together <i>shall be</i> against Judah.
c42509	For all this his anger is not turned away,
c42510	but his hand <i>is</i> stretched out still.
c42511	Woe
c42512	unto them that decree unrighteous decrees,
c42513	and that write grievousness
c42514	<i>which</i> they have prescribed;
c42515	To turn aside the needy from judgment,
c42516	and to take away the right from the poor of my people,
c42517	that widows may be their prey,
c42518	and <i>that</i> they may rob the fatherless!
c42519	And what will ye do in the day of visitation,
c42520	and in the desolation
c42521	<i>which</i> shall come from far?
c42522	to whom will ye flee for help?
c42523	and where will ye leave your glory?
c42524	Without me they shall bow down under the prisoners,
c42525	and they shall fall under the slain.
c42526	For all this his anger is not turned away,
c42527	but his hand <i>is</i> stretched out still.
c42528	O Assyrian, the rod of mine anger,
c42529	and the staff
c42530	in their hand is mine indignation.
c42531	I will send him against an hypocritical nation,
c42532	and against the people of my wrath will I give him a charge,
c42533	to take the spoil,
c42534	and to take the prey,
c42535	and to tread them down like the mire of the streets.
c42536	Howbeit he meaneth not so,
c42537	neither doth his heart think so;
c42538	but
c42539	to destroy
c42540	<i>it is</i> in his heart
c42541	and cut off nations
c42542	not a few.
c42543	For he saith,
c42544	<i>Are</i> not my princes altogether kings?
c42545	<i>Is</i> not Calno as Carchemish?
c42546	<i>is</i> not Hamath as Arpad?
c42547	<i>is</i> not Samaria as Damascus?
c42548	As my hand hath found the kingdoms of the idols,
c42549	and whose graven images did excel them of Jerusalem and of Samaria;
c42550	Shall I not,
c42551	as I have done unto Samaria and her idols,
c42552	so do to Jerusalem and her idols?
c42553	Wherefore it shall come to pass,
c42554	<i>that</i> when the Lord hath performed his whole work upon mount Zion and on Jerusalem,
c42555	I will punish the fruit of the stout heart of the king of Assyria, and the glory of his high looks.
c42556	For he saith,
c42557	By the strength of my hand I have done
c42558	<i>it,</i> and by my wisdom;
c42559	for I am prudent:
c42560	and I have removed the bounds of the people,
c42561	and have robbed their treasures,
c42562	and I have put down the inhabitants like a valiant <i>man:</i>
c42563	And my hand hath found as a nest the riches of the people:
c42565	and as one gathereth eggs <i>that are</i> left,
c42566	have I gathered all the earth;
c42567	and there was none
c42568	that moved the wing,
c42569	or opened the mouth,
c42570	or peeped.
c42571	Shall the axe boast itself
c42572	against him that heweth
c42573	therewith? <i>or</i> shall the saw magnify itself against him that shaketh
c42574	it? as if the rod should shake <i>itself</i> against
c42575	them that lift it up,
c42576	<i>or</i> as if the staff should lift up
c42577	<i>itself, as if it were</i> no wood.
c42578	Therefore shall the Lord, the Lord of hosts, send among his fat ones leanness;
c42579	and under his glory he shall kindle a burning like the burning of a fire.
c42580	And the light of Israel shall be for a fire,
c42581	and his Holy One for a flame:
c42582	and it shall burn
c42583	and devour his thorns and his briers in one day;
c42584	And shall consume the glory of his forest, and of his fruitful field, both soul and body:
c42585	and they shall be
c42586	as when a standardbearer fainteth.
c42587	And the rest of the trees of his forest shall be few,
c42588	that a child may write them.
c42589	And it shall come to pass in that day,
c42590	<i>that</i> the remnant of Israel, and such as are escaped of the house of Jacob, shall no more again
c42591	stay upon him that smote
c42592	them; but shall stay upon the LORD, the Holy One of Israel, in truth.
c42593	The remnant shall return, <i>even</i> the remnant of Jacob, unto the mighty God.
c42594	For
c42595	though thy people Israel be as the sand of the sea,
c42596	<i>yet</i> a remnant of them shall return:
c42597	the consumption decreed
c42598	shall overflow with righteousness.
c42599	For the Lord GOD of hosts shall make a consumption, even determined, in the midst of all the land.
c42600	Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD of hosts,
c42601	be not afraid
c42602	O my people
c42603	that dwellest in Zion,
c42604	of the Assyrian:
c42605	he shall smite thee with a rod,
c42606	and shall lift up his staff against thee, after the manner of Egypt.
c42607	For yet a very little
c42608	while, and the indignation shall cease,
c42609	and mine anger in their destruction.
c42610	And the LORD of hosts shall stir up a scourge for him according to the slaughter of Midian at the rock of Oreb:
c42611	and <i>as</i> his rod <i>was</i> upon the sea,
c42612	so shall he lift it up after the manner of Egypt.
c42613	And it shall come to pass in that day,
c42614	<i>that</i> his burden shall be taken away from off thy shoulder,
c42615	and his yoke from off thy neck,
c42616	and the yoke shall be destroyed because of the anointing.
c42617	He is come to Aiath,
c42618	he is passed to Migron;
c42619	at Michmash he hath laid up his carriages:
c42620	They are gone over the passage:
c42621	they have taken up their lodging at Geba;
c42622	Ramah is afraid;
c42623	Gibeah of Saul is fled.
c42624	Lift up thy voice,
c42625	O daughter of Gallim:
c42626	cause it to be heard
c42627	unto Laish,
c42628	O poor Anathoth.
c42629	Madmenah is removed;
c42630	the inhabitants of Gebim gather themselves to flee.
c42631	As yet shall he remain at Nob that day:
c42633	he shall shake his hand <i>against</i> the mount of the daughter of Zion, the hill of Jerusalem.
c42634	Behold, the Lord, the LORD of hosts, shall lop the bough with terror:
c42635	and the high ones of stature <i>shall be</i> hewn down,
c42636	and the haughty shall be humbled.
c42637	And he shall cut down the thickets of the forest with iron,
c42638	and Lebanon shall fall by a mighty one.
c42639	And there shall come forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse,
c42640	and a Branch shall grow out of his roots:
c42641	And the spirit of the LORD shall rest upon him, the spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel and might, the spirit of knowledge and of the fear of the LORD;
c42642	And shall make him of quick understanding in the fear of the LORD:
c42643	and he shall not judge after the sight of his eyes,
c42644	neither reprove after the hearing of his ears:
c42645	But with righteousness shall he judge the poor,
c42646	and reprove with equity for the meek of the earth:
c42647	and he shall smite the earth with the rod of his mouth,
c42648	and with the breath of his lips shall he slay the wicked.
c42649	And righteousness shall be the girdle of his loins,
c42650	and faithfulness the girdle of his reins.
c42651	The wolf also shall dwell with the lamb,
c42652	and the leopard shall lie down with the kid;
c42653	and the calf and the young lion and the fatling together;
c42654	and a little child shall lead them.
c42655	And the cow and the bear shall feed; their young ones shall lie down together:
c42657	and the lion shall eat straw like the ox.
c42658	And the sucking child shall play on the hole of the asp,
c42659	and the weaned child shall put his hand on the cockatrice' den.
c42660	They shall not hurt
c42661	nor destroy in all my holy mountain:
c42662	for the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the LORD,
c42663	as the waters cover the sea.
c42664	And in that day there shall be
c42665	a root of Jesse,
c42666	which shall stand for an ensign of the people;
c42667	to it shall the Gentiles seek:
c42668	and his rest shall be glorious.
c42669	And it shall come to pass in that day,
c42670	<i>that</i> the Lord shall set his hand again the second time
c42671	to recover the remnant of his people,
c42672	which shall be left, from Assyria, and from Egypt, and from Pathros, and from Cush, and from Elam, and from Shinar, and from Hamath, and from the islands of the sea.
c42673	And he shall set up an ensign for the nations,
c42674	and shall assemble the outcasts of Israel,
c42675	and gather together the dispersed of Judah from the four corners of the earth.
c42676	The envy also of Ephraim shall depart,
c42677	vex Ephraim.
c42679	and the adversaries of Judah shall be cut off: Ephraim shall not envy Judah, and Judah shall not
c42680	But they shall fly upon the shoulders of the Philistines toward the west;
c42681	they shall spoil them of the east together:
c42682	they shall lay their hand upon Edom and Moab;
c42683	and the children of Ammon shall obey them.
c42684	And the LORD shall utterly destroy the tongue of the Egyptian sea;
c42685	and with his mighty wind shall he shake his hand over the river,
c42686	and shall smite it in the seven streams,
c42687	and make <i>men</i> go over dryshod.
c42688	And there shall be an highway for the remnant of his people,
c42689	which shall be left, from Assyria;
c42690	like as it was to Israel in the day
c42691	that he came up out of the land of Egypt.
c42692	And in that day thou shalt say,
c42693	I will praise
c42694	O LORD,
c42695	thee: though thou wast angry
c42696	with me, thine anger is turned away,
c42697	and thou comfortedst me.
c42698	Behold, God <i>is</i> my salvation;
c42699	I will trust,
c42700	and not be afraid:
c42701	for the LORD JEHOVAH <i>is</i> my strength and <i>my</i> song;
c42702	he also is become my salvation.
c42703	Therefore with joy shall ye draw water out of the wells of salvation.
c42704	And in that day shall ye say,
c42705	Praise the LORD,
c42706	call upon his name,
c42707	declare his doings among the people,
c42708	make mention
c42709	that his name is exalted.
c42710	Sing unto the LORD;
c42711	for he hath done excellent things:
c42712	this <i>is</i> known in all the earth.
c42713	Cry out
c42714	and shout,
c42715	thou inhabitant of Zion:
c42716	for great <i>is</i> the Holy One of Israel in the midst of thee.
c42717	The burden of Babylon,
c42718	which Isaiah the son of Amoz did see.
c42719	Lift ye up a banner upon the high mountain,
c42720	exalt the voice
c42721	unto them, shake the hand,
c42722	that they may go into the gates of the nobles.
c42723	I have commanded my sanctified ones,
c42724	I have also called my mighty ones for mine anger, <i>even</i> them that rejoice in my highness.
c42725	The noise of a multitude in the mountains,
c42726	like as of a great people;
c42727	a tumultuous noise of the kingdoms of nations gathered together:
c42728	the LORD of hosts mustereth the host of the battle.
c42729	They come from a far country, from the end of heaven, <i>even</i> the LORD, and the weapons of his indignation,
c42730	to destroy the whole land.
c42731	Howl
c42732	ye; for the day of the LORD <i>is</i> at hand;
c42733	it shall come as a destruction from the Almighty.
c42734	Therefore shall all hands be faint,
c42735	and every man's heart shall melt:
c42736	And they shall be afraid:
c42737	pangs and sorrows shall take hold
c42738	of them; they shall be in pain as a woman that travaileth:
c42739	one at another;
c42740	they shall be amazed
c42741	their faces <i>shall be as</i> flames.
c42742	Behold, the day of the LORD cometh, cruel both with wrath and fierce anger,
c42743	to lay the land desolate:
c42744	and he shall destroy the sinners thereof out of it.
c42745	For the stars of heaven and the constellations thereof shall not give their light:
c42746	the sun shall be darkened
c42747	in his going forth,
c42748	and the moon shall not cause her light to shine.
c42749	And I will punish the world for <i>their</i> evil,
c42750	and the wicked for their iniquity;
c42751	and I will cause the arrogancy of the proud to cease,
c42752	and will lay low the haughtiness of the terrible.
c42753	I will make a man more precious than fine gold;
c42754	even a man than the golden wedge of Ophir.
c42755	Therefore I will shake the heavens,
c42756	and the earth shall remove out of her place, in the wrath of the LORD of hosts, and in the day of his fierce anger.
c42757	And it shall be
c42758	as the chased roe, and as a sheep
c42759	that no man taketh up:
c42760	they shall every man turn to his own people,
c42763	every one into his own land.
c42764	and flee
c42765	Every one that is found shall be thrust through;
c42766	and every one that is joined <i>unto them</i> shall fall by the sword.
c42767	Their children also shall be dashed to pieces before their eyes;
c42768	their houses shall be spoiled,
c42769	and their wives ravished.
c42770	Behold, I will stir up the Medes against
c42771	them, which shall not regard silver;
c42772	and <i>as for</i> gold,
c42773	they shall not delight in it.
c42774	<i>Their</i> bows also shall dash the young men
c42775	to pieces; and they shall have no pity on the fruit of the womb;
c42776	their eye shall not spare children.
c42777	And Babylon, the glory of kingdoms, the beauty of the Chaldees' excellency, shall be as when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah.
c42778	It shall never be inhabited,
c42779	neither shall it be dwelt in from generation to generation:
c42780	neither shall the Arabian pitch tent there;
c42781	neither shall the shepherds make their fold there.
c42782	But wild beasts of the desert shall lie there;
c42783	and their houses shall be full of doleful creatures;
c42784	and owls shall dwell there,
c42785	and satyrs shall dance there.
c42786	And the wild beasts of the islands shall cry in their desolate houses,
c42787	and dragons in <i>their</i> pleasant palaces:
c42788	<i>is</i> near
c42789	to come,
c42790	and her time
c42791	and her days shall not be prolonged.
c42792	For the LORD will have mercy on Jacob,
c42793	and will yet choose Israel,
c42794	and set them in their own land:
c42795	and the strangers shall be joined with
c42796	them, and they shall cleave to the house of Jacob.
c42797	And the people shall take
c42798	them, and bring them to their place:
c42799	and the house of Israel shall possess them in the land of the LORD for servants and handmaids:
c42800	and they shall take them captives, whose captives
c42801	they were; and they shall rule over their oppressors.
c42802	And it shall come to pass in the day
c42803	that the LORD shall give thee rest from thy sorrow, and from thy fear, and from the hard bondage
c42804	wherein thou wast made to serve,
c42805	That thou shalt take up this proverb against the king of Babylon,
c42806	and say,
c42807	How hath the oppressor ceased!
c42808	the golden city ceased!
c42809	The LORD hath broken the staff of the wicked, <i>and</i> the sceptre of the rulers.
c42810	He who smote the people in wrath with a continual stroke,
c42811	he that ruled the nations in anger, is persecuted,
c42812	<i>and</i> none hindereth.
c42814	The whole earth is at rest, <i>and</i> is quiet:
c42815	they break forth into singing.
c42816	Yea, the fir trees rejoice
c42817	at thee, <i>and</i> the cedars of Lebanon,
c42818	<i>saying,</i> Since thou art laid down,
c42819	no feller is come up against us.
c42820	Hell from beneath is moved
c42821	for thee to meet
c42822	<i>thee</i> at thy coming:
c42823	it stirreth up the dead for thee, <i>even</i> all the chief ones of the earth;
c42824	it hath raised up from their thrones all the kings of the nations.
c42825	All they shall speak
c42826	and say unto thee, Art thou also become weak
c42828	as we? art thou become like unto us?
c42829	Thy pomp is brought down to the grave, <i>and</i> the noise of thy viols:
c42830	the worm is spread under
c42831	thee, and the worms cover thee.
c42832	How art thou fallen from heaven,
c42833	O Lucifer, son of the morning!
c42834	<i>how</i> art thou cut down to the ground,
c42835	which didst weaken the nations!
c42836	For thou hast said in thine heart,
c42837	I will ascend into heaven,
c42838	I will exalt my throne above the stars of God:
c42839	I will sit also upon the mount of the congregation, in the sides of the north:
c42840	I will ascend above the heights of the clouds;
c42841	I will be like the most High.
c42842	Yet thou shalt be brought down to hell, to the sides of the pit.
c42843	They that see thee shall narrowly look upon
c42844	thee, <i>and</i> consider
c42845	thee, <i>saying, Is</i> this the man
c42846	that made the earth to tremble,
c42847	that did shake kingdoms;
c42848	<i>That</i> made the world as a wilderness,
c42849	and destroyed the cities
c42850	thereof; <i>that</i> opened not the house of his prisoners?
c42851	All the kings of the nations,
c42852	<i>even</i> all of them, lie in glory,
c42853	every one in his own house.
c42854	But thou art cast out of thy grave like an abominable branch,
c42855	<i>and as</i> the raiment of those that are slain, thrust through with a sword,
c42856	that go down to the stones of the pit; as a carcase trodden under feet.
c42857	Thou shalt not be joined with them in burial,
c42858	because thou hast destroyed thy land,
c42859	<i>and</i> slain thy people:
c42860	the seed of evildoers shall never be renowned.
c42861	Prepare slaughter for his children for the iniquity of their fathers;
c42862	that they do not rise,
c42863	nor possess the land,
c42864	nor fill the face of the world with cities.
c42865	For I will rise up against
c42866	them, saith the LORD of hosts,
c42867	and cut off from Babylon the name, and remnant, and son, and nephew,
c42868	saith the LORD.
c42869	I will also make it a possession for the bittern,
c42870	and pools of water:
c42871	and I will sweep it with the besom
c42872	of destruction,
c42873	saith the LORD of hosts.
c42874	The LORD of hosts hath sworn,
c42875	saying,
c42876	Surely
c42877	as I have thought,
c42878	so shall it come to pass;
c42879	and as I have purposed,
c42880	<i>so</i> shall it stand:
c42881	That I will break the Assyrian in my land,
c42882	and upon my mountains tread him under foot:
c42883	then shall his yoke depart from off
c42884	them, and his burden depart from off their shoulders.
c42885	This <i>is</i> the purpose
c42886	that is purposed upon the whole earth:
c42887	and this <i>is</i> the hand
c42888	that is stretched out upon all the nations.
c42889	For the LORD of hosts hath purposed,
c42890	and who shall disannul
c42891	<i>it?</i> and his hand <i>is</i> stretched out,
c42892	and who shall turn it back?
c42893	In the year that king Ahaz died was this burden.
c42894	Rejoice not
c42895	thou, whole Palestina,
c42896	because the rod of him that
c42897	smote thee is broken:
c42898	for out of the serpent's root shall come forth a cockatrice,
c42899	and his fruit <i>shall be</i> a fiery flying serpent.
c42900	And the firstborn of the poor shall feed,
c42901	and the needy shall lie down in safety:
c42902	and I will kill thy root with famine,
c42903	and he shall slay thy remnant.
c42904	Howl,
c42905	O gate;
c42906	cry,
c42907	O city;
c42908	<i>art</i> dissolved:
c42909	thou, whole Palestina,
c42910	for there shall come from the north a smoke,
c42911	and none <i>shall be</i> alone in his appointed times.
c42912	What shall <i>one</i> then answer the messengers of the nation?
c42913	That the LORD hath founded Zion,
c42914	and the poor of his people shall trust in it.
c42915	The burden of Moab.
c42916	Because in the night Ar of Moab is laid waste,
c42917	<i>and</i> brought to silence;
c42918	because in the night Kir of Moab is laid waste,
c42919	<i>and</i> brought to silence;
c42920	He is gone up to Bajith,
c42921	and to Dibon, the high places, to weep:
c42922	Moab shall howl over Nebo, and over Medeba:
c42923	on all their heads <i>shall be</i> baldness,
c42924	<i>and</i> every beard cut off.
c42925	In their streets they shall gird themselves with sackcloth:
c42926	on the tops of their houses, and in their streets, every one shall howl,
c42927	weeping abundantly.
c42928	And Heshbon shall cry, and Elealeh:
c42929	their voice shall be heard <i>even</i> unto Jahaz:
c42930	therefore the armed soldiers of Moab shall cry out;
c42931	his life shall be grievous unto him.
c42932	My heart shall cry out for Moab;
c42933	his fugitives <i>shall flee</i> unto Zoar, an heifer of three years old:
c42934	for by the mounting up of Luhith
c42935	with weeping shall they go it up;
c42936	for in the way of Horonaim they shall raise up a cry of destruction.
c42937	For the waters of Nimrim shall be desolate:
c42938	for the hay is withered away,
c42939	the grass faileth,
c42940	there is no green thing.
c42941	Therefore the abundance
c42942	they have gotten,
c42943	and that which they have laid up,
c42944	shall they carry away to the brook of the willows.
c42945	For the cry is gone round about the borders of Moab;
c42946	the howling thereof unto Eglaim,
c42947	and the howling thereof unto Beerelim.
c42948	For the waters of Dimon shall be full of blood:
c42949	for I will bring more upon Dimon,
c42950	lions upon him that escapeth of Moab,
c42951	and upon the remnant of the land.
c42952	Send ye the lamb
c42953	to the ruler of the land
c42954	from Sela to the wilderness, unto the mount of the daughter of Zion.
c42955	For it shall be, <i>that,</i> as a wandering bird cast out of the nest,
c42956	<i>so</i> the daughters of Moab shall be at the fords of Arnon.
c42957	Take counsel,
c42958	execute judgment;
c42959	make thy shadow as the night in the midst of the noonday;
c42960	hide the outcasts;
c42961	bewray not him that wandereth.
c42962	Let mine outcasts dwell with thee, Moab;
c42963	be thou a covert to them from the face of the spoiler:
c42964	for the extortioner is at an end,
c42965	the spoiler ceaseth,
c42966	the oppressors are consumed out of the land.
c42967	And in mercy shall the throne be established:
c42968	and he shall sit upon it in truth in the tabernacle of David,
c42969	judging,
c42970	and seeking judgment,
c42971	and hasting righteousness.
c42972	We have heard of the pride of Moab;
c42973	<i>he is</i> very proud:
c42974	<i>even</i> of his haughtiness, and his pride, and his wrath:
c42975	<i>but</i> his lies <i>shall</i> not <i>be</i> so.
c42976	Therefore shall Moab howl for Moab,
c42977	every one shall howl:
c42978	for the foundations of Kirhareseth shall ye mourn;
c42979	surely <i>they are</i> stricken.
c42980	For the fields of Heshbon languish,
c42981	<i>and</i> the vine of Sibmah:
c42982	the lords of the heathen have broken down the principal plants
c42983	thereof, they are come <i>even</i> unto Jazer,
c42984	they wandered <i>through</i> the wilderness:
c42985	her branches are stretched out,
c42986	they are gone over the sea.
c42987	Therefore I will bewail with the weeping of Jazer the vine of Sibmah:
c42988	I will water thee with my tears,
c42989	O Heshbon, and Elealeh:
c42990	for the shouting for thy summer fruits and for thy harvest is fallen.
c42991	And gladness is taken away, and joy out of the plentiful field;
c42992	and in the vineyards there shall be no singing,
c42993	neither shall there be shouting:
c42994	the treaders shall tread out no wine in <i>their</i> presses;
c42995	I have made <i>their vintage</i> shouting to cease.
c42996	Wherefore my bowels shall sound like an harp for Moab,
c42997	and mine inward parts for Kirharesh.
c42998	And it shall come to pass,
c42999	when it is seen
c43000	that Moab is weary on the high place,
c43001	that he shall come to his sanctuary
c43002	to pray;
c43003	but he shall not prevail.
c43004	This <i>is</i> the word
c43005	that the LORD hath spoken concerning Moab since that time.
c43006	But now the LORD hath spoken,
c43007	saying,
c43008	Within three years, as the years of an hireling,
c43009	and the glory of Moab shall be contemned, with all that great multitude;
c43010	and the remnant <i>shall be</i> very small
c43012	<i>and</i> feeble.
c43013	The burden of Damascus.
c43014	Behold, Damascus is taken away from <i>being</i> a city,
c43015	and it shall be a ruinous heap.
c43016	The cities of Aroer <i>are</i> forsaken:
c43017	they shall be for flocks,
c43018	which shall lie down,
c43019	and none shall make <i>them</i> afraid.
c43020	The fortress also shall cease from Ephraim,
c43021	and the kingdom from Damascus,
c43022	and the remnant of Syria: they shall be as the glory of the children of Israel,
c43023	saith the LORD of hosts.
c43024	And in that day it shall come to pass,
c43025	<i>that</i> the glory of Jacob shall be made thin,
c43026	and the fatness of his flesh shall wax lean.
c43027	And it shall be
c43028	as when the harvestman gathereth the corn,
c43029	and reapeth the ears with his arm;
c43030	and it shall be
c43031	as he that gathereth ears in the valley of Rephaim.
c43032	Yet gleaning grapes shall be left in it, as the shaking of an olive tree,
c43033	two <i>or</i> three berries in the top of the uppermost bough,
c43034	four <i>or</i> five in the outmost fruitful branches
c43035	thereof, saith the LORD God of Israel.
c43036	At that day shall a man look to his Maker,
c43037	and his eyes shall have respect to the Holy One of Israel.
c43038	And he shall not look to the altars, the work of his hands,
c43040	<i>that</i> which his fingers have made,
c43041	neither shall respect
c43042	either the groves, or the images.
c43043	In that day shall his strong cities be as a forsaken bough, and an uppermost branch, which they left
c43044	because of the children of Israel:
c43045	and there shall be desolation.
c43046	Because thou hast forgotten the God of thy salvation,
c43047	and hast not been mindful of the rock of thy strength,
c43048	therefore shalt thou plant pleasant plants,
c43049	and shalt set it with strange slips:
c43050	In the day shalt thou make thy plant to grow,
c43051	and in the morning shalt thou make thy seed to flourish:
c43052	<i>but</i> the harvest <i>shall be</i> a heap in the day of grief and of desperate sorrow.
c43053	Woe to the multitude of many people,
c43054	<i>which</i> make a noise like the noise of the seas;
c43056	and to the rushing of nations,
c43057	<i>that</i> make a rushing like the rushing of mighty waters!
c43058	The nations shall rush like the rushing of many waters:
c43059	but <i>God</i> shall rebuke
c43060	them, and they shall flee far off,
c43061	and shall be chased as the chaff of the mountains before the wind,
c43062	and like a rolling thing before the whirlwind.
c43064	And behold at eveningtide trouble;
c43065	<i>and</i> before the morning
c43066	he <i>is</i> not.
c43067	This <i>is</i> the portion of them that spoil us, and the lot of them that rob us.
c43068	Woe to the land shadowing with wings,
c43069	which <i>is</i> beyond the rivers of Ethiopia:
c43070	That sendeth ambassadors by the sea,
c43071	even in vessels of bulrushes upon the waters,
c43072	<i>saying,</i> Go,
c43073	ye swift messengers,
c43074	to a nation scattered and peeled,
c43075	to a people
c43076	terrible from their beginning hitherto;
c43077	a nation meted out and trodden down,
c43078	whose land the rivers have spoiled!
c43079	All ye inhabitants of the world, and dwellers on the earth,
c43080	ye, when he lifteth up an ensign on the mountains;
c43081	see
c43083	and when he bloweth a trumpet,
c43084	hear ye.
c43085	For so the LORD said unto
c43086	me, I will take my rest,
c43087	and I will consider in my dwelling place
c43088	like a clear heat upon herbs,
c43089	<i>and</i> like a cloud of dew
c43090	in the heat of harvest.
c43091	For afore the harvest,
c43092	when the bud is perfect,
c43093	and the sour grape is ripening in the flower,
c43094	he shall both cut off the sprigs with pruning hooks,
c43095	and take away <i>and</i> cut down the branches.
c43097	They shall be left together unto the fowls of the mountains, and to the beasts of the earth:
c43098	and the fowls shall summer upon
c43099	them, and all the beasts of the earth shall winter upon them.
c43100	In that time shall the present be brought unto the LORD of hosts
c43101	of a people scattered and peeled,
c43102	and from a people
c43103	terrible from their beginning hitherto;
c43104	a nation meted out and trodden under foot,
c43105	whose land the rivers have spoiled,
c43106	to the place of the name of the LORD of hosts, the mount Zion.
c43107	The burden of Egypt.
c43108	Behold, the LORD rideth upon a swift cloud,
c43109	and shall come into Egypt:
c43110	and the idols of Egypt shall be moved at his presence,
c43111	and the heart of Egypt shall melt in the midst of it.
c43112	And I will set the Egyptians against the Egyptians:
c43113	and they shall fight
c43114	every one against his brother,
c43115	and every one against his neighbour;
c43116	city against city,
c43117	<i>and</i> kingdom against kingdom.
c43118	And the spirit of Egypt shall fail in the midst
c43119	thereof; and I will destroy the counsel
c43120	thereof: and they shall seek to the idols, and to the charmers, and to them that have familiar spirits, and to the wizards.
c43121	And the Egyptians will I give over into the hand of a cruel lord;
c43122	and a fierce king shall rule
c43123	over them, saith the Lord, the LORD of hosts.
c43124	And the waters shall fail from the sea, and the river shall be wasted and dried up.
c43127	And they shall turn the rivers far away;
c43129	<i>and</i> the brooks of defence shall be emptied and dried up:
c43130	the reeds and flags shall wither.
c43131	The paper reeds by the brooks, by the mouth of the brooks,
c43132	and every thing sown by the brooks, shall wither,
c43133	be driven away,
c43134	and be no <i>more.</i>
c43135	The fishers also shall mourn,
c43136	and all they that cast angle into the brooks shall lament,
c43139	and they that spread nets upon the waters
c43140	shall languish.
c43141	shall be confounded.
c43142	Moreover they that work in fine flax,
c43143	and they that weave networks,
c43144	And they shall be broken in the purposes
c43145	thereof, all that make sluices <i>and</i> ponds for fish.
c43146	Surely the princes of Zoan <i>are</i> fools,
c43147	the counsel of the wise counsellors of Pharaoh is become brutish:
c43148	how say ye unto Pharaoh,
c43149	I <i>am</i> the son of the wise,
c43150	the son of ancient kings?
c43151	Where <i>are</i> they? where <i>are</i> thy wise
c43152	<i>men?</i> and let them tell thee now,
c43153	and let them know
c43154	what the LORD of hosts hath purposed upon Egypt.
c43155	The princes of Zoan are become fools,
c43156	the princes of Noph are deceived;
c43157	they have also seduced Egypt, <i>even they that are</i> the stay of the tribes thereof.
c43158	The LORD hath mingled a perverse spirit in the midst
c43159	thereof: and they have caused Egypt to err in every work
c43160	thereof, as a drunken <i>man</i> staggereth in his vomit.
c43161	Neither shall there be <i>any</i> work for Egypt,
c43162	which the head or tail, branch or rush, may do.
c43163	In that day shall Egypt be like unto women:
c43164	and it shall be afraid
c43165	and fear because of the shaking of the hand of the LORD of hosts,
c43166	which he shaketh over it.
c43167	And the land of Judah shall be a terror unto Egypt,
c43168	every one
c43169	that maketh mention thereof shall be afraid in
c43170	himself, because of the counsel of the LORD of hosts,
c43171	which he hath determined against it.
c43172	In that day shall five cities in the land of Egypt
c43173	speak the language of Canaan,
c43174	and swear to the LORD of hosts;
c43175	The city of destruction.
c43176	one shall be called,
c43177	In that day shall there be an altar to the LORD in the midst of the land of Egypt,
c43178	and a pillar at the border thereof to the LORD.
c43179	And it shall be for a sign and for a witness unto the LORD of hosts in the land of Egypt:
c43180	for they shall cry unto the LORD because of the oppressors,
c43181	and he shall send them a saviour, and a great one,
c43182	and he shall deliver them.
c43183	And the LORD shall be known to Egypt,
c43184	and the Egyptians shall know the LORD in that day,
c43185	and shall do sacrifice and oblation;
c43186	yea, they shall vow a vow unto the LORD,
c43187	and perform <i>it.</i>
c43188	And the LORD shall smite Egypt: he shall smite and heal
c43189	<i>it:</i> and they shall return <i>even</i> to the LORD,
c43190	and he shall be intreated
c43191	of them, and shall heal them.
c43192	In that day shall there be a highway out of Egypt to Assyria,
c43193	and the Assyrian shall come into Egypt,
c43194	and the Egyptian into Assyria,
c43195	and the Egyptians shall serve with the Assyrians.
c43196	In that day shall Israel be the third with Egypt and with Assyria,
c43197	<i>even</i> a blessing in the midst of the land:
c43198	Whom the LORD of hosts shall bless,
c43199	saying,
c43200	Blessed <i>be</i> Egypt my people, and Assyria the work of my hands, and Israel mine inheritance.
c43201	In the year
c43202	that Tartan came unto Ashdod,
c43203	(when Sargon the king of Assyria sent
c43204	him,) and fought against Ashdod,
c43205	and took it;
c43206	At the same time spake the LORD by Isaiah the son of Amoz,
c43207	saying,
c43208	Go
c43209	and loose the sackcloth from off thy loins,
c43210	and put off thy shoe from thy foot.
c43211	And he did so,
c43212	walking naked and barefoot.
c43213	And the LORD said,
c43214	Like as my servant Isaiah hath walked naked and barefoot three years <i>for</i> a sign and wonder upon Egypt and upon Ethiopia;
c43215	So shall the king of Assyria lead away the Egyptians prisoners, and the Ethiopians captives, young and old, naked and barefoot, even with <i>their</i> buttocks uncovered, to the shame of Egypt.
c43216	And they shall be afraid
c43217	and ashamed of Ethiopia their expectation, and of Egypt their glory.
c43218	And the inhabitant of this isle shall say in that day,
c43219	Behold, such <i>is</i> our expectation,
c43220	whither we flee for help
c43221	to be delivered from the king of Assyria:
c43222	and how shall we escape?
c43223	The burden of the desert of the sea.
c43224	As whirlwinds in the south
c43225	pass through;
c43226	<i>so</i> it cometh from the desert, from a terrible land.
c43227	A grievous vision is declared
c43228	unto me; the treacherous dealer dealeth treacherously,
c43229	and the spoiler spoileth.
c43230	Go up,
c43231	O Elam:
c43232	besiege,
c43233	O Media;
c43234	all the sighing thereof have I made to cease.
c43235	Therefore are my loins filled with pain:
c43236	pangs have taken hold upon me, as the pangs of a woman that travaileth:
c43237	I was bowed down
c43238	at the hearing
c43239	<i>of it;</i> I was dismayed
c43240	at the seeing <i>of it.</i>
c43241	My heart panted,
c43242	fearfulness affrighted
c43243	me: the night of my pleasure hath he turned into fear unto me.
c43244	Prepare the table,
c43245	watch in the watchtower,
c43246	eat,
c43247	drink:
c43248	arise,
c43249	ye princes,
c43250	<i>and</i> anoint the shield.
c43251	For thus hath the Lord said unto
c43252	me, Go,
c43253	set a watchman,
c43254	what he seeth.
c43255	let him declare
c43256	And he saw a chariot <i>with</i> a couple of horsemen, a chariot of asses, <i>and</i> a chariot of camels;
c43257	and he hearkened diligently with much heed:
c43258	And he cried,
c43259	A lion:
c43261	My lord,
c43262	I stand continually upon the watchtower in the daytime,
c43263	and I am set in my ward whole nights:
c43264	And, behold, here cometh a chariot of men, <i>with</i> a couple of horsemen.
c43265	And he answered
c43266	and said,
c43268	Babylon is fallen, is fallen;
c43269	and all the graven images of her gods he hath broken unto the ground.
c43270	O my threshing, and the corn of my floor:
c43271	that which I have heard of the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel,
c43272	have I declared unto you.
c43273	The burden of Dumah.
c43274	He calleth to me out of Seir,
c43275	Watchman,
c43276	what of the night?
c43277	Watchman,
c43278	what of the night?
c43279	The watchman said,
c43280	The morning cometh,
c43281	and also the night:
c43282	if ye will enquire,
c43283	enquire
c43284	ye: return,
c43285	come.
c43286	The burden upon Arabia.
c43287	In the forest in Arabia shall ye lodge,
c43288	O ye travelling companies of Dedanim.
c43289	to him that was thirsty,
c43290	brought water
c43291	The inhabitants of the land of Tema
c43292	they prevented with their bread him that fled.
c43293	For they fled from the swords, from the drawn sword, and from the bent bow, and from the grievousness of war.
c43294	For thus hath the Lord said unto
c43295	me, Within a year, according to the years of an hireling,
c43296	and all the glory of Kedar shall fail:
c43297	And the residue of the number of archers, the mighty men of the children of Kedar, shall be diminished:
c43298	for the LORD God of Israel hath spoken <i>it.</i>
c43299	The burden of the valley of vision.
c43300	What aileth thee now,
c43301	that thou art wholly gone up to the housetops?
c43302	Thou that art full of stirs,
c43303	a tumultuous city, a joyous city:
c43304	thy slain <i>men are</i> not slain with the sword,
c43305	nor dead in battle.
c43306	All thy rulers are fled together,
c43307	they are bound by the archers:
c43308	all that are found in thee are bound together,
c43309	<i>which</i> have fled from far.
c43310	Therefore said
c43311	I, Look away from
c43312	me; I will weep bitterly,
c43313	labour not
c43314	to comfort me, because of the spoiling of the daughter of my people.
c43315	For <i>it is</i> a day of trouble, and of treading down, and of perplexity by the Lord GOD of hosts in the valley of vision,
c43316	breaking down the walls,
c43317	and of crying to the mountains.
c43318	And Elam bare the quiver with chariots of men <i>and</i> horsemen,
c43319	and Kir uncovered the shield.
c43320	And it shall come to pass,
c43321	<i>that</i> thy choicest valleys shall be full of chariots,
c43322	and the horsemen shall set themselves in array at the gate.
c43323	And he discovered the covering of Judah,
c43324	and thou didst look in that day to the armour of the house of the forest.
c43325	Ye have seen also the breaches of the city of David,
c43326	that they are many:
c43327	and ye gathered together the waters of the lower pool.
c43328	And ye have numbered the houses of Jerusalem,
c43329	and the houses have ye broken down
c43330	to fortify the wall.
c43331	Ye made also a ditch between the two walls for the water of the old pool:
c43332	but ye have not looked unto the maker
c43334	unto him that fashioned it long ago.
c43335	thereof, neither had respect
c43336	And in that day did the Lord GOD of hosts call to weeping, and to mourning, and to baldness,
c43337	and to girding with sackcloth:
c43338	And behold joy and gladness,
c43339	slaying oxen,
c43340	and killing sheep,
c43341	eating flesh,
c43342	and drinking wine:
c43343	let us eat
c43344	and drink;
c43345	for to morrow we shall die.
c43346	And it was revealed in mine ears by the LORD of hosts, Surely this iniquity shall not be purged
c43348	from you till ye die,
c43349	saith the Lord GOD of hosts.
c43350	Thus saith the Lord GOD of hosts,
c43351	Go,
c43352	get thee unto this treasurer, <i>even</i> unto Shebna,
c43353	which <i>is</i> over the house, <i>and say,</i>
c43354	What hast thou here?
c43355	and whom hast thou here,
c43356	that thou hast hewed thee out a sepulchre here,
c43357	<i>as</i> he that heweth him out a sepulchre on high,
c43358	<i>and</i> that graveth an habitation for himself in a rock?
c43359	Behold, the LORD will carry thee away with a mighty captivity,
c43361	and will surely cover thee.
c43362	He will surely violently turn and toss
c43363	thee <i>like</i> a ball into a large country:
c43364	there shalt thou die,
c43365	and there the chariots of thy glory <i>shall be</i> the shame of thy lord's house.
c43366	And I will drive thee from thy station,
c43367	and from thy state shall he pull thee down.
c43368	And it shall come to pass in that day,
c43369	that I will call my servant Eliakim the son of Hilkiah:
c43370	And I will clothe him with thy robe,
c43371	and strengthen him with thy girdle,
c43372	and I will commit thy government into his hand:
c43373	and he shall be a father to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and to the house of Judah.
c43374	And the key of the house of David will I lay upon his shoulder;
c43375	so he shall open,
c43376	and none shall shut;
c43377	and he shall shut,
c43378	and none shall open.
c43379	And I will fasten him <i>as</i> a nail in a sure place;
c43380	and he shall be for a glorious throne to his father's house.
c43381	And they shall hang upon him all the glory of his father's house, the offspring and the issue, all vessels of small quantity, from the vessels of cups, even to all the vessels of flagons.
c43382	In that day,
c43383	saith the LORD of hosts,
c43384	shall the nail that is fastened in the sure place be removed,
c43386	and be cut down,
c43387	and fall;
c43388	and the burden that <i>was</i> upon it shall be cut off:
c43390	for the LORD hath spoken <i>it.</i>
c43391	The burden of Tyre.
c43392	Howl,
c43393	ye ships of Tarshish;
c43394	for it is laid waste, so that there is no house,
c43395	no entering in: from the land of Chittim
c43396	it is revealed to them.
c43397	Be still,
c43398	ye inhabitants of the isle;
c43399	thou whom the merchants of Zidon,
c43400	that pass over the sea,
c43401	have replenished.
c43402	And by great waters the seed of Sihor,
c43403	the harvest of the river, <i>is</i> her revenue;
c43404	and she is a mart of nations.
c43405	Be thou ashamed,
c43406	O Zidon:
c43407	for the sea hath spoken, <i>even</i> the strength of the sea,
c43408	saying,
c43409	I travail not,
c43410	nor bring forth children,
c43411	neither do I nourish up young men,
c43412	<i>nor</i> bring up virgins.
c43413	As at the report concerning Egypt,
c43414	<i>so</i> shall they be sorely pained at the report of Tyre.
c43415	Pass ye over to Tarshish;
c43416	howl,
c43417	ye inhabitants of the isle.
c43418	<i>Is</i> this your joyous
c43419	<i>city,</i> whose antiquity <i>is</i> of ancient days?
c43420	her own feet shall carry her afar off
c43421	to sojourn.
c43422	Who hath taken this counsel against Tyre, the crowning
c43423	<i>city,</i> whose merchants <i>are</i> princes,
c43424	whose traffickers <i>are</i> the honourable of the earth?
c43425	The LORD of hosts hath purposed
c43426	it, to stain the pride of all glory,
c43427	<i>and</i> to bring into contempt all the honourable of the earth.
c43428	Pass through thy land as a river,
c43429	O daughter of Tarshish:
c43430	<i>there is</i> no more strength.
c43431	He stretched out his hand over the sea,
c43432	he shook the kingdoms:
c43433	the LORD hath given a commandment against the merchant
c43434	<i>city,</i> to destroy the strong holds thereof.
c43435	And he said,
c43436	Thou shalt no more
c43437	rejoice,
c43438	O thou oppressed virgin, daughter of Zidon:
c43439	to Chittim;
c43440	arise,
c43441	pass over
c43442	there also shalt thou have no rest.
c43443	Behold the land of the Chaldeans;
c43444	this people
c43445	was not,
c43446	<i>till</i> the Assyrian founded it for them that dwell in the wilderness:
c43447	they set up the towers
c43448	thereof, they raised up the palaces
c43449	thereof; <i>and</i> he brought it to ruin.
c43450	Howl,
c43451	ye ships of Tarshish:
c43452	for your strength is laid waste.
c43453	And it shall come to pass in that day,
c43454	that Tyre shall be forgotten seventy years, according to the days of one king:
c43455	after the end of seventy years shall Tyre sing as an harlot.
c43456	Take an harp,
c43457	go about the city,
c43458	thou harlot that hast been forgotten;
c43459	make sweet
c43460	melody,
c43461	sing many
c43462	songs,
c43463	that thou mayest be remembered.
c43464	And it shall come to pass after the end of seventy years,
c43465	that the LORD will visit Tyre,
c43466	and she shall turn to her hire,
c43467	and shall commit fornication with all the kingdoms of the world upon the face of the earth.
c43468	And her merchandise and her hire shall be holiness to the LORD:
c43469	it shall not be treasured
c43470	nor laid up;
c43471	for
c43472	for them that dwell before the LORD,
c43473	her merchandise shall be
c43474	to eat sufficiently,
c43475	and for durable clothing.
c43476	Behold, the LORD maketh the earth empty,
c43477	and maketh it waste,
c43478	and turneth it upside down,
c43479	and scattereth abroad the inhabitants thereof.
c43480	And it shall be, as with the people, so with the priest;
c43481	as with the servant, so with his master;
c43482	as with the maid, so with her mistress;
c43483	as with the buyer, so with the seller;
c43484	as with the lender, so with the borrower;
c43485	as with the taker of usury,
c43486	so with the giver of usury to him.
c43487	The land shall be utterly emptied,
c43488	and utterly spoiled:
c43489	for the LORD hath spoken this word.
c43491	The earth mourneth <i>and</i> fadeth away,
c43493	the world languisheth <i>and</i> fadeth away,
c43494	the haughty people of the earth do languish.
c43495	The earth also is defiled under the inhabitants
c43496	thereof; because they have transgressed the laws,
c43497	changed the ordinance,
c43498	broken the everlasting covenant.
c43499	Therefore hath the curse devoured the earth,
c43500	therein are desolate:
c43501	and they that dwell
c43502	therefore the inhabitants of the earth are burned,
c43503	and few men left.
c43504	The new wine mourneth,
c43505	the vine languisheth,
c43506	all the merryhearted do sigh.
c43507	The mirth of tabrets ceaseth,
c43508	the noise of them that rejoice endeth,
c43509	the joy of the harp ceaseth.
c43510	They shall not drink wine with a song;
c43511	strong drink shall be bitter to them that drink it.
c43512	The city of confusion is broken down:
c43513	every house is shut up,
c43514	that no man may come in.
c43515	<i>There is</i> a crying for wine in the streets;
c43516	all joy is darkened,
c43517	the mirth of the land is gone.
c43518	In the city is left desolation, and the gate is smitten with destruction.
c43520	When thus it shall be in the midst of the land among the people,
c43521	<i>there shall be</i> as the shaking of an olive tree, <i>and</i> as the gleaning grapes
c43522	when the vintage is done.
c43523	They shall lift up their voice,
c43524	they shall sing
c43525	for the majesty of the LORD, they shall cry aloud from the sea.
c43526	Wherefore glorify ye the LORD in the fires,
c43527	<i>even</i> the name of the LORD God of Israel in the isles of the sea.
c43528	From the uttermost part of the earth have we heard songs, <i>even</i> glory to the righteous.
c43529	But I said,
c43530	My leanness,
c43531	my leanness,
c43532	woe
c43533	unto me! the treacherous dealers have dealt treacherously;
c43534	yea, the treacherous dealers have dealt very treacherously.
c43535	Fear, and the pit, and the snare, <i>are</i> upon
c43536	thee, O inhabitant of the earth.
c43537	And it shall come to pass,
c43538	<i>that</i> he who fleeth from the noise of the fear
c43539	shall fall into the pit;
c43541	and he that cometh up out of the midst of the pit
c43542	shall be taken in the snare:
c43543	for the windows from on high are open,
c43544	and the foundations of the earth do shake.
c43546	The earth is utterly broken down,
c43547	the earth is clean dissolved,
c43548	the earth is moved exceedingly.
c43549	The earth shall reel to and fro like a drunkard,
c43550	and shall be removed like a cottage;
c43551	and the transgression thereof shall be heavy upon
c43552	it; and it shall fall,
c43553	and not rise again.
c43555	And it shall come to pass in that day,
c43556	<i>that</i> the LORD shall punish the host of the high ones <i>that are</i> on high,
c43557	and the kings of the earth upon the earth.
c43558	And they shall be gathered together, <i>as</i> prisoners are gathered in the pit,
c43559	and shall be shut up in the prison,
c43560	and after many days shall they be visited.
c43561	Then the moon shall be confounded,
c43562	and the sun ashamed,
c43563	when the LORD of hosts shall reign in mount Zion, and in Jerusalem,
c43564	and before his ancients gloriously.
c43565	O LORD,
c43566	thou <i>art</i> my God;
c43567	I will exalt
c43568	thee, I will praise thy name;
c43569	for thou hast done wonderful <i>things; thy</i> counsels of old
c43570	<i>are</i> faithfulness <i>and</i> truth.
c43571	For thou hast made of a city an heap; <i>of</i> a defenced city
c43572	a ruin: a palace of strangers to be no city;
c43573	it shall never be built.
c43574	Therefore shall the strong people glorify
c43575	thee, the city of the terrible nations shall fear thee.
c43576	For thou hast been a strength to the poor,
c43577	a strength to the needy in his distress,
c43578	a refuge from the storm,
c43579	a shadow from the heat,
c43580	when the blast of the terrible ones <i>is</i> as a storm <i>against</i> the wall.
c43582	Thou shalt bring down the noise of strangers, as the heat in a dry place; <i>even</i> the heat with the shadow of a cloud:
c43583	the branch of the terrible ones shall be brought low.
c43584	And in this mountain shall the LORD of hosts make unto all people a feast of fat things, a feast of wines on the lees, of fat things full of marrow, of wines on the lees well refined.
c43585	And he will destroy in this mountain the face of the covering cast over all people, and the vail
c43586	that is spread over all nations.
c43587	He will swallow up death in victory;
c43588	and the Lord GOD will wipe away tears from off all faces;
c43589	and the rebuke of his people shall he take away from off all the earth:
c43590	for the LORD hath spoken <i>it.</i>
c43591	And it shall be said in that day,
c43592	Lo, this <i>is</i> our God;
c43593	we have waited
c43594	for him, and he will save
c43595	us: this <i>is</i> the LORD;
c43596	we have waited
c43597	for him, we will be glad
c43598	and rejoice in his salvation.
c43599	For in this mountain shall the hand of the LORD rest,
c43600	and Moab shall be trodden down under
c43601	him, even as straw is trodden down for the dunghill.
c43602	And he shall spread forth his hands in the midst
c43603	of them, as he that swimmeth spreadeth forth
c43604	<i>his hands</i> to swim:
c43605	and he shall bring down their pride together with the spoils of their hands.
c43606	And the fortress of the high fort of thy walls shall he bring down,
c43607	lay low,
c43608	<i>and</i> bring to the ground, <i>even</i> to the dust.
c43609	In that day shall this song be sung in the land of Judah;
c43610	We have a strong city;
c43611	salvation will <i>God</i> appoint <i>for</i> walls and bulwarks.
c43612	Open ye the gates,
c43613	that the righteous nation which keepeth the truth may enter in.
c43615	Thou wilt keep <i>him</i> in perfect peace, <i>whose</i> mind <i>is</i> stayed
c43616	<i>on thee:</i> because he trusteth in thee.
c43617	Trust ye in the LORD for ever:
c43618	for in the LORD JEHOVAH <i>is</i> everlasting strength:
c43619	For he bringeth down them that dwell on high;
c43620	the lofty city,
c43621	he layeth it low;
c43622	he layeth it low, <i>even</i> to the ground;
c43623	he bringeth it <i>even</i> to the dust.
c43624	The foot shall tread it down, <i>even</i> the feet of the poor, <i>and</i> the steps of the needy.
c43625	The way of the just <i>is</i> uprightness:
c43626	thou, most upright, dost weigh the path of the just.
c43627	Yea, in the way of thy judgments,
c43628	O LORD,
c43629	have we waited
c43630	for thee; the desire of <i>our</i> soul <i>is</i> to thy name, and to the remembrance of thee.
c43631	With my soul
c43632	have I desired thee in the night;
c43633	yea, with my spirit within
c43634	me will I seek thee early:
c43635	for
c43636	when thy judgments <i>are</i> in the earth,
c43637	the inhabitants of the world will learn righteousness.
c43638	Let favour be shewed to the wicked,
c43639	<i>yet</i> will he not learn righteousness:
c43640	in the land of uprightness will he deal unjustly,
c43641	and will not behold the majesty of the LORD.
c43642	LORD,
c43643	<i>when</i> thy hand is lifted up,
c43644	they will not see:
c43645	<i>but</i> they shall see,
c43646	and be ashamed for <i>their</i> envy at the people;
c43647	yea, the fire of thine enemies shall devour them.
c43648	LORD,
c43649	thou wilt ordain peace
c43650	for us: for thou also hast wrought all our works in us.
c43651	O LORD our God,
c43652	<i>other</i> lords beside thee have had dominion
c43653	over us: <i>but</i> by thee only will we make mention of thy name.
c43654	<i>They are</i> dead, they shall not live;
c43655	<i>they are</i> deceased, they shall not rise:
c43656	therefore hast thou visited
c43657	and destroyed
c43658	them, and made all their memory to perish.
c43659	Thou hast increased the nation,
c43660	O LORD,
c43661	thou hast increased the nation:
c43662	thou art glorified:
c43663	thou hadst removed <i>it</i> far <i>unto</i> all the ends of the earth.
c43664	LORD,
c43665	in trouble have they visited
c43666	thee, they poured out a prayer
c43667	<i>when</i> thy chastening <i>was</i> upon them.
c43668	Like as a woman with child, <i>that</i> draweth near
c43669	the time of her delivery,
c43670	is in pain,
c43671	<i>and</i> crieth out in her pangs;
c43672	so have we been in thy sight,
c43673	O LORD.
c43674	We have been with child,
c43675	we have been in pain,
c43676	we have as it were brought forth wind;
c43677	we have not wrought any deliverance in the earth;
c43678	neither have the inhabitants of the world fallen.
c43679	Thy dead <i>men</i> shall live, <i>together with</i> my dead body
c43680	shall they arise.
c43681	Awake
c43682	and sing,
c43683	ye that dwell in dust:
c43684	for thy dew <i>is as</i> the dew of herbs,
c43685	and the earth shall cast out the dead.
c43686	Come,
c43687	my people,
c43688	enter thou into thy chambers,
c43689	and shut thy doors about
c43690	thee: hide thyself as it were for a little moment,
c43691	until the indignation be overpast.
c43692	For, behold, the LORD cometh out of his place
c43693	to punish the inhabitants of the earth for their iniquity:
c43694	the earth also shall disclose her blood,
c43695	and shall no more cover her slain.
c43696	In that day the LORD with his sore and great and strong sword shall punish leviathan the piercing serpent, even leviathan that crooked serpent;
c43697	and he shall slay the dragon
c43698	that <i>is</i> in the sea.
c43699	In that day sing ye unto her, A vineyard of red wine.
c43701	I the LORD do keep
c43702	it; I will water it every moment:
c43703	lest <i>any</i> hurt
c43704	it, I will keep it night and day.
c43705	Fury <i>is</i> not
c43706	in me: who would set the briers <i>and</i> thorns
c43707	against me in battle? I would go
c43708	through them, I would burn them together.
c43709	Or let him take hold of my strength,
c43710	<i>that</i> he may make peace
c43711	with me; <i>and</i> he shall make peace with me.
c43712	He shall cause them that come
c43713	of Jacob to take root:
c43715	Israel shall blossom and bud,
c43716	and fill the face of the world with fruit.
c43717	Hath he smitten him, as he smote those that smote
c43718	him? <i>or</i> is he slain according to the slaughter of them that are slain by him?
c43719	In measure,
c43720	when it shooteth forth,
c43721	thou wilt debate
c43722	with it: he stayeth his rough wind in the day of the east wind.
c43723	By this therefore shall the iniquity of Jacob be purged;
c43724	and this <i>is</i> all the fruit
c43725	to take away his sin;
c43726	when he maketh all the stones of the altar as chalkstones that are beaten in sunder,
c43727	the groves and images shall not stand up.
c43728	Yet the defenced city <i>shall be</i> desolate,
c43729	<i>and</i> the habitation forsaken, and left like a wilderness:
c43730	there shall the calf feed,
c43731	and there shall he lie down,
c43732	and consume the branches thereof.
c43733	When the boughs thereof are withered,
c43734	they shall be broken off:
c43735	the women come,
c43736	<i>and</i> set them on fire:
c43737	for it <i>is</i> a people of no understanding: therefore he
c43738	that made them will not have mercy
c43739	on them, and he that formed them will shew them no favour.
c43740	And it shall come to pass in that day,
c43741	<i>that</i> the LORD shall beat off from the channel of the river unto the stream of Egypt,
c43742	and ye shall be gathered one by one,
c43743	O ye children of Israel.
c43744	And it shall come to pass in that day,
c43745	<i>that</i> the great trumpet shall be blown,
c43746	and they shall come
c43747	which were ready to perish in the land of Assyria,
c43748	and the outcasts in the land of Egypt,
c43749	and shall worship the LORD in the holy mount at Jerusalem.
c43750	Woe to the crown of pride, to the drunkards of Ephraim,
c43751	whose glorious beauty <i>is</i> a fading flower,
c43752	which <i>are</i> on the head of the fat valleys
c43753	of them that are overcome with wine!
c43754	Behold, the Lord hath a mighty and strong one,
c43755	<i>which</i> as a tempest of hail <i>and</i> a destroying storm, as a flood of mighty waters overflowing, shall cast down to the earth with the hand.
c43756	The crown of pride, the drunkards of Ephraim, shall be trodden under feet:
c43757	And the glorious beauty, which <i>is</i> on the head of the fat valley, shall be a fading flower,
c43759	<i>and</i> as the hasty fruit before the summer;
c43760	which <i>when</i> he that looketh upon it seeth,
c43761	while it is yet in his hand
c43762	he eateth it up.
c43763	In that day shall the LORD of hosts be for a crown of glory, and for a diadem of beauty, unto the residue of his people,
c43764	And for a spirit of judgment
c43765	to him that sitteth in judgment,
c43766	and for strength
c43767	to them that turn the battle to the gate.
c43768	But they also have erred through wine,
c43769	and through strong drink are out of the way;
c43770	the priest and the prophet have erred through strong drink,
c43771	they are swallowed up of wine,
c43772	they are out of the way through strong drink;
c43773	they err in vision,
c43774	they stumble <i>in</i> judgment.
c43775	For all tables are full of vomit <i>and</i> filthiness, <i>so that there is</i> no place <i>clean.</i>
c43776	Whom shall he teach knowledge?
c43777	and whom shall he make to understand doctrine?
c43778	<i>them that are</i> weaned from the milk,
c43779	<i>and</i> drawn from the breasts.
c43780	For precept <i>must be</i> upon precept,
c43781	precept upon precept;
c43782	line upon line,
c43783	line upon line;
c43784	here a little,
c43785	<i>and</i> there a little:
c43786	For with stammering lips and another tongue will he speak to this people.
c43787	To whom he said,
c43788	This <i>is</i> the rest
c43789	<i>wherewith</i> ye may cause the weary to rest;
c43790	and this <i>is</i> the refreshing:
c43791	yet they would not
c43792	hear.
c43793	But the word of the LORD was
c43794	unto them precept upon precept,
c43795	precept upon precept;
c43796	line upon line,
c43797	line upon line;
c43798	here a little,
c43799	<i>and</i> there a little;
c43800	that they might go,
c43801	and fall backward,
c43802	and be broken,
c43803	and snared,
c43804	and taken.
c43805	Wherefore hear the word of the LORD,
c43806	ye scornful men,
c43807	that rule this people
c43808	which <i>is</i> in Jerusalem.
c43809	Because ye have said,
c43810	We have made a covenant with death,
c43811	and with hell are we at agreement;
c43813	when the overflowing scourge shall pass through,
c43814	it shall not come
c43815	unto us: for we have made lies our refuge,
c43816	and under falsehood have we hid ourselves:
c43817	Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD,
c43818	Behold, I lay in Zion for a foundation a stone, a tried stone, a precious corner <i>stone,</i> a sure foundation:
c43819	he that believeth
c43820	shall not make haste.
c43821	Judgment also will I lay to the line,
c43822	and righteousness to the plummet:
c43823	and the hail shall sweep away the refuge of lies,
c43824	and the waters shall overflow the hiding place.
c43825	And your covenant with death shall be disannulled,
c43826	and your agreement with hell shall not stand;
c43828	when the overflowing scourge shall pass through,
c43829	then ye shall be trodden down by it.
c43830	From the time that it goeth forth
c43831	it shall take
c43832	you: for morning by morning shall it pass over, by day and by night:
c43833	and it shall be a vexation only
c43834	<i>to</i> understand the report.
c43835	For the bed is shorter
c43836	than that <i>a man</i> can stretch himself
c43837	<i>on it:</i> and the covering narrower
c43838	than that he can wrap himself <i>in it.</i>
c43839	For the LORD shall rise up as <i>in</i> mount Perazim,
c43840	he shall be wroth as <i>in</i> the valley of Gibeon,
c43841	that he may do his work,
c43842	his strange work;
c43843	and bring to pass his act,
c43844	his strange act.
c43845	Now therefore be ye not mockers,
c43846	lest your bands be made strong:
c43847	for I have heard from the Lord GOD of hosts a consumption, even determined upon the whole earth.
c43848	Give ye ear,
c43849	and hear my voice;
c43850	hearken,
c43851	and hear my speech.
c43852	Doth the plowman plow all day
c43853	to sow?
c43854	doth he open
c43855	and break the clods of his ground?
c43856	thereof, doth he not
c43857	When he hath made plain the face
c43858	cast abroad the fitches,
c43859	and scatter the cummin,
c43860	and cast in the principal wheat
c43861	and the appointed barley
c43862	and the rie in their place?
c43864	For his God doth instruct him to discretion, <i>and</i> doth teach him.
c43865	For the fitches are not threshed with a threshing instrument,
c43866	neither is a cart wheel turned about upon the cummin;
c43867	but the fitches are beaten out with a staff,
c43868	and the cummin with a rod.
c43869	Bread <i>corn</i> is bruised;
c43870	because he will not ever be threshing
c43871	it, nor break <i>it with</i> the wheel of his cart, nor bruise it <i>with</i> his horsemen.
c43873	This also cometh forth from the LORD of hosts,
c43874	<i>which</i> is wonderful in counsel,
c43875	<i>and</i> excellent in working.
c43876	Woe to Ariel, to Ariel, the city
c43877	<i>where</i> David dwelt!
c43878	add ye year to year;
c43879	let them kill sacrifices.
c43880	Yet I will distress Ariel,
c43881	and there shall be heaviness and sorrow:
c43882	and it shall be unto me as Ariel.
c43883	And I will camp against thee round about,
c43884	and will lay siege against thee with a mount,
c43885	and I will raise forts against thee.
c43886	And thou shalt be brought down,
c43887	<i>and</i> shalt speak out of the ground,
c43888	and thy speech shall be low out of the dust,
c43889	and thy voice shall be, as of one that hath a familiar spirit, out of the ground,
c43890	and thy speech shall whisper out of the dust.
c43891	Moreover the multitude of thy strangers shall be like small dust,
c43892	and the multitude of the terrible ones <i>shall be</i> as chaff that passeth away:
c43893	yea, it shall be at an instant suddenly.
c43894	Thou shalt be visited of the LORD of hosts with thunder, and with earthquake, and great noise, with storm and tempest, and the flame of devouring fire.
c43895	And the multitude of all the nations that fight against Ariel,
c43897	even all that fight against her and her munition,
c43898	and that distress her, shall be as a dream of a night vision.
c43899	It shall even be
c43900	as when an hungry <i>man</i> dreameth,
c43901	and, behold, he eateth;
c43902	but he awaketh,
c43903	and his soul is empty:
c43904	or as when a thirsty man dreameth,
c43905	and, behold, he drinketh;
c43906	but he awaketh,
c43907	and, behold, <i>he is</i> faint,
c43908	and his soul hath appetite:
c43909	so shall the multitude of all the nations be,
c43910	that fight against mount Zion.
c43911	Stay yourselves,
c43912	and wonder;
c43913	cry ye out,
c43914	and cry:
c43915	they are drunken,
c43916	but not with wine;
c43917	they stagger,
c43918	but not with strong drink.
c43919	For the LORD hath poured out upon you the spirit of deep sleep,
c43920	and hath closed your eyes: the prophets
c43921	and your rulers, the seers hath he covered.
c43922	And the vision of all is become unto you as the words of a book that is sealed,
c43923	which <i>men</i> deliver to one that is learned,
c43924	saying,
c43925	Read this, I pray thee:
c43926	and he saith,
c43927	I cannot;
c43928	for it <i>is</i> sealed:
c43929	And the book is delivered
c43930	to him that is not learned,
c43931	saying,
c43932	Read this, I pray thee:
c43933	and he saith,
c43934	I am not learned.
c43935	Wherefore the Lord said,
c43936	Forasmuch as this people draw near <i>me</i> with their mouth,
c43937	and with their lips do honour
c43938	me, but have removed their heart far from
c43939	me, and their fear toward me is taught by the precept of men:
c43940	Therefore, behold, I will proceed
c43941	to do a marvellous work among this people, <i>even</i> a marvellous work and a wonder:
c43942	for the wisdom of their wise <i>men</i> shall perish,
c43943	and the understanding of their prudent <i>men</i> shall be hid.
c43944	Woe
c43945	unto them that seek deep to hide their counsel from the LORD,
c43947	and their works are in the dark,
c43948	and they say,
c43949	Who seeth
c43950	us? and who knoweth us?
c43952	Surely your turning of things upside down shall be esteemed as the potter's clay:
c43953	for shall the work say of him that made
c43954	it, He made me not?
c43955	or shall the thing framed say of him that framed
c43956	it, He had no understanding?
c43957	<i>Is</i> it not yet a very little while,
c43958	and Lebanon shall be turned into a fruitful field,
c43959	and the fruitful field shall be esteemed as a forest?
c43960	And in that day shall the deaf hear the words of the book,
c43961	and the eyes of the blind shall see out of obscurity, and out of darkness.
c43962	The meek also shall increase <i>their</i> joy in the LORD,
c43963	and the poor among men shall rejoice in the Holy One of Israel.
c43964	For the terrible one is brought to nought,
c43965	and the scorner is consumed,
c43966	and all that watch for iniquity are cut off:
c43967	That make a man an offender for a word,
c43968	and lay a snare for him that reproveth in the gate,
c43969	and turn aside the just for a thing of nought.
c43970	Therefore thus saith the LORD, who redeemed Abraham, concerning the house of Jacob,
c43972	Jacob shall not now be ashamed,
c43973	neither shall his face now wax pale.
c43974	But when
c43975	he seeth his children, the work of mine hands, in the midst
c43976	of him, they shall sanctify my name,
c43977	and sanctify the Holy One of Jacob,
c43978	and shall fear the God of Israel.
c43979	They also that erred in spirit shall come to understanding,
c43980	and they that murmured shall learn doctrine.
c43981	Woe to the rebellious children,
c43983	saith the LORD,
c43984	that take counsel,
c43985	but not of
c43986	me; and that cover with a covering,
c43987	but not of my spirit,
c43988	that they may add sin to sin:
c43989	That walk
c43990	to go down into Egypt,
c43991	and have not asked at my mouth;
c43992	to strengthen themselves in the strength of Pharaoh,
c43993	and to trust in the shadow of Egypt!
c43994	Therefore shall the strength of Pharaoh be your shame,
c43995	and the trust in the shadow of Egypt <i>your</i> confusion.
c43996	For his princes were at Zoan,
c43997	and his ambassadors came to Hanes.
c43998	They were all ashamed of a people
c43999	<i>that</i> could not profit
c44000	them, nor be an help
c44001	nor
c44002	profit,
c44003	but a shame,
c44004	and also a reproach.
c44005	The burden of the beasts of the south:
c44006	into the land of trouble and anguish,
c44007	from whence <i>come</i> the young and old lion,
c44008	the viper and fiery flying serpent,
c44009	they will carry their riches upon the shoulders of young asses,
c44010	and their treasures upon the bunches of camels,
c44011	to a people
c44012	<i>that</i> shall not profit <i>them.</i>
c44013	For the Egyptians shall help in vain, and to no purpose:
c44014	therefore have I cried concerning this,
c44015	Their strength
c44016	<i>is</i> to sit still.
c44017	Now go,
c44018	write it before them in a table,
c44019	and note it in a book,
c44020	that it may be for the time to come for ever and ever:
c44021	That this <i>is</i> a rebellious people,
c44022	lying children,
c44023	children
c44024	<i>that</i> will not
c44025	hear the law of the LORD:
c44026	Which say to the seers,
c44027	See not;
c44028	and to the prophets,
c44029	Prophesy not unto us right things,
c44030	speak unto us smooth things,
c44031	prophesy deceits:
c44032	Get you out of the way,
c44033	turn aside out of the path,
c44034	cause the Holy One of Israel to cease from before us.
c44035	Wherefore thus saith the Holy One of Israel,
c44036	Because ye despise this word,
c44037	and trust in oppression and perverseness,
c44038	and stay thereon:
c44039	Therefore this iniquity shall be to you as a breach ready to fall,
c44040	swelling out in a high wall,
c44041	whose breaking cometh suddenly at an instant.
c44042	And he shall break it as the breaking of the potters' vessel
c44043	that is broken in pieces;
c44044	he shall not spare:
c44045	so that there shall not be found in the bursting of it a sherd
c44046	to take fire from the hearth,
c44047	or to take water <i>withal</i> out of the pit.
c44048	For thus saith the Lord GOD, the Holy One of Israel;
c44049	In returning and rest shall ye be saved;
c44050	in quietness and in confidence shall be your strength:
c44051	and ye would not.
c44052	But ye said,
c44053	No;
c44054	for we will flee upon horses;
c44055	therefore shall ye flee:
c44057	and, We will ride upon the swift;
c44058	therefore shall they that pursue you be swift.
c44059	One thousand <i>shall flee</i> at the rebuke of one;
c44060	at the rebuke of five shall ye flee:
c44061	till ye be left as a beacon upon the top of a mountain, and as an ensign on an hill.
c44062	And therefore will the LORD wait,
c44063	that he may be gracious
c44064	unto you, and therefore will he be exalted,
c44065	that he may have mercy
c44066	upon you: for the LORD <i>is</i> a God of judgment:
c44067	blessed <i>are</i> all
c44068	they that wait for him.
c44069	For
c44070	the people shall dwell in Zion
c44071	at Jerusalem:
c44072	thou shalt weep no more:
c44073	he will be very gracious unto thee at the voice
c44074	of thy cry;
c44075	when he shall hear
c44076	it, he will answer thee.
c44077	And <i>though</i> the Lord give you the bread of adversity, and the water of affliction,
c44078	yet shall not thy teachers be removed into a corner any more,
c44079	but thine eyes shall see thy teachers:
c44080	And thine ears shall hear a word behind
c44081	thee, saying,
c44082	This <i>is</i> the way,
c44083	walk
c44084	ye in it, when ye turn to the right hand,
c44085	and when ye turn to the left.
c44086	Ye shall defile also the covering of thy graven images of silver, and the ornament of thy molten images of gold:
c44087	thou shalt cast them away as a menstruous cloth;
c44088	unto it, Get thee hence.
c44089	thou shalt say
c44090	Then shall he give the rain of thy seed,
c44091	that thou shalt sow the ground
c44092	withal; and bread of the increase of the earth,
c44093	and it shall be fat and plenteous:
c44094	in that day shall thy cattle feed in large pastures.
c44095	The oxen likewise and the young asses
c44096	that ear the ground
c44097	shall eat clean provender,
c44098	which hath been winnowed with the shovel and with the fan.
c44099	And there shall be upon every high mountain, and upon every high hill, rivers <i>and</i> streams of waters in the day of the great slaughter,
c44100	when the towers fall.
c44101	Moreover the light of the moon shall be as the light of the sun,
c44102	and the light of the sun shall be sevenfold, as the light of seven days, in the day
c44103	that the LORD bindeth up the breach of his people,
c44104	and healeth the stroke of their wound.
c44105	Behold, the name of the LORD cometh from far,
c44106	burning <i>with</i> his anger,
c44107	and the burden <i>thereof is</i> heavy:
c44108	his lips are full of indignation,
c44109	and his tongue as a devouring fire:
c44110	And his breath, as an overflowing stream,
c44111	shall reach to the midst of the neck,
c44112	to sift the nations with the sieve of vanity:
c44113	and <i>there shall be</i> a bridle in the jaws of the people, causing <i>them</i> to err.
c44114	Ye shall have a song, as in the night
c44115	<i>when</i> a holy solemnity is kept;
c44116	and gladness of heart,
c44117	as when one goeth with a pipe
c44118	to come into the mountain of the LORD, to the mighty One of Israel.
c44119	And the LORD shall cause his glorious voice to be heard,
c44120	and shall shew the lighting down of his arm, with the indignation of <i>his</i> anger, and <i>with</i> the flame of a devouring fire, <i>with</i> scattering, and tempest, and hailstones.
c44121	For through the voice of the LORD shall the Assyrian be beaten down,
c44122	<i>which</i> smote with a rod.
c44123	And <i>in</i> every place where the grounded staff shall pass, which the LORD shall lay upon him, <i>it</i> shall be
c44125	with tabrets and harps: and in battles of shaking will he fight with it.
c44126	For Tophet <i>is</i> ordained of old;
c44127	yea, for the king it is prepared;
c44128	he hath made <i>it</i> deep
c44129	<i>and</i> large:
c44130	the pile thereof <i>is</i> fire and much wood;
c44131	the breath of the LORD, like a stream of brimstone, doth kindle it.
c44132	Woe
c44133	to them that go down to Egypt for help;
c44134	and stay on horses,
c44135	and trust in chariots,
c44136	because <i>they are</i> many;
c44137	and in horsemen,
c44138	because they are very strong;
c44139	but they look not unto the Holy One of Israel,
c44140	neither seek the LORD!
c44141	Yet he also <i>is</i> wise,
c44142	and will bring evil,
c44143	and will not call back his words:
c44144	but will arise against the house of the evildoers, and against the help of them that work iniquity.
c44145	Now the Egyptians <i>are</i> men,
c44146	and not God;
c44147	and their horses flesh,
c44148	and not spirit.
c44149	When the LORD shall stretch out his hand,
c44150	both he that helpeth shall fall,
c44151	and he that is holpen shall fall down,
c44152	and they all shall fail together.
c44153	For thus hath the LORD spoken unto
c44154	me, Like as the lion and the young lion roaring on his prey,
c44155	when a multitude of shepherds is called forth against
c44156	him, <i>he</i> will not be afraid of their voice,
c44157	nor abase himself for the noise
c44158	of them: so shall the LORD of hosts come down
c44159	to fight
c44160	for mount Zion, and for the hill thereof.
c44161	As birds flying,
c44162	so will the LORD of hosts defend Jerusalem;
c44163	defending
c44164	also he will deliver
c44165	<i>it; and</i> passing over
c44166	he will preserve it.
c44167	Turn
c44168	ye unto <i>him from</i> whom the children of Israel have deeply revolted.
c44170	For in that day every man shall cast away his idols of silver, and his idols of gold,
c44171	which your own hands have made unto you <i>for</i> a sin.
c44172	Then shall the Assyrian fall with the sword,
c44173	not of a mighty man;
c44174	and the sword,
c44175	not of a mean man,
c44176	shall devour
c44177	him: but he shall flee from the sword,
c44178	and his young men shall be discomfited.
c44179	And he shall pass over to his strong hold for fear,
c44180	and his princes shall be afraid of the ensign,
c44181	saith the LORD,
c44182	whose fire <i>is</i> in Zion,
c44183	and his furnace in Jerusalem.
c44184	Behold, a king shall reign in righteousness,
c44185	and princes
c44186	shall rule in judgment.
c44187	And a man shall be as an hiding place from the wind, and a covert from the tempest;
c44188	as rivers of water in a dry place, as the shadow of a great rock in a weary land.
c44189	And the eyes of them that see shall not be dim,
c44190	and the ears of them that hear shall hearken.
c44191	The heart also of the rash shall understand knowledge,
c44192	and the tongue of the stammerers shall be ready
c44193	to speak plainly.
c44194	The vile person shall be no more called
c44195	liberal,
c44196	nor the churl said
c44197	<i>to be</i> bountiful.
c44198	For the vile person will speak villany,
c44199	and his heart will work iniquity,
c44200	to practise hypocrisy,
c44201	and to utter error against the LORD,
c44202	to make empty the soul of the hungry,
c44203	and he will cause the drink of the thirsty to fail.
c44205	The instruments also of the churl <i>are</i> evil:
c44206	he deviseth wicked devices
c44207	to destroy the poor with lying words,
c44208	even when the needy speaketh right.
c44209	But the liberal deviseth liberal things;
c44210	and by liberal things shall he stand.
c44211	ye women that are at ease;
c44212	Rise up,
c44213	hear my voice,
c44214	ye careless daughters;
c44215	give ear unto my speech.
c44216	Many days and years shall ye be troubled,
c44217	ye careless women:
c44218	for the vintage shall fail,
c44219	the gathering
c44220	shall not come.
c44221	Tremble,
c44222	ye women that are at ease;
c44223	be troubled,
c44224	ye careless ones:
c44225	strip
c44226	you, and make you bare,
c44227	and gird <i>sackcloth</i> upon <i>your</i> loins.
c44228	They shall lament for the teats, for the pleasant fields, for the fruitful vine.
c44229	Upon the land of my people
c44230	shall come up thorns <i>and</i> briers;
c44231	yea, upon all the houses of joy <i>in</i> the joyous city:
c44232	Because the palaces shall be forsaken;
c44233	the multitude of the city shall be left;
c44234	the forts and towers shall be for dens for ever,
c44235	a joy of wild asses,
c44236	a pasture of flocks;
c44237	Until the spirit be poured upon us from on high,
c44238	and the wilderness be a fruitful field,
c44239	and the fruitful field be counted for a forest.
c44240	Then judgment shall dwell in the wilderness,
c44241	and righteousness remain in the fruitful field.
c44242	And the work of righteousness shall be peace;
c44243	and the effect of righteousness quietness and assurance for ever.
c44244	And my people shall dwell in a peaceable habitation, and in sure dwellings, and in quiet resting places;
c44245	When it shall hail,
c44246	coming down on the forest;
c44247	and the city shall be low in a low place.
c44248	Blessed
c44249	<i>are</i> ye that sow beside all waters,
c44250	that send forth <i>thither</i> the feet of the ox and the ass.
c44251	Woe
c44252	to thee that spoilest,
c44253	and thou <i>wast</i> not spoiled;
c44255	and dealest treacherously,
c44256	and they dealt not treacherously
c44257	with thee! when thou shalt cease to spoil,
c44258	thou shalt be spoiled;
c44259	<i>and</i> when thou shalt make an end
c44260	to deal treacherously,
c44261	they shall deal treacherously with thee.
c44262	O LORD,
c44263	be gracious
c44264	unto us; we have waited
c44265	for thee: be thou their arm every morning,
c44266	our salvation also in the time of trouble.
c44267	At the noise of the tumult the people fled;
c44268	at the lifting up of thyself the nations were scattered.
c44269	And your spoil shall be gathered <i>like</i> the gathering of the caterpiller:
c44270	as the running to and fro of locusts shall he run upon them.
c44271	The LORD is exalted;
c44272	for he dwelleth on high:
c44273	he hath filled Zion with judgment and righteousness.
c44275	And wisdom and knowledge shall be the stability of thy times, <i>and</i> strength of salvation:
c44276	the fear of the LORD
c44277	<i>is</i> his treasure.
c44278	Behold, their valiant ones shall cry without:
c44279	the ambassadors of peace shall weep bitterly.
c44280	The highways lie waste,
c44281	the wayfaring man ceaseth:
c44282	he hath broken the covenant,
c44283	he hath despised the cities,
c44284	he regardeth no man.
c44286	The earth mourneth <i>and</i> languisheth:
c44287	Lebanon is ashamed
c44288	<i>and</i> hewn down:
c44289	Sharon is like a wilderness;
c44290	and Bashan and Carmel shake off <i>their fruits.</i>
c44291	Now will I rise,
c44292	saith the LORD;
c44293	now will I be exalted;
c44294	now will I lift up myself.
c44295	Ye shall conceive chaff,
c44296	ye shall bring forth stubble:
c44297	your breath, <i>as</i> fire,
c44298	shall devour you.
c44299	And the people shall be <i>as</i> the burnings of lime:
c44300	<i>as</i> thorns cut up
c44301	shall they be burned in the fire.
c44302	Hear,
c44303	ye <i>that are</i> far off,
c44304	what I have done;
c44305	acknowledge
c44306	and, ye <i>that are</i> near,
c44307	my might.
c44308	The sinners in Zion are afraid;
c44309	fearfulness hath surprised the hypocrites.
c44310	Who among us shall dwell with the devouring fire?
c44311	who among us shall dwell with everlasting burnings?
c44312	He that walketh righteously,
c44313	and speaketh uprightly;
c44314	he that despiseth the gain of oppressions,
c44315	that shaketh his hands
c44316	from holding of bribes,
c44317	that stoppeth his ears
c44318	from hearing of blood,
c44319	and shutteth his eyes
c44320	from seeing evil;
c44321	He shall dwell on high:
c44322	his place of defence <i>shall be</i> the munitions of rocks:
c44323	bread shall be given
c44324	him; his waters <i>shall be</i> sure.
c44325	Thine eyes shall see the king in his beauty:
c44326	they shall behold the land that is very far off.
c44327	Thine heart shall meditate terror.
c44328	Where <i>is</i> the scribe?
c44329	where <i>is</i> the receiver?
c44330	where
c44331	<i>is</i> he that counted the towers?
c44332	Thou shalt not see a fierce people, a people
c44333	of a deeper speech
c44334	than thou canst perceive;
c44335	of a stammering tongue,
c44336	<i>that thou canst</i> not understand.
c44337	Look upon Zion, the city of our solemnities:
c44338	thine eyes shall see Jerusalem a quiet habitation, a tabernacle
c44339	<i>that</i> shall not be taken down;
c44340	not one of the stakes thereof shall ever be removed,
c44341	neither shall any of the cords thereof be broken.
c44342	But there the glorious LORD
c44343	<i>will be</i> unto us a place of broad rivers <i>and</i> streams;
c44344	wherein shall go no galley with oars,
c44345	neither shall gallant ship pass thereby.
c44346	For the LORD <i>is</i> our judge,
c44347	the LORD <i>is</i> our lawgiver,
c44348	the LORD <i>is</i> our king;
c44349	he will save us.
c44350	Thy tacklings are loosed;
c44351	they could not well strengthen their mast,
c44352	they could not spread the sail:
c44353	then is the prey of a great spoil divided;
c44355	the lame take the prey.
c44356	And the inhabitant shall not say,
c44357	I am sick:
c44358	the people
c44359	that dwell
c44360	therein <i>shall be</i> forgiven <i>their</i> iniquity.
c44361	Come near,
c44362	ye nations,
c44363	to hear;
c44365	ye people:
c44366	and hearken,
c44367	let the earth hear, and all that is therein;
c44368	the world, and all things that come forth of it.
c44369	For the indignation of the LORD <i>is</i> upon all nations,
c44370	and <i>his</i> fury upon all their armies:
c44371	he hath utterly destroyed
c44372	them, he hath delivered them to the slaughter.
c44373	Their slain also shall be cast out,
c44374	out of their carcases,
c44375	and their stink shall come up
c44376	and the mountains shall be melted with their blood.
c44377	And all the host of heaven shall be dissolved,
c44378	and the heavens shall be rolled together as a scroll:
c44379	and all their host shall fall down,
c44380	as the leaf falleth off from the vine,
c44381	and as a falling <i>fig</i> from the fig tree.
c44382	For my sword shall be bathed in heaven:
c44383	behold, it shall come down upon Idumea,
c44384	and upon the people of my curse, to judgment.
c44385	The sword of the LORD is filled with blood,
c44386	it is made fat with fatness, <i>and</i> with the blood of lambs and goats, with the fat of the kidneys of rams:
c44387	for the LORD hath a sacrifice in Bozrah,
c44388	and a great slaughter in the land of Idumea.
c44389	And the unicorns shall come down with
c44390	them, and the bullocks with the bulls;
c44391	and their land shall be soaked with blood,
c44392	and their dust made fat with fatness.
c44393	For <i>it is</i> the day of the LORD'S vengeance, <i>and</i> the year of recompences for the controversy of Zion.
c44394	And the streams thereof shall be turned into pitch,
c44395	and the dust thereof into brimstone,
c44396	and the land thereof shall become burning pitch.
c44397	It shall not be quenched night nor day;
c44398	the smoke thereof shall go up for ever:
c44399	from generation to generation it shall lie waste;
c44400	none shall pass through it for ever and ever.
c44401	But the cormorant and the bittern shall possess
c44402	it; the owl also and the raven shall dwell
c44403	in it: and he shall stretch out upon it the line of confusion, and the stones of emptiness.
c44405	They shall call the nobles thereof to the kingdom, but none <i>shall be</i> there,
c44406	and all her princes shall be nothing.
c44407	And thorns shall come up in her palaces,
c44408	nettles and brambles in the fortresses
c44409	thereof: and it shall be an habitation of dragons,
c44410	<i>and</i> a court for owls.
c44411	The wild beasts of the desert shall also meet with the wild beasts of the island,
c44412	and the satyr shall cry to his fellow;
c44413	the screech owl also shall rest there,
c44414	and find for herself a place of rest.
c44415	There shall the great owl make her nest,
c44416	and lay,
c44417	and hatch,
c44418	and gather under her shadow:
c44419	there shall the vultures also be gathered, every one with her mate.
c44420	Seek ye out of the book of the LORD,
c44421	and read:
c44422	no one of these shall fail,
c44423	none shall want her mate:
c44424	for my mouth
c44425	it hath commanded,
c44426	and his spirit
c44427	it hath gathered them.
c44428	And he hath cast the lot
c44429	for them, and his hand hath divided it unto them by line:
c44430	they shall possess it for ever,
c44431	from generation to generation shall they dwell therein.
c44432	The wilderness and the solitary place shall be glad
c44433	for them; and the desert shall rejoice,
c44434	and blossom as the rose.
c44435	It shall blossom abundantly,
c44436	and rejoice even with joy
c44437	and singing:
c44438	the glory of Lebanon shall be given unto it, the excellency of Carmel and Sharon,
c44439	they shall see the glory of the LORD, <i>and</i> the excellency of our God.
c44440	Strengthen ye the weak hands,
c44441	and confirm the feeble knees.
c44442	Say to them <i>that are</i> of a fearful heart,
c44443	Be strong,
c44444	fear not:
c44445	behold, your God will come <i>with</i> vengeance, <i>even</i> God <i>with</i> a recompence;
c44446	he will come
c44447	and save you.
c44448	Then the eyes of the blind shall be opened,
c44449	and the ears of the deaf shall be unstopped.
c44450	Then shall the lame <i>man</i> leap as an hart,
c44451	and the tongue of the dumb sing:
c44452	for in the wilderness shall waters break out,
c44453	and streams in the desert.
c44454	And the parched ground shall become a pool,
c44455	and the thirsty land springs of water:
c44456	in the habitation of dragons, where each lay,
c44457	<i>shall be</i> grass with reeds and rushes.
c44458	And an highway shall be there, and a way,
c44460	The way of holiness;
c44461	and it shall be called
c44462	the unclean shall not pass over
c44463	it; but it
c44464	<i>shall be</i> for those: the wayfaring men, though fools, shall not err <i>therein.</i>
c44465	No lion shall be there,
c44466	nor <i>any</i> ravenous beast shall go up
c44467	thereon, it shall not be found there;
c44468	but the redeemed shall walk <i>there:</i>
c44469	And the ransomed of the LORD shall return,
c44470	and come to Zion with songs
c44471	and everlasting joy upon their heads: they shall obtain joy and gladness,
c44473	and sorrow and sighing shall flee away.
c44474	Now it came to pass in the fourteenth year of king Hezekiah,
c44475	<i>that</i> Sennacherib king of Assyria came up against all the defenced cities of Judah,
c44476	and took them.
c44477	And the king of Assyria sent Rabshakeh from Lachish to Jerusalem unto king Hezekiah with a great army.
c44478	And he stood by the conduit of the upper pool in the highway of the fuller's field.
c44479	Then came forth unto him Eliakim, Hilkiah's son,
c44480	which was over the house,
c44481	and Shebna the scribe, and Joah, Asaph's son, the recorder.
c44482	And Rabshakeh said unto
c44483	them, Say ye now to Hezekiah,
c44484	Thus saith the great king, the king of Assyria,
c44485	What confidence <i>is</i> this
c44486	wherein thou trustest?
c44487	I say,
c44488	<i>sayest thou,</i> (but <i>they are but</i> vain words) <i>I have</i> counsel and strength for war:
c44489	now on whom dost thou trust,
c44490	that thou rebellest against me?
c44491	Lo, thou trustest in the staff of this broken reed, on Egypt;
c44492	whereon if a man lean,
c44493	it will go into his hand,
c44494	and pierce
c44495	it: so <i>is</i> Pharaoh king of Egypt to all
c44496	that trust in him.
c44497	But if thou say to
c44498	me, We trust in the LORD our God:
c44499	<i>is it</i> not he,
c44500	whose high places and whose altars Hezekiah hath taken away,
c44501	and said to Judah and to Jerusalem,
c44502	Ye shall worship before this altar?
c44503	Now
c44504	therefore give pledges, I pray thee, to my master the king of Assyria,
c44505	and I will give thee two thousand horses,
c44506	if thou be able
c44507	on thy part to set riders upon them.
c44508	How then wilt thou turn away the face of one captain of the least of my master's servants,
c44509	and put thy trust on Egypt for chariots and for horsemen?
c44510	And am I now
c44511	come up without the LORD against this land
c44512	to destroy
c44513	it? the LORD said unto
c44514	me, Go up against this land,
c44515	and destroy it.
c44516	Then said Eliakim and Shebna and Joah unto Rabshakeh,
c44517	Speak, I pray thee, unto thy servants in the Syrian language;
c44518	for we understand
c44519	<i>it:</i> and speak not to us in the Jews' language, in the ears of the people
c44520	that <i>are</i> on the wall.
c44521	But Rabshakeh said,
c44522	Hath my master sent me to thy master and to
c44523	thee to speak these words?
c44524	<i>hath he</i> not <i>sent me</i> to the men
c44525	that sit upon the wall,
c44526	that they may eat their own dung,
c44527	and drink their own piss with you?
c44528	Then Rabshakeh stood,
c44529	and cried with a loud voice in the Jews' language,
c44530	and said,
c44531	Hear ye the words of the great king, the king of Assyria.
c44532	Thus saith the king,
c44533	Let not Hezekiah deceive
c44534	you: for he shall not be able
c44535	to deliver you.
c44536	Neither let Hezekiah make you trust in the LORD,
c44537	saying,
c44538	The LORD will surely deliver
c44539	us: this city shall not be delivered into the hand of the king of Assyria.
c44540	Hearken not to Hezekiah:
c44541	for thus saith the king of Assyria,
c44542	Make <i>an agreement</i> with me <i>by</i> a present,
c44543	and come out to
c44544	me: and eat ye every one of his vine,
c44545	and every one of his fig tree,
c44546	and drink ye every one the waters of his own cistern;
c44547	Until I come
c44548	and take you away to a land like your own land, a land of corn and wine, a land of bread and vineyards.
c44549	<i>Beware</i> lest Hezekiah persuade
c44550	you, saying,
c44551	The LORD will deliver
c44553	us. Hath any of the gods of the nations delivered his land
c44554	out of the hand of the king of Assyria?
c44555	Where <i>are</i> the gods of Hamath and Arphad?
c44556	where <i>are</i> the gods of Sepharvaim?
c44557	and have they delivered Samaria out of my hand?
c44558	Who <i>are they</i> among all the gods of these lands,
c44559	that have delivered their land out of my hand,
c44560	that the LORD should deliver Jerusalem out of my hand?
c44561	But they held their peace,
c44562	and answered him not a word:
c44563	for the king's commandment
c44565	was, saying,
c44566	Answer him not.
c44567	Then came Eliakim, the son of Hilkiah,
c44568	that <i>was</i> over the household,
c44569	and Shebna the scribe, and Joah, the son of Asaph, the recorder, to Hezekiah with <i>their</i> clothes rent,
c44570	and told him the words of Rabshakeh.
c44571	And it came to pass,
c44572	when king Hezekiah heard
c44573	<i>it,</i> that he rent his clothes,
c44574	and covered himself with sackcloth,
c44575	and went into the house of the LORD.
c44576	And he sent Eliakim,
c44577	who <i>was</i> over the household,
c44578	and Shebna the scribe, and the elders of the priests
c44579	covered with sackcloth,
c44580	unto Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz.
c44581	And they said unto
c44582	him, Thus saith Hezekiah,
c44583	This day <i>is</i> a day of trouble, and of rebuke, and of blasphemy:
c44584	for the children are come to the birth,
c44585	and <i>there is</i> not strength to bring forth.
c44586	It may be the LORD thy God will hear the words of Rabshakeh,
c44587	whom the king of Assyria his master hath sent
c44588	to reproach the living God,
c44589	and will reprove the words
c44590	which the LORD thy God hath heard:
c44591	wherefore lift up <i>thy</i> prayer for the remnant that is left.
c44592	So the servants of king Hezekiah came to Isaiah.
c44593	And Isaiah said unto
c44594	them, Thus shall ye say unto your master,
c44595	Thus saith the LORD,
c44596	Be not afraid of the words
c44597	that thou hast heard,
c44598	wherewith the servants of the king of Assyria have blasphemed me.
c44599	Behold, I will send a blast
c44600	upon him, and he shall hear a rumour,
c44601	and return to his own land;
c44602	and I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land.
c44603	So Rabshakeh returned,
c44604	and found the king of Assyria
c44605	warring against Libnah:
c44606	for he had heard
c44607	that he was departed from Lachish.
c44608	And he heard say concerning Tirhakah king of Ethiopia,
c44610	He is come forth
c44611	to make war with
c44612	thee. And when he heard
c44613	<i>it,</i> he sent messengers to Hezekiah,
c44614	saying,
c44615	Thus shall ye speak to Hezekiah king of Judah,
c44616	saying,
c44617	Let not thy God, in whom thou trustest, deceive
c44619	thee, saying,
c44620	Jerusalem shall not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.
c44621	Behold, thou hast heard
c44622	what the kings of Assyria have done to all lands
c44623	by destroying them utterly;
c44624	and shalt thou be delivered?
c44625	Have the gods of the nations delivered
c44626	them which my fathers have destroyed,
c44627	<i>as</i> Gozan, and Haran, and Rezeph, and the children of Eden
c44628	which <i>were</i> in Telassar?
c44629	Where <i>is</i> the king of Hamath, and the king of Arphad, and the king of the city of Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivah?
c44630	And Hezekiah received the letter from the hand of the messengers,
c44631	and read
c44633	it: and Hezekiah went up unto the house of the LORD, and spread it before the LORD.
c44634	And Hezekiah prayed unto the LORD,
c44635	saying,
c44636	O LORD of hosts, God of Israel,
c44637	that dwellest <i>between</i> the cherubims,
c44638	thou <i>art</i> the God, <i>even</i> thou alone, of all the kingdoms of the earth:
c44639	thou hast made heaven and earth.
c44640	Incline
c44641	O LORD,
c44642	thine ear,
c44643	and hear;
c44644	open
c44645	O LORD,
c44646	thine eyes,
c44647	and see:
c44648	and hear all the words of Sennacherib,
c44649	which hath sent
c44650	to reproach the living God.
c44651	Of a truth, LORD,
c44652	the kings of Assyria have laid waste all the nations, and their countries,
c44653	And have cast their gods into the fire:
c44654	for they <i>were</i> no gods,
c44655	but the work of men's hands, wood and stone:
c44656	therefore they have destroyed them.
c44657	Now
c44658	therefore, O LORD our God,
c44659	save us from his hand,
c44660	that all the kingdoms of the earth may know
c44661	that thou <i>art</i> the LORD, <i>even</i> thou only.
c44662	Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent unto Hezekiah,
c44663	saying,
c44664	Thus saith the LORD God of Israel,
c44665	Whereas thou hast prayed to me against Sennacherib king of Assyria:
c44666	This <i>is</i> the word
c44667	which the LORD hath spoken concerning
c44669	him; The virgin, the daughter of Zion, hath despised thee, <i>and</i> laughed thee to scorn;
c44670	the daughter of Jerusalem hath shaken her head at thee.
c44671	Whom hast thou reproached
c44672	and blasphemed?
c44673	and against whom hast thou exalted <i>thy</i> voice,
c44674	and lifted up thine eyes on high?
c44675	<i>even</i> against the Holy One of Israel.
c44676	By thy servants hast thou reproached the Lord,
c44677	and hast said,
c44678	By the multitude of my chariots am I come up to the height of the mountains, to the sides of Lebanon;
c44679	and I will cut down the tall cedars thereof, <i>and</i> the choice fir trees
c44680	thereof: and I will enter into the height of his border, <i>and</i> the forest of his Carmel.
c44681	I have digged,
c44682	and drunk water;
c44683	and with the sole of my feet have I dried up all the rivers of the besieged places.
c44684	Hast thou not heard long ago,
c44685	<i>how</i> I have done it; <i>and</i> of ancient times,
c44686	that I have formed
c44687	it? now have I brought it to pass,
c44688	that thou shouldest be
c44689	to lay waste defenced cities <i>into</i> ruinous heaps.
c44690	Therefore their inhabitants <i>were</i> of small power,
c44691	they were dismayed
c44692	and confounded:
c44693	they were <i>as</i> the grass of the field, and <i>as</i> the green herb, <i>as</i> the grass on the housetops, and <i>as corn</i> blasted before it be grown up.
c44695	thy abode,
c44696	and thy going out,
c44697	and thy coming in,
c44698	But I know
c44700	and thy rage against me.
c44701	Because thy rage against
c44702	me, and thy tumult, is come up into mine ears,
c44703	therefore will I put my hook in thy nose,
c44704	and my bridle in thy lips,
c44705	and I will turn thee back by the way
c44706	by which thou camest.
c44707	And this <i>shall be</i> a sign
c44708	unto thee, Ye shall eat <i>this</i> year such as groweth of itself;
c44709	and the second year that which springeth of the same:
c44710	and in the third year sow
c44711	ye, and reap,
c44712	and plant vineyards,
c44713	and eat the fruit thereof.
c44714	And the remnant that is escaped of the house of Judah shall again take root downward,
c44715	and bear fruit upward:
c44716	For out of Jerusalem shall go forth a remnant,
c44717	and they that escape out of mount Zion:
c44718	the zeal of the LORD of hosts shall do this.
c44719	Therefore thus saith the LORD concerning the king of Assyria,
c44720	He shall not come into this city,
c44721	nor shoot an arrow there,
c44722	nor come before it with shields,
c44723	nor cast a bank against it.
c44724	By the way
c44725	that he came,
c44726	by the same shall he return,
c44727	and shall not come into this city,
c44728	saith the LORD.
c44729	For I will defend this city
c44730	to save it for mine own sake, and for my servant David's sake.
c44731	Then the angel of the LORD went forth,
c44732	and smote in the camp of the Assyrians a hundred and fourscore and five thousand:
c44733	and when they arose early in the morning,
c44734	behold, they <i>were</i> all dead corpses.
c44736	and went and returned,
c44737	So Sennacherib king of Assyria departed,
c44738	and dwelt at Nineveh.
c44739	And it came to pass,
c44740	as he was worshipping in the house of Nisroch his god,
c44741	that Adrammelech and Sharezer his sons smote him with the sword;
c44742	and they escaped into the land of Armenia:
c44743	and Esarhaddon his son reigned in his stead.
c44744	In those days was Hezekiah sick
c44745	unto death.
c44746	And Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz came unto
c44747	him, and said unto
c44748	him, Thus saith the LORD,
c44749	Set thine house in order:
c44750	for thou shalt die,
c44751	and not live.
c44752	Then Hezekiah turned his face toward the wall,
c44753	and prayed unto the LORD,
c44754	And said,
c44755	O LORD, I beseech thee,
c44756	Remember now,
c44757	how I have walked before thee in truth and with a perfect heart,
c44758	and have done <i>that which is</i> good in thy sight.
c44759	And Hezekiah wept sore.
c44760	Then came the word of the LORD to Isaiah,
c44761	saying,
c44762	Go,
c44763	and say to Hezekiah,
c44764	Thus saith the LORD, the God of David thy father,
c44765	I have heard thy prayer,
c44766	I have seen thy tears:
c44767	behold, I will add unto thy days fifteen years.
c44768	And I will deliver thee and this city out of the hand of the king of Assyria:
c44770	and I will defend this city.
c44771	And this <i>shall be</i> a sign unto thee from the LORD,
c44772	that the LORD will do this thing
c44773	that he hath spoken;
c44774	Behold, I will bring again the shadow of the degrees,
c44775	which is gone down in the sun dial of Ahaz,
c44776	ten degrees backward.
c44777	So the sun returned ten degrees, by which degrees
c44778	it was gone down.
c44779	The writing of Hezekiah king of Judah,
c44780	when he had been sick,
c44781	and was recovered of his sickness:
c44782	I said
c44783	in the cutting off of my days, I shall go to the gates of the grave:
c44784	I am deprived of the residue of my years.
c44785	I said,
c44786	I shall not see the LORD,
c44787	<i>even</i> the LORD, in the land of the living:
c44788	I shall behold man no more with the inhabitants of the world.
c44789	Mine age is departed,
c44790	and is removed from me as a shepherd's tent:
c44791	I have cut off like a weaver my life:
c44792	he will cut me off with pining sickness:
c44793	from day <i>even</i> to night wilt thou make an end of me.
c44794	I reckoned till morning,
c44795	<i>that,</i> as a lion,
c44796	so will he break all my bones:
c44797	from day <i>even</i> to night wilt thou make an end of me.
c44798	Like a crane <i>or</i> a swallow,
c44799	so did I chatter:
c44800	I did mourn as a dove:
c44801	mine eyes fail <i>with looking</i> upward:
c44802	O LORD,
c44803	I am oppressed;
c44804	undertake for me.
c44805	What shall I say?
c44806	he hath both spoken
c44807	unto me, and himself hath done
c44808	<i>it:</i> I shall go softly all my years in the bitterness of my soul.
c44809	O Lord,
c44810	by these <i>things men</i> live,
c44811	and in all these <i>things is</i> the life of my spirit:
c44812	so wilt thou recover
c44813	me, and make me to live.
c44814	Behold, for peace I had great bitterness:
c44815	but thou hast in love to my soul <i>delivered it</i> from the pit of corruption:
c44816	for thou hast cast all my sins behind thy back.
c44817	For the grave cannot praise
c44818	thee, death can <i>not</i> celebrate
c44819	thee: they that go down into the pit cannot hope for thy truth.
c44820	The living, the living,
c44821	he shall praise thee, as I <i>do</i> this day:
c44822	the father to the children shall make known thy truth.
c44823	The LORD
c44824	<i>was ready</i> to save
c44825	me: therefore we will sing my songs to the stringed instruments all the days of our life in the house of the LORD.
c44826	For Isaiah had said,
c44827	Let them take a lump of figs,
c44828	and lay <i>it</i> for a plaister upon the boil,
c44829	and he shall recover.
c44830	Hezekiah also had said,
c44831	What <i>is</i> the sign
c44832	that I shall go up to the house of the LORD?
c44833	At that time Merodachbaladan, the son of Baladan, king of Babylon, sent letters and a present to Hezekiah:
c44834	for he had heard
c44835	that he had been sick,
c44836	and was recovered.
c44837	And Hezekiah was glad of
c44838	them, and shewed them the house of his precious things, the silver, and the gold, and the spices, and the precious ointment, and all the house of his armour, and all
c44839	that was found in his treasures:
c44840	there was nothing
c44841	that Hezekiah shewed them not.
c44842	in his house, nor in all his dominion,
c44843	Then came Isaiah the prophet unto king Hezekiah,
c44844	and said unto
c44845	him, What said these men?
c44846	and from whence came they unto
c44847	thee? And Hezekiah said,
c44848	They are come from a far country unto me, <i>even</i> from Babylon.
c44849	Then said
c44850	he, What have they seen in thine house?
c44851	And Hezekiah answered,
c44852	All
c44853	that <i>is</i> in mine house
c44854	have they seen:
c44855	there is nothing
c44856	that I have not shewed them.
c44857	among my treasures
c44858	Then said Isaiah to Hezekiah,
c44859	Hear the word of the LORD of hosts:
c44860	Behold, the days come,
c44861	that all that <i>is</i> in thine house,
c44863	and <i>that</i> which thy fathers have laid up in store until this day, shall be carried
c44864	to Babylon:
c44865	nothing shall be left,
c44866	saith the LORD.
c44867	And of thy sons
c44868	that shall issue from
c44869	thee, which thou shalt beget,
c44870	shall they take away;
c44871	and they shall be eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon.
c44872	Then said Hezekiah to Isaiah,
c44873	Good <i>is</i> the word of the LORD
c44874	which thou hast spoken.
c44875	He said
c44876	moreover, For there shall be peace and truth in my days.
c44877	Comfort
c44878	ye, comfort ye my people,
c44879	saith your God.
c44880	Speak ye comfortably to Jerusalem,
c44881	and cry unto
c44882	her, that her warfare is accomplished,
c44883	that her iniquity is pardoned:
c44884	for she hath received of the LORD'S hand double for all her sins.
c44885	The voice of him that crieth
c44886	in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the LORD,
c44887	make straight in the desert a highway for our God.
c44888	Every valley shall be exalted,
c44889	and every mountain and hill shall be made low:
c44890	and the crooked shall be made straight,
c44891	and the rough places plain:
c44892	And the glory of the LORD shall be revealed,
c44893	and all flesh shall see <i>it</i> together:
c44894	for the mouth of the LORD hath spoken <i>it.</i>
c44895	The voice said,
c44896	Cry.
c44897	And he said,
c44898	What shall I cry?
c44899	All flesh <i>is</i> grass,
c44900	and all the goodliness thereof <i>is</i> as the flower of the field:
c44901	The grass withereth,
c44902	the flower fadeth:
c44903	because the spirit of the LORD bloweth
c44904	upon it: surely the people <i>is</i> grass.
c44905	The grass withereth,
c44906	the flower fadeth:
c44907	but the word of our God shall stand for ever.
c44908	get thee up into the high mountain;
c44909	O Zion, that bringest good tidings,
c44910	lift up thy voice with strength;
c44911	O Jerusalem, that bringest good tidings,
c44912	lift <i>it</i> up,
c44913	be not afraid;
c44914	say unto the cities of Judah,
c44915	Behold your God!
c44916	Behold, the Lord GOD will come with strong
c44917	<i>hand,</i> and his arm shall rule
c44918	for him: behold, his reward <i>is</i> with
c44919	him, and his work before him.
c44920	He shall feed his flock like a shepherd:
c44921	he shall gather the lambs with his arm,
c44922	and carry <i>them</i> in his bosom,
c44923	<i>and</i> shall gently lead those that are with young.
c44924	Who hath measured the waters in the hollow of his hand,
c44925	and meted out heaven with the span,
c44926	and comprehended the dust of the earth in a measure,
c44927	and weighed the mountains in scales,
c44928	and the hills in a balance?
c44929	Who hath directed the Spirit of the LORD,
c44930	or <i>being</i> his counsellor
c44931	hath taught him?
c44932	With whom took he counsel,
c44933	and <i>who</i> instructed
c44934	him, and taught him in the path of judgment,
c44935	and taught him knowledge,
c44936	and shewed to him the way of understanding?
c44937	Behold, the nations <i>are</i> as a drop of a bucket,
c44938	and are counted as the small dust of the balance:
c44939	behold, he taketh up the isles as a very little thing.
c44941	And Lebanon <i>is</i> not sufficient
c44942	to burn,
c44943	nor the beasts thereof sufficient for a burnt offering.
c44944	All nations before him <i>are</i> as nothing;
c44945	and they are counted to him less than nothing, and vanity.
c44946	To whom then will ye liken God?
c44947	or what likeness
c44948	will ye compare unto him?
c44949	The workman melteth a graven image,
c44950	and the goldsmith spreadeth it over with gold,
c44951	and casteth silver chains.
c44952	He that <i>is</i> so impoverished that he hath no oblation
c44953	a tree
c44954	<i>that</i> will not rot;
c44955	chooseth
c44956	he seeketh unto him a cunning workman
c44957	to prepare a graven image,
c44958	<i>that</i> shall not be moved.
c44959	Have ye not known?
c44960	have ye not heard?
c44961	hath it not been told you from the beginning?
c44962	have ye not understood from the foundations of the earth?
c44963	<i>It is</i> he that sitteth upon the circle of the earth,
c44964	and the inhabitants thereof <i>are</i> as grasshoppers;
c44965	that stretcheth out the heavens as a curtain,
c44966	and spreadeth them out as a tent
c44967	to dwell in:
c44968	That bringeth the princes to nothing;
c44969	he maketh the judges of the earth as vanity.
c44970	Yea, they shall not be planted;
c44971	yea, they shall not be sown:
c44972	yea, their stock shall not take root in the earth:
c44973	and he shall also blow
c44974	upon them, and they shall wither,
c44975	and the whirlwind shall take them away as stubble.
c44976	To whom then will ye liken
c44977	me, or shall I be equal?
c44978	saith the Holy One.
c44979	Lift up your eyes on high,
c44980	and behold
c44981	who hath created these
c44982	<i>things,</i> that bringeth out their host by number:
c44983	he calleth them all by names
c44984	by the greatness of his might, for that <i>he is</i> strong in power; not one faileth.
c44985	Why sayest
c44986	thou, O Jacob,
c44987	and speakest,
c44988	O Israel,
c44989	My way is hid from the LORD,
c44990	and my judgment is passed over from my God?
c44991	Hast thou not known?
c44992	hast thou not heard,
c44993	<i>that</i> the everlasting God, the LORD,
c44994	the Creator of the ends of the earth,
c44995	fainteth not,
c44996	neither is weary?
c44997	<i>there is</i> no searching of his understanding.
c44998	He giveth power to the faint;
c44999	and to <i>them that have</i> no might he increaseth strength.
c45000	Even the youths shall faint
c45001	and be weary,
c45002	and the young men shall utterly fall:
c45003	But they that wait upon the LORD shall renew <i>their</i> strength;
c45004	they shall mount up with wings as eagles;
c45005	they shall run,
c45006	and not be weary;
c45007	<i>and</i> they shall walk,
c45008	and not faint.
c45009	Keep silence before
c45010	me, O islands;
c45011	and let the people renew <i>their</i> strength:
c45012	let them come near;
c45013	then let them speak:
c45014	let us come near together to judgment.
c45015	Who raised up the righteous <i>man</i> from the east,
c45016	called him to his foot,
c45017	gave the nations before
c45018	him, and made <i>him</i> rule over kings?
c45019	he gave <i>them</i> as the dust to his sword,
c45020	<i>and</i> as driven stubble to his bow.
c45021	He pursued
c45022	them, <i>and</i> passed safely; <i>even</i> by the way
c45023	<i>that</i> he had not gone with his feet.
c45024	Who hath wrought
c45025	and done
c45026	<i>it,</i> calling the generations from the beginning?
c45027	I the LORD, the first,
c45028	and with the last; I <i>am</i> he.
c45029	The isles saw
c45030	<i>it,</i> and feared;
c45031	the ends of the earth were afraid,
c45032	drew near,
c45033	and came.
c45034	every one his neighbour;
c45035	They helped
c45036	and <i>every one</i> said to his brother,
c45037	Be of good courage.
c45038	So the carpenter encouraged the goldsmith,
c45039	<i>and</i> he that smootheth <i>with</i> the hammer him that smote the anvil,
c45040	saying, It <i>is</i> ready for the sodering:
c45042	and he fastened it with nails,
c45043	<i>that</i> it should not be moved.
c45044	But thou,
c45045	Israel, <i>art</i> my servant,
c45046	Jacob
c45047	whom I have chosen,
c45048	the seed of Abraham my friend.
c45049	<i>Thou</i> whom I have taken from the ends of the earth,
c45050	and called thee from the chief men
c45051	thereof, and said
c45052	unto thee, Thou <i>art</i> my servant;
c45053	I have chosen
c45054	thee, and not cast thee away.
c45055	Fear thou not;
c45056	for I <i>am</i> with
c45057	thee: be not dismayed;
c45058	for I <i>am</i> thy God:
c45059	I will strengthen
c45060	thee; yea, I will help
c45061	thee; yea, I will uphold thee with the right hand of my righteousness.
c45062	Behold, all
c45063	and confounded:
c45064	they that were incensed against thee shall be ashamed
c45065	they shall be as nothing;
c45066	and they that strive with thee shall perish.
c45067	Thou shalt seek
c45068	them, and shalt not find them, <i>even</i> them that contended
c45069	with thee: they that war against thee shall be as nothing, and as a thing of nought.
c45070	For I the LORD thy God
c45071	will hold thy right hand,
c45072	saying
c45073	unto thee, Fear not;
c45074	I will help thee.
c45075	Fear not,
c45076	thou worm Jacob,
c45077	<i>and</i> ye men of Israel;
c45078	I will help
c45079	thee, saith the LORD,
c45080	and thy redeemer, the Holy One of Israel.
c45081	Behold, I will make thee a new sharp threshing instrument having teeth:
c45082	thou shalt thresh the mountains,
c45083	and beat <i>them</i> small,
c45084	and shalt make the hills as chaff.
c45085	Thou shalt fan
c45086	them, and the wind shall carry them away,
c45087	and the whirlwind shall scatter
c45088	them: and thou shalt rejoice in the LORD,
c45089	<i>and</i> shalt glory in the Holy One of Israel.
c45090	<i>When</i> the poor and needy seek water,
c45091	and <i>there is</i> none,
c45092	<i>and</i> their tongue faileth for thirst,
c45093	I the LORD
c45094	will hear
c45095	them, I the God of Israel
c45096	will not forsake them.
c45097	I will open rivers in high places,
c45098	and fountains in the midst of the valleys:
c45099	I will make the wilderness a pool of water,
c45100	and the dry land springs of water.
c45101	I will plant in the wilderness the cedar, the shittah tree, and the myrtle, and the oil tree;
c45102	I will set in the desert the fir tree, <i>and</i> the pine, and the box tree together:
c45103	That they may see,
c45104	and know,
c45105	and consider,
c45106	and understand together,
c45107	that the hand of the LORD hath done this,
c45108	and the Holy One of Israel hath created it.
c45109	Produce your cause,
c45110	saith the LORD;
c45111	bring forth your strong
c45112	<i>reasons,</i> saith the King of Jacob.
c45113	Let them bring <i>them</i> forth,
c45114	and shew
c45115	us what shall happen:
c45116	the former things,
c45117	what they
c45118	let them shew
c45119	<i>be,</i> that we may consider
c45120	them, and know the latter end
c45121	of them; or declare us things for to come.
c45122	Shew
c45123	the things that are to come hereafter,
c45124	that we may know
c45125	that ye <i>are</i> gods:
c45126	yea, do good,
c45127	or do evil,
c45128	that we may be dismayed,
c45129	and behold <i>it</i> together.
c45130	Behold, ye <i>are</i> of nothing,
c45131	and your work of nought:
c45132	an abomination
c45133	<i>is he that</i> chooseth you.
c45134	I have raised up <i>one</i> from the north,
c45135	and he shall come:
c45136	from the rising of the sun shall he call upon my name:
c45137	and he shall come upon princes as <i>upon</i> morter,
c45138	and as the potter
c45139	treadeth clay.
c45140	Who hath declared from the beginning,
c45141	that we may know?
c45142	and beforetime,
c45143	that we may say,
c45144	<i>He is</i> righteous?
c45145	yea, <i>there is</i> none that sheweth,
c45146	yea, <i>there is</i> none that declareth,
c45147	yea, <i>there is</i> none that heareth your words.
c45148	The first <i>shall say</i> to Zion,
c45149	Behold, behold
c45151	them: and I will give to Jerusalem one that bringeth good tidings.
c45152	For I beheld,
c45153	and <i>there was</i> no man;
c45154	even among them,
c45155	and <i>there was</i> no counsellor,
c45156	that, when I asked
c45157	of them, could answer a word.
c45158	Behold, they <i>are</i> all vanity;
c45159	their works <i>are</i> nothing:
c45160	their molten images <i>are</i> wind and confusion.
c45161	Behold my servant,
c45162	whom I uphold;
c45163	mine elect,
c45164	<i>in whom</i> my soul delighteth;
c45165	I have put my spirit upon
c45166	him: he shall bring forth judgment to the Gentiles.
c45167	He shall not cry,
c45168	nor lift up,
c45169	nor cause his voice to be heard in the street.
c45170	A bruised reed shall he not break,
c45171	and the smoking flax
c45172	shall he not quench:
c45173	he shall bring forth judgment unto truth.
c45174	He shall not fail
c45175	nor be discouraged,
c45176	till he have set judgment in the earth:
c45177	and the isles shall wait for his law.
c45178	Thus saith God the LORD,
c45179	he that created the heavens,
c45180	and stretched them out;
c45181	he that spread forth the earth, and that which cometh out
c45182	of it; he that giveth breath unto the people upon
c45183	it, and spirit
c45184	to them that walk therein:
c45185	I the LORD have called thee in righteousness,
c45186	and will hold thine hand,
c45187	and will keep
c45188	thee, and give thee for a covenant of the people, for a light of the Gentiles;
c45189	To open the blind eyes,
c45190	to bring out the prisoners from the prison,
c45191	<i>and</i> them that sit in darkness out of the prison house.
c45192	I <i>am</i> the LORD:
c45193	that <i>is</i> my name:
c45194	and my glory will I not give to another,
c45195	neither my praise to graven images.
c45197	Behold, the former things are come to pass,
c45198	and new things do I declare:
c45199	before they spring forth
c45200	I tell you of them.
c45201	Sing unto the LORD a new song,
c45202	<i>and</i> his praise from the end of the earth,
c45203	ye that go down to the sea, and all that is therein;
c45204	the isles, and the inhabitants thereof.
c45205	Let the wilderness and the cities thereof lift up <i>their voice,</i> the villages
c45206	<i>that</i> Kedar doth inhabit:
c45207	let the inhabitants of the rock sing,
c45208	let them shout from the top of the mountains.
c45209	Let them give glory unto the LORD,
c45210	and declare his praise in the islands.
c45211	The LORD shall go forth as a mighty man,
c45212	he shall stir up jealousy like a man of war:
c45213	he shall cry,
c45214	yea, roar;
c45215	he shall prevail against his enemies.
c45216	I have long time holden my peace;
c45217	I have been still,
c45218	<i>and</i> refrained myself:
c45219	<i>now</i> will I cry like a travailing woman;
c45220	I will destroy
c45221	and devour at once.
c45222	I will make waste mountains and hills,
c45223	and dry up all their herbs;
c45224	and I will make the rivers islands,
c45225	and I will dry up the pools.
c45226	And I will bring the blind by a way
c45227	<i>that</i> they knew not;
c45228	in paths
c45229	<i>that</i> they have not known:
c45230	I will lead them
c45231	I will make darkness light before
c45232	them, and crooked things straight.
c45233	These things
c45234	will I do
c45235	unto them, and not forsake them.
c45236	They shall be turned back,
c45237	they shall be greatly ashamed,
c45238	that trust in graven images,
c45239	that say to the molten images,
c45240	Ye <i>are</i> our gods.
c45241	ye deaf;
c45242	Hear,
c45244	ye blind,
c45245	and look,
c45246	that ye may see.
c45247	Who <i>is</i> blind,
c45248	but my servant?
c45249	or deaf, as my messenger
c45250	<i>that</i> I sent?
c45251	who <i>is</i> blind as <i>he that is</i> perfect,
c45252	and blind as the LORD'S servant?
c45253	Seeing many things,
c45254	but thou observest not;
c45255	opening the ears,
c45256	but he heareth not.
c45257	The LORD is well pleased for his righteousness' sake;
c45258	he will magnify the law,
c45259	and make <i>it</i> honourable.
c45260	But this <i>is</i> a people robbed and spoiled;
c45261	<i>they are</i> all of them snared in holes,
c45262	and they are hid in prison houses:
c45263	they are for a prey,
c45264	and none delivereth;
c45265	for a spoil,
c45266	and none saith,
c45267	Restore.
c45268	Who among you will give ear to this?
c45269	<i>who</i> will hearken
c45270	and hear for the time to come?
c45271	Who gave Jacob for a spoil,
c45272	and Israel to the robbers?
c45273	did not the LORD,
c45274	he against whom we have sinned?
c45275	for they would not
c45276	walk in his ways,
c45277	neither were they obedient unto his law.
c45278	Therefore he hath poured upon him the fury of his anger, and the strength of battle:
c45279	and it hath set him on fire round about,
c45280	yet he knew not;
c45281	and it burned
c45282	him, yet he laid <i>it</i> not to heart.
c45283	But now thus saith the LORD that created
c45284	thee, O Jacob,
c45285	and he that formed
c45286	thee, O Israel,
c45287	Fear not:
c45288	for I have redeemed
c45289	thee, I have called <i>thee</i> by thy name;
c45290	thou <i>art</i> mine.
c45291	When thou passest through the waters,
c45292	I <i>will be</i> with
c45293	thee; and through the rivers,
c45294	they shall not overflow
c45295	thee: when thou walkest through the fire,
c45296	thou shalt not be burned;
c45297	neither shall the flame kindle upon thee.
c45298	For I <i>am</i> the LORD thy God, the Holy One of Israel, thy Saviour:
c45299	I gave Egypt <i>for</i> thy ransom,
c45300	Ethiopia and Seba for thee.
c45301	Since thou wast precious in my sight,
c45302	thou hast been honourable,
c45303	and I have loved
c45304	thee: therefore will I give men for
c45305	thee, and people for thy life.
c45306	Fear not:
c45307	for I <i>am</i> with
c45308	thee: I will bring thy seed from the east,
c45309	and gather thee from the west;
c45310	I will say to the north,
c45311	Give up;
c45312	and to the south,
c45313	Keep not back:
c45314	bring my sons from far,
c45315	and my daughters from the ends of the earth;
c45316	<i>Even</i> every one
c45317	that is called by my name:
c45318	for I have created him for my glory,
c45319	I have formed
c45320	him; yea, I have made him.
c45321	Bring forth the blind people
c45322	that have eyes,
c45323	and the deaf
c45324	that have ears.
c45325	Let all the nations be gathered together,
c45326	and let the people be assembled:
c45327	who among them can declare this,
c45328	and shew us former things?
c45329	let them bring forth their witnesses,
c45330	that they may be justified:
c45331	or let them hear,
c45332	and say,
c45333	<i>It is</i> truth.
c45334	Ye <i>are</i> my witnesses,
c45335	saith the LORD,
c45336	and my servant
c45337	whom I have chosen:
c45338	that ye may know
c45339	and believe
c45340	me, and understand
c45341	that I <i>am</i> he:
c45342	before me there was no God formed,
c45343	neither shall there be after me.
c45344	I,
c45345	<i>even</i> I, <i>am</i> the LORD;
c45346	and beside me <i>there is</i> no saviour.
c45347	I have declared,
c45348	and have saved,
c45349	and I have shewed,
c45350	when <i>there was</i> no strange
c45351	<i>god</i> among you: therefore ye <i>are</i> my witnesses,
c45352	saith the LORD,
c45353	that I <i>am</i> God.
c45354	Yea, before the day <i>was</i> I <i>am</i> he;
c45355	and <i>there is</i> none that can deliver out of my hand:
c45356	I will work,
c45357	and who shall let it?
c45358	Thus saith the LORD, your redeemer, the Holy One of Israel;
c45359	For your sake I have sent to Babylon,
c45360	and have brought down all their nobles,
c45361	and the Chaldeans, whose cry <i>is</i> in the ships.
c45362	I <i>am</i> the LORD, your Holy One, the creator of Israel, your King.
c45363	Thus saith the LORD,
c45364	which maketh a way in the sea,
c45365	and a path in the mighty waters;
c45366	Which bringeth forth the chariot and horse, the army and the power;
c45367	they shall lie down together,
c45368	they shall not rise:
c45369	they are extinct,
c45370	they are quenched as tow.
c45371	Remember ye not the former things,
c45372	neither consider the things of old.
c45373	Behold, I will do a new thing;
c45374	now it shall spring forth;
c45375	shall ye not know
c45376	it? I will even make a way in the wilderness,
c45377	<i>and</i> rivers in the desert.
c45378	The beast of the field shall honour me, the dragons and the owls:
c45379	because I give waters in the wilderness,
c45380	<i>and</i> rivers in the desert,
c45381	to give drink to my people, my chosen.
c45383	This people have I formed
c45384	for myself; they shall shew forth my praise.
c45385	But thou hast not called upon
c45386	me, O Jacob;
c45387	but thou hast been weary
c45388	of me, O Israel.
c45389	Thou hast not brought me the small cattle of thy burnt offerings;
c45390	neither hast thou honoured me with thy sacrifices.
c45391	I have not caused thee to serve with an offering,
c45392	nor wearied thee with incense.
c45393	Thou hast bought me no sweet cane with money,
c45394	neither hast thou filled me with the fat of thy sacrifices:
c45395	but thou hast made me to serve with thy sins,
c45396	thou hast wearied me with thine iniquities.
c45397	I,
c45398	<i>even</i> I, <i>am</i> he
c45399	that blotteth out thy transgressions for mine own sake,
c45400	and will not remember thy sins.
c45401	Put me in remembrance:
c45402	let us plead together:
c45403	declare thou,
c45404	that thou mayest be justified.
c45405	Thy first father hath sinned,
c45406	and thy teachers have transgressed against me.
c45407	Therefore I have profaned the princes of the sanctuary,
c45408	and have given Jacob to the curse,
c45409	and Israel to reproaches.
c45410	Yet now hear,
c45411	O Jacob my servant;
c45412	and Israel,
c45413	whom I have chosen:
c45414	Thus saith the LORD that made thee, and formed thee from the womb,
c45415	<i>which</i> will help
c45416	thee; Fear not,
c45417	O Jacob, my servant;
c45418	and thou, Jesurun,
c45419	whom I have chosen.
c45420	For I will pour water upon him that is thirsty,
c45421	and floods upon the dry ground:
c45422	I will pour my spirit upon thy seed,
c45423	and my blessing upon thine offspring:
c45424	And they shall spring up <i>as</i> among the grass, as willows by the water courses.
c45425	One shall say,
c45426	I <i>am</i> the LORD'S;
c45427	and another shall call <i>himself</i> by the name of Jacob;
c45428	and another shall subscribe <i>with</i> his hand unto the LORD,
c45429	and surname <i>himself</i> by the name of Israel.
c45430	Thus saith the LORD the King of Israel, and his redeemer the LORD of hosts;
c45431	I <i>am</i> the first,
c45432	and I <i>am</i> the last;
c45433	and beside me <i>there is</i> no God.
c45434	And who,
c45435	as I, shall call,
c45436	and shall declare
c45437	it, and set it in order
c45438	for me, since I appointed the ancient people?
c45439	and the things that are coming,
c45440	and shall come,
c45441	let them shew unto them.
c45442	Fear ye not,
c45443	neither be afraid:
c45444	have not I told thee from that time,
c45445	and have declared
c45446	<i>it?</i> ye <i>are</i> even my witnesses.
c45447	Is there a God beside
c45448	me? yea, <i>there is</i> no God;
c45449	I know not <i>any.</i>
c45450	They that make a graven image
c45451	<i>are</i> all of them vanity;
c45452	and their delectable things shall not profit;
c45453	and they <i>are</i> their own witnesses;
c45454	they see not,
c45455	nor know;
c45456	that they may be ashamed.
c45457	Who hath formed a god,
c45458	or molten a graven image
c45459	<i>that</i> is profitable for nothing?
c45460	Behold, all his fellows shall be ashamed:
c45461	and the workmen,
c45462	they <i>are</i> of men:
c45463	let them all be gathered together,
c45464	let them stand up;
c45465	<i>yet</i> they shall fear,
c45466	<i>and</i> they shall be ashamed together.
c45467	The smith with the tongs
c45468	both worketh in the coals,
c45469	and fashioneth it with hammers,
c45470	and worketh it with the strength of his arms:
c45471	yea, he is hungry,
c45472	and his strength faileth:
c45473	he drinketh no water,
c45474	and is faint.
c45475	The carpenter stretcheth out <i>his</i> rule;
c45476	he marketh it out with a line;
c45477	he fitteth it with planes,
c45478	and he marketh it out with the compass,
c45479	and maketh it after the figure of a man, according to the beauty of a man;
c45480	that it may remain in the house.
c45481	He heweth him down cedars,
c45482	and taketh the cypress and the oak,
c45483	which he strengtheneth for himself among the trees of the forest:
c45484	he planteth an ash,
c45485	and the rain doth nourish <i>it.</i>
c45486	Then shall it be for a man
c45487	to burn:
c45488	for he will take thereof,
c45489	and warm
c45490	himself; yea, he kindleth
c45491	<i>it,</i> and baketh bread;
c45492	yea, he maketh a god,
c45493	and worshippeth
c45494	<i>it;</i> he maketh it a graven image,
c45495	and falleth down thereto.
c45496	He burneth part thereof in the fire; with part
c45497	thereof he eateth flesh;
c45498	he roasteth roast,
c45499	and is satisfied:
c45500	yea, he warmeth
c45501	<i>himself,</i> and saith,
c45502	Aha, I am warm,
c45503	I have seen the fire:
c45504	And the residue thereof he maketh a god, <i>even</i> his graven image:
c45505	he falleth down
c45506	unto it, and worshippeth
c45507	<i>it,</i> and prayeth unto
c45508	it, and saith,
c45509	Deliver
c45510	me; for thou <i>art</i> my god.
c45511	They have not known
c45512	nor understood:
c45513	for he hath shut
c45514	their eyes, that they cannot see;
c45515	<i>and</i> their hearts, that they cannot understand.
c45516	And none considereth in his heart,
c45517	neither <i>is there</i> knowledge
c45518	nor understanding
c45519	to say,
c45520	I have burned part of it in the fire;
c45521	yea, also I have baked bread upon the coals
c45522	thereof; I have roasted flesh,
c45523	and eaten
c45524	<i>it:</i> and shall I make the residue thereof an abomination?
c45525	shall I fall down to the stock of a tree?
c45526	He feedeth on ashes:
c45527	heart
c45528	a deceived
c45529	hath turned him aside,
c45530	that he cannot deliver his soul,
c45531	nor say,
c45532	<i>Is there</i> not a lie in my right hand?
c45533	Remember these,
c45534	O Jacob
c45535	and Israel;
c45536	for thou <i>art</i> my servant:
c45537	I have formed
c45538	thee; thou <i>art</i> my servant:
c45539	O Israel,
c45540	thou shalt not be forgotten of me.
c45541	I have blotted out, as a thick cloud, thy transgressions,
c45542	and, as a cloud, thy sins:
c45543	return unto
c45544	me; for I have redeemed thee.
c45545	Sing,
c45546	O ye heavens;
c45547	for the LORD hath done
c45548	<i>it:</i> shout,
c45549	ye lower parts of the earth:
c45550	break forth
c45551	ye mountains,
c45552	into singing,
c45553	O forest, and every tree
c45554	therein: for the LORD hath redeemed Jacob,
c45555	and glorified himself in Israel.
c45556	Thus saith the LORD, thy redeemer, and he that formed thee from the womb,
c45557	I <i>am</i> the LORD
c45558	that maketh all
c45559	<i>things;</i> that stretcheth forth the heavens alone;
c45560	that spreadeth abroad the earth by myself;
c45561	That frustrateth the tokens of the liars,
c45562	and maketh diviners mad;
c45563	that turneth wise <i>men</i> backward,
c45564	and maketh their knowledge foolish;
c45565	That confirmeth the word of his servant,
c45566	and performeth the counsel of his messengers;
c45567	that saith to Jerusalem,
c45568	Thou shalt be inhabited;
c45569	and to the cities of Judah,
c45570	Ye shall be built,
c45571	and I will raise up the decayed places thereof:
c45572	That saith to the deep,
c45573	Be dry,
c45574	and I will dry up thy rivers:
c45575	That saith of Cyrus,
c45576	<i>He is</i> my shepherd,
c45577	and shall perform all my pleasure:
c45578	even saying to Jerusalem,
c45579	Thou shalt be built;
c45580	and to the temple, Thy foundation shall be laid.
c45581	Thus saith the LORD to his anointed, to Cyrus,
c45582	whose right hand I have holden,
c45583	to subdue nations before
c45584	him; and I will loose the loins of kings,
c45585	to open before him the two leaved gates;
c45586	and the gates shall not be shut;
c45587	I will go before
c45588	thee, and make the crooked places straight:
c45589	I will break in pieces the gates of brass,
c45590	and cut in sunder the bars of iron:
c45591	And I will give thee the treasures of darkness, and hidden riches of secret places,
c45592	that thou mayest know
c45593	that I, the LORD,
c45594	which call <i>thee</i> by thy name,
c45595	<i>am</i> the God of Israel.
c45596	For Jacob my servant's sake, and Israel mine elect,
c45597	I have even called thee by thy name:
c45598	I have surnamed
c45599	thee, though thou hast not known me.
c45600	I <i>am</i> the LORD,
c45601	and <i>there is</i> none else,
c45602	<i>there is</i> no God beside
c45603	me: I girded
c45604	thee, though thou hast not known me:
c45605	That they may know from the rising of the sun, and from the west,
c45606	that <i>there is</i> none beside
c45607	me. I <i>am</i> the LORD,
c45608	and <i>there is</i> none else.
c45609	I form the light,
c45610	and create darkness:
c45611	I make peace,
c45612	and create evil:
c45613	I the LORD
c45614	do all these <i>things.</i>
c45615	Drop down,
c45616	ye heavens, from above,
c45617	and let the skies pour down righteousness:
c45618	let the earth open,
c45619	and let them bring forth salvation,
c45620	and let righteousness spring up together;
c45621	I the LORD have created it.
c45622	Woe
c45623	unto him that striveth with his Maker!
c45624	<i>Let</i> the potsherd <i>strive</i> with the potsherds of the earth.
c45625	Shall the clay say to him that fashioneth
c45626	it, What makest
c45627	thou? or thy work,
c45628	He hath no hands?
c45629	Woe
c45630	unto him that saith unto <i>his</i> father,
c45631	What begettest
c45632	thou? or to the woman,
c45633	What hast thou brought forth?
c45634	Thus saith the LORD, the Holy One of Israel, and his Maker,
c45635	Ask me of things to come
c45636	concerning my sons, and concerning the work of my hands command ye me.
c45637	I have made the earth,
c45638	and created man upon
c45639	it: I,
c45640	<i>even</i> my hands, have stretched out the heavens,
c45641	and all their host have I commanded.
c45642	I have raised him up in righteousness,
c45643	and I will direct all his ways:
c45644	he shall build my city,
c45645	and he shall let go my captives,
c45646	not for price
c45647	nor reward,
c45648	saith the LORD of hosts.
c45649	Thus saith the LORD,
c45650	The labour of Egypt, and merchandise of Ethiopia and of the Sabeans, men of stature, shall come over unto
c45651	thee, and they shall be
c45652	thine: they shall come after
c45653	thee; in chains they shall come over,
c45654	and they shall fall down unto
c45655	thee, they shall make supplication unto
c45656	thee, <i>saying,</i> Surely God
c45657	<i>is</i> in thee; and <i>there is</i> none else,
c45658	<i>there is</i> no God.
c45659	Verily thou <i>art</i> a God
c45660	that hidest thyself,
c45661	O God of Israel,
c45662	the Saviour.
c45663	They shall be ashamed,
c45664	and also confounded, all
c45665	of them: they shall go to confusion together <i>that are</i> makers of idols.
c45666	<i>But</i> Israel shall be saved in the LORD with an everlasting salvation:
c45667	ye shall not be ashamed
c45668	nor confounded world without end.
c45669	For thus saith the LORD
c45670	that created the heavens;
c45671	God himself
c45672	that formed the earth
c45673	and made
c45674	it; he hath established
c45675	it, he created it not in vain,
c45676	it to be inhabited:
c45677	he formed
c45678	I <i>am</i> the LORD;
c45679	and <i>there is</i> none else.
c45680	I have not spoken in secret, in a dark place of the earth:
c45681	I said not unto the seed of Jacob,
c45682	Seek ye me in vain:
c45683	I the LORD
c45684	speak righteousness,
c45685	I declare things that are right.
c45686	Assemble yourselves
c45687	and come;
c45688	draw near together,
c45689	ye <i>that are</i> escaped of the nations:
c45690	they have no knowledge
c45691	that set up the wood of their graven image,
c45692	and pray unto a god
c45693	<i>that</i> cannot save.
c45694	Tell
c45695	ye, and bring <i>them</i> near;
c45696	yea, let them take counsel together:
c45697	who hath declared this from ancient time?
c45698	<i>who</i> hath told it from that time?
c45699	<i>have</i> not I the LORD?
c45700	and <i>there is</i> no God else beside
c45701	me; a just God and a Saviour;
c45702	<i>there is</i> none beside me.
c45703	Look unto
c45704	me, and be ye saved,
c45705	all the ends of the earth:
c45706	for I <i>am</i> God,
c45707	and <i>there is</i> none else.
c45708	I have sworn
c45709	by myself, the word is gone out of my mouth <i>in</i> righteousness,
c45710	and shall not return,
c45711	That unto me every knee shall bow,
c45712	every tongue shall swear.
c45713	Surely, shall <i>one</i> say, in the LORD
c45715	have I righteousness and strength:
c45716	<i>even</i> to him shall <i>men</i> come;
c45717	and all that are incensed against him shall be ashamed.
c45719	In the LORD shall all the seed of Israel be justified,
c45720	and shall glory.
c45721	Bel boweth down,
c45722	Nebo stoopeth,
c45723	their idols were upon the beasts, and upon the cattle:
c45724	your carriages <i>were</i> heavy loaden; <i>they are</i> a burden to the weary <i>beast.</i>
c45725	They stoop,
c45726	they bow down together;
c45727	they could not
c45728	deliver the burden,
c45729	but themselves are gone into captivity.
c45730	Hearken unto
c45731	me, O house of Jacob,
c45732	and all the remnant of the house of Israel,
c45733	which are borne <i>by me</i> from the belly,
c45734	which are carried from the womb:
c45735	And <i>even</i> to <i>your</i> old age I <i>am</i> he;
c45736	and <i>even</i> to hoar hairs will I carry
c45737	<i>you:</i> I have made,
c45738	and I will bear;
c45739	even I will carry,
c45740	and will deliver <i>you.</i>
c45741	To whom will ye liken
c45742	me, and make <i>me</i> equal,
c45743	and compare
c45744	me, that we may be like?
c45745	They lavish gold out of the bag,
c45746	and weigh silver in the balance,
c45747	<i>and</i> hire a goldsmith;
c45748	and he maketh it a god:
c45749	they fall down,
c45750	yea, they worship.
c45751	They bear
c45752	him upon the shoulder, they carry
c45753	him, and set him in his place,
c45754	and he standeth;
c45755	from his place shall he not remove:
c45756	yea, <i>one</i> shall cry unto
c45757	him, yet can he not answer,
c45758	nor save him out of his trouble.
c45759	Remember this,
c45760	and shew yourselves men:
c45761	bring <i>it</i> again
c45762	O ye transgressors.
c45763	to mind,
c45764	Remember the former things of old:
c45765	for I <i>am</i> God,
c45766	and <i>there is</i> none else; <i>I am</i> God,
c45767	and <i>there is</i> none like me,
c45768	Declaring the end from the beginning,
c45769	and from ancient times
c45770	<i>the things</i> that are not <i>yet</i> done,
c45771	saying,
c45772	My counsel shall stand,
c45773	and I will do all my pleasure:
c45774	Calling a ravenous bird from the east,
c45775	the man that executeth my counsel from a far country:
c45776	yea, I have spoken
c45777	<i>it,</i> I will also bring it to pass;
c45778	I have purposed
c45779	<i>it,</i> I will also do it.
c45780	Hearken unto
c45781	me, ye stouthearted,
c45782	that <i>are</i> far from righteousness:
c45783	I bring near my righteousness;
c45784	it shall not be far off,
c45785	and my salvation shall not tarry:
c45786	and I will place salvation in Zion for Israel my glory.
c45787	Come down,
c45788	and sit in the dust,
c45789	O virgin daughter of Babylon,
c45790	sit on the ground:
c45791	<i>there is</i> no throne,
c45792	O daughter of the Chaldeans:
c45793	for thou shalt no more
c45794	be called tender and delicate.
c45795	Take the millstones,
c45796	and grind meal:
c45797	uncover thy locks,
c45798	make bare the leg,
c45799	uncover the thigh,
c45800	pass over the rivers.
c45801	Thy nakedness shall be uncovered,
c45802	yea, thy shame shall be seen:
c45803	I will take vengeance,
c45804	and I will not meet <i>thee as</i> a man.
c45805	<i>As for</i> our redeemer,
c45806	the LORD of hosts <i>is</i> his name,
c45807	the Holy One of Israel.
c45808	Sit thou silent,
c45809	and get thee into darkness,
c45810	O daughter of the Chaldeans:
c45811	for thou shalt no more
c45812	be called, The lady of kingdoms.
c45813	I was wroth with my people,
c45814	I have polluted mine inheritance,
c45815	and given them into thine hand:
c45816	thou didst shew them no mercy;
c45817	upon the ancient hast thou very heavily laid thy yoke.
c45818	And thou saidst,
c45819	I shall be a lady for ever:
c45820	<i>so</i> that thou didst not lay these <i>things</i> to thy heart,
c45821	neither didst remember the latter end of it.
c45823	Therefore hear now this,
c45824	<i>thou that art</i> given to pleasures,
c45825	that dwellest carelessly,
c45826	that sayest in thine heart,
c45827	I
c45828	<i>am,</i> and none else beside
c45829	me; I shall not sit <i>as</i> a widow,
c45830	neither shall I know the loss of children:
c45831	But these two <i>things</i> shall come to thee in a moment in one day, the loss of children, and widowhood:
c45832	they shall come upon thee in their perfection for the multitude of thy sorceries, <i>and</i> for the great abundance of thine enchantments.
c45833	For thou hast trusted in thy wickedness:
c45834	thou hast said,
c45835	None seeth
c45836	me. Thy wisdom and thy knowledge,
c45837	it hath perverted
c45838	thee; and thou hast said in thine heart,
c45839	I
c45840	<i>am,</i> and none else beside me.
c45841	Therefore shall evil come upon
c45842	thee; thou shalt not know
c45843	from whence it riseth:
c45844	and mischief shall fall upon
c45845	thee; thou shalt not be able
c45846	to put it off:
c45847	and desolation shall come upon thee suddenly,
c45848	<i>which</i> thou shalt not know.
c45849	Stand now with thine enchantments, and with the multitude of thy sorceries,
c45850	wherein thou hast laboured from thy youth;
c45851	if so be thou shalt be able
c45852	to profit,
c45853	if so be thou mayest prevail.
c45854	Thou art wearied in the multitude of thy counsels.
c45855	Let now the astrologers,
c45856	and save
c45858	the stargazers,
c45859	the monthly prognosticators, stand up,
c45860	thee from <i>these things</i> that shall come upon thee.
c45861	Behold, they shall be as stubble;
c45862	the fire shall burn
c45863	them; they shall not deliver themselves from the power of the flame:
c45864	<i>there shall</i> not <i>be</i> a coal
c45865	to warm
c45866	at, <i>nor</i> fire
c45867	to sit before it.
c45868	Thus shall they be
c45869	unto thee with whom thou hast laboured,
c45870	<i>even</i> thy merchants, from thy youth:
c45871	every one to his quarter;
c45872	they shall wander
c45873	none shall save thee.
c45874	Hear ye this,
c45875	O house of Jacob,
c45876	which are called by the name of Israel,
c45877	and are come forth out of the waters of Judah,
c45878	which swear by the name of the LORD,
c45879	and make mention of the God of Israel,
c45880	<i>but</i> not in truth,
c45881	nor in righteousness.
c45882	For they call themselves of the holy city,
c45883	and stay themselves upon the God of Israel;
c45884	The LORD of hosts <i>is</i> his name.
c45885	I have declared the former things from the beginning;
c45886	and they went forth out of my mouth,
c45887	and I shewed
c45888	them; I did <i>them</i> suddenly,
c45889	and they came to pass.
c45890	Because I knew
c45891	that thou <i>art</i> obstinate,
c45892	and thy neck <i>is</i> an iron sinew,
c45893	and thy brow brass;
c45894	I have even from the beginning declared
c45895	<i>it</i> to thee; before it came to pass
c45896	I shewed
c45897	<i>it</i> thee: lest thou shouldest say,
c45898	Mine idol hath done
c45899	them, and my graven image, and my molten image, hath commanded them.
c45900	Thou hast heard,
c45901	see all
c45903	this; and will not ye declare
c45904	<i>it?</i> I have shewed thee new things from this time,
c45905	even hidden things,
c45906	and thou didst not know them.
c45907	They are created now,
c45908	and not from the beginning; even before the day
c45909	when thou heardest them not;
c45910	lest thou shouldest say,
c45911	Behold, I knew them.
c45912	Yea, thou heardest not;
c45913	yea, thou knewest not;
c45914	yea, from that time <i>that</i> thine ear was not opened:
c45915	for I knew
c45916	that thou wouldest deal very treacherously,
c45919	and wast called a transgressor from the womb.
c45920	For my name's sake will I defer mine anger,
c45921	and for my praise will I refrain
c45922	for thee, that I cut thee not off.
c45923	Behold, I have refined
c45924	thee, but not with silver;
c45925	I have chosen thee in the furnace of affliction.
c45926	For mine own sake,
c45927	<i>even</i> for mine own sake, will I do
c45928	<i>it:</i> for how should <i>my name</i> be polluted?
c45929	and I will not give my glory unto another.
c45930	Hearken unto
c45931	me, O Jacob
c45932	and Israel, my called;
c45933	I <i>am</i> he;
c45934	I <i>am</i> the first,
c45935	I also <i>am</i> the last.
c45936	Mine hand also hath laid the foundation of the earth,
c45937	and my right hand hath spanned the heavens:
c45938	<i>when</i> I call unto
c45939	them, they stand up together.
c45940	ye, assemble yourselves,
c45941	All
c45942	and hear;
c45943	which among them hath declared these
c45944	<i>things?</i> The LORD hath loved
c45945	him: he will do his pleasure on Babylon,
c45946	and his arm <i>shall be on</i> the Chaldeans.
c45947	I,
c45948	<i>even</i> I, have spoken;
c45949	yea, I have called
c45950	him: I have brought
c45951	him, and he shall make his way prosperous.
c45952	Come ye near unto
c45953	me, hear ye this;
c45954	I have not spoken in secret from the beginning;
c45955	from the time
c45956	that it was,
c45957	there <i>am</i> I:
c45958	and now the Lord GOD, and his Spirit, hath sent me.
c45959	Thus saith the LORD, thy Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel;
c45960	I <i>am</i> the LORD thy God
c45961	which teacheth
c45962	thee to profit,
c45963	which leadeth thee by the way
c45964	<i>that</i> thou shouldest go.
c45965	O that thou hadst hearkened to my commandments!
c45966	then had thy peace been as a river,
c45967	and thy righteousness as the waves of the sea:
c45968	Thy seed also had been as the sand,
c45969	and the offspring of thy bowels like the gravel
c45971	thereof; his name should not have been cut off nor destroyed from before me.
c45972	Go ye forth of Babylon,
c45973	flee ye from the Chaldeans,
c45974	with a voice of singing declare
c45975	ye, tell this,
c45976	utter it <i>even</i> to the end of the earth;
c45977	say
c45978	ye, The LORD hath redeemed his servant Jacob.
c45979	And they thirsted not <i>when</i> he led them through the deserts:
c45981	he caused the waters to flow out of the rock
c45982	for them: he clave the rock
c45983	also, and the waters gushed out.
c45984	<i>There is</i> no peace,
c45985	saith the LORD,
c45986	unto the wicked.
c45987	Listen,
c45988	O isles,
c45989	unto
c45990	me; and hearken,
c45991	ye people, from far;
c45992	The LORD hath called me from the womb;
c45993	from the bowels of my mother hath he made mention of my name.
c45994	And he hath made my mouth like a sharp sword;
c45995	in the shadow of his hand hath he hid
c45996	me, and made me a polished shaft;
c45997	in his quiver hath he hid me;
c45998	And said
c45999	unto me, Thou <i>art</i> my servant,
c46000	O Israel,
c46001	in whom I will be glorified.
c46002	Then I said,
c46003	I have laboured in vain,
c46004	I have spent my strength for nought, and in vain:
c46005	<i>yet</i> surely my judgment <i>is</i> with the LORD,
c46006	and my work with my God.
c46007	And now, saith the LORD
c46008	that formed me from the womb <i>to be</i> his servant,
c46009	to bring Jacob again to
c46010	him, Though Israel be not gathered,
c46011	yet shall I be glorious in the eyes of the LORD,
c46012	and my God shall be my strength.
c46013	And he said,
c46014	It is a light thing
c46015	that thou shouldest be my servant
c46016	to raise up the tribes of Jacob,
c46017	and to restore the preserved of Israel:
c46018	I will also give thee for a light to the Gentiles,
c46019	that thou mayest be my salvation unto the end of the earth.
c46020	Thus saith the LORD,
c46021	the Redeemer of Israel, <i>and</i> his Holy One,
c46022	to him whom man despiseth,
c46023	to him whom the nation abhorreth, to a servant of rulers,
c46024	Kings shall see
c46025	and arise, princes
c46026	also shall worship, because of the LORD
c46027	that is faithful,
c46028	<i>and</i> the Holy One of Israel,
c46029	and he shall choose thee.
c46030	Thus saith the LORD,
c46031	In an acceptable time have I heard
c46032	thee, and in a day of salvation have I helped
c46033	thee: and I will preserve
c46034	thee, and give thee for a covenant of the people,
c46035	to establish the earth,
c46036	to cause to inherit the desolate heritages;
c46037	That thou mayest say to the prisoners,
c46038	Go forth;
c46039	to them that <i>are</i> in darkness,
c46040	Shew yourselves.
c46041	They shall feed in the ways,
c46042	and their pastures <i>shall be</i> in all high places.
c46043	They shall not hunger
c46044	nor thirst;
c46045	neither shall the heat nor sun smite
c46046	them: for he that hath mercy on them shall lead
c46047	them, even by the springs of water shall he guide them.
c46048	And I will make all my mountains a way,
c46049	and my highways shall be exalted.
c46050	Behold, these shall come from far:
c46051	and, lo, these from the north and from the west;
c46052	and these from the land of Sinim.
c46053	Sing,
c46054	O heavens;
c46055	and be joyful,
c46056	O earth;
c46057	and break forth
c46058	O mountains:
c46059	into singing,
c46060	for the LORD hath comforted his people,
c46061	and will have mercy upon his afflicted.
c46062	But Zion said,
c46063	The LORD hath forsaken
c46064	me, and my Lord hath forgotten me.
c46065	Can a woman forget her sucking child,
c46066	that she should not have compassion on the son of her womb?
c46067	yea, they may forget,
c46068	yet will I not forget thee.
c46069	Behold, I have graven thee upon the palms of <i>my</i> hands;
c46070	thy walls <i>are</i> continually before me.
c46071	Thy children shall make haste;
c46072	thy destroyers and they that made thee waste shall go forth of thee.
c46073	Lift up thine eyes round about,
c46074	and behold:
c46075	all these gather themselves together,
c46076	<i>and</i> come
c46077	to thee. <i>As</i> I live,
c46078	saith the LORD,
c46079	thou shalt surely clothe thee with them all, as with an ornament,
c46080	and bind them <i>on thee,</i> as a bride <i>doeth.</i>
c46081	For thy waste and thy desolate places, and the land of thy destruction,
c46082	shall even now be too narrow by reason of the inhabitants,
c46083	and they that swallowed thee up shall be far away.
c46084	The children which thou shalt have, after thou hast lost the other, shall say again in thine ears,
c46085	The place <i>is</i> too strait
c46086	for me: give place
c46087	to me that I may dwell.
c46088	Then shalt thou say in thine heart,
c46089	Who hath begotten me these,
c46090	seeing I have lost my children, and am desolate,
c46091	a captive,
c46092	and removing to and fro?
c46093	these?
c46094	and who hath brought up
c46095	Behold, I was left alone;
c46096	these,
c46097	where <i>had</i> they <i>been?</i>
c46098	Thus saith the Lord GOD,
c46099	Behold, I will lift up mine hand to the Gentiles,
c46100	and set up my standard to the people:
c46101	and they shall bring thy sons in <i>their</i> arms,
c46102	and thy daughters shall be carried upon <i>their</i> shoulders.
c46103	And kings shall be thy nursing fathers,
c46104	and their queens thy nursing mothers:
c46105	to thee with <i>their</i> face toward the earth,
c46106	they shall bow down
c46107	and lick up the dust of thy feet;
c46108	and thou shalt know
c46109	that I <i>am</i> the LORD:
c46110	for they shall not be ashamed that wait for me.
c46111	Shall the prey be taken from the mighty,
c46112	or the lawful captive delivered?
c46113	But thus saith the LORD,
c46114	Even the captives of the mighty shall be taken away,
c46115	and the prey of the terrible shall be delivered:
c46116	for I will contend with him that contendeth with
c46117	thee, and I will save thy children.
c46118	And I will feed them that oppress thee with their own flesh;
c46119	and they shall be drunken with their own blood, as with sweet wine:
c46120	and all flesh shall know
c46121	that I the LORD <i>am</i> thy Saviour and thy Redeemer, the mighty One of Jacob.
c46122	Thus saith the LORD,
c46123	Where <i>is</i> the bill of your mother's divorcement,
c46124	whom I have put away?
c46125	or which of my creditors
c46126	<i>is it</i> to whom I have sold
c46127	you? Behold, for your iniquities have ye sold yourselves,
c46128	and for your transgressions is your mother put away.
c46129	Wherefore, when I came,
c46130	<i>was there</i> no man?
c46131	when I called,
c46132	<i>was there</i> none to answer?
c46133	Is my hand shortened at all, that it cannot redeem?
c46134	or have I no power
c46135	to deliver?
c46136	behold, at my rebuke I dry up the sea,
c46137	I make the rivers a wilderness:
c46138	their fish stinketh, because <i>there is</i> no water,
c46139	and dieth for thirst.
c46140	I clothe the heavens with blackness,
c46141	and I make sackcloth their covering.
c46142	The Lord GOD hath given me the tongue of the learned,
c46143	that I should know
c46144	how to speak a word in season to <i>him that is</i> weary:
c46145	he wakeneth morning by morning,
c46146	he wakeneth mine ear
c46147	to hear as the learned.
c46148	The Lord GOD hath opened mine ear,
c46149	and I was not rebellious,
c46150	neither turned away back.
c46151	I gave my back to the smiters,
c46152	and my cheeks to them that plucked off the hair:
c46153	I hid not my face from shame and spitting.
c46154	For the Lord GOD will help
c46155	me; therefore shall I not be confounded:
c46156	therefore have I set my face like a flint,
c46157	and I know
c46158	that I shall not be ashamed.
c46159	<i>He is</i> near that justifieth
c46160	me; who will contend with
c46161	me? let us stand together:
c46162	who <i>is</i> mine adversary?
c46163	let him come near to me.
c46164	Behold, the Lord GOD will help
c46165	me; who <i>is</i> he
c46166	<i>that</i> shall condemn
c46167	me? lo, they all shall wax old as a garment;
c46168	the moth shall eat them up.
c46169	Who <i>is</i> among you that feareth the LORD,
c46170	that obeyeth the voice of his servant,
c46171	that walketh <i>in</i> darkness,
c46172	and hath no light?
c46173	let him trust in the name of the LORD,
c46174	and stay upon his God.
c46175	Behold, all
c46176	ye that kindle a fire,
c46177	that compass <i>yourselves</i> about with sparks:
c46178	walk in the light of your fire,
c46179	and in the sparks
c46180	<i>that</i> ye have kindled.
c46181	This shall ye have of mine hand;
c46182	ye shall lie down in sorrow.
c46183	Hearken to
c46184	me, ye that follow after righteousness,
c46185	ye that seek the LORD:
c46186	look unto the rock
c46187	<i>whence</i> ye are hewn,
c46188	and to the hole of the pit
c46189	<i>whence</i> ye are digged.
c46190	Look unto Abraham your father,
c46191	and unto Sarah
c46192	<i>that</i> bare
c46193	you: for I called him alone,
c46194	and blessed
c46195	him, and increased him.
c46196	For the LORD shall comfort Zion:
c46197	he will comfort all her waste places;
c46198	and he will make her wilderness like Eden,
c46199	and her desert like the garden of the LORD;
c46200	joy and gladness shall be found therein, thanksgiving, and the voice of melody.
c46201	Hearken unto
c46202	me, my people;
c46204	me, O my nation:
c46205	and give ear unto
c46206	for a law shall proceed from
c46207	me, and I will make my judgment to rest for a light of the people.
c46208	My righteousness <i>is</i> near;
c46209	my salvation is gone forth,
c46210	and mine arms shall judge the people;
c46211	the isles shall wait upon
c46212	me, and on mine arm shall they trust.
c46213	Lift up your eyes to the heavens,
c46214	and look upon the earth beneath:
c46215	for the heavens shall vanish away like smoke,
c46216	and the earth shall wax old like a garment,
c46217	and they that dwell therein shall die in like manner:
c46218	but my salvation shall be for ever,
c46219	and my righteousness shall not be abolished.
c46220	Hearken unto
c46221	me, ye that know righteousness,
c46222	the people
c46223	in whose heart <i>is</i> my law;
c46224	fear ye not the reproach of men,
c46225	neither be ye afraid of their revilings.
c46226	For the moth shall eat them up like a garment,
c46227	and the worm shall eat them like wool:
c46228	but my righteousness shall be for ever,
c46229	and my salvation from generation to generation.
c46230	Awake,
c46231	awake,
c46232	put on strength,
c46233	O arm of the LORD;
c46234	awake, as in the ancient days, in the generations of old.
c46235	<i>Art</i> thou not it
c46236	that hath cut Rahab,
c46237	<i>and</i> wounded the dragon?
c46238	<i>Art</i> thou not it
c46239	which hath dried the sea, the waters of the great deep;
c46240	that hath made the depths of the sea a way
c46241	for the ransomed to pass over?
c46242	Therefore the redeemed of the LORD shall return,
c46243	and come with singing unto Zion;
c46244	and everlasting joy <i>shall be</i> upon their head:
c46245	they shall obtain gladness and joy;
c46246	<i>and</i> sorrow and mourning shall flee away.
c46247	I,
c46248	<i>even</i> I, <i>am</i> he
c46249	that comforteth
c46250	you: who <i>art</i> thou,
c46251	that thou shouldest be afraid of a man
c46252	<i>that</i> shall die,
c46253	and of the son of man
c46254	<i>which</i> shall be made <i>as</i> grass;
c46255	And forgettest the LORD thy maker,
c46256	that hath stretched forth the heavens,
c46257	and laid the foundations of the earth;
c46258	and hast feared continually every day because of the fury of the oppressor,
c46259	as if he were ready
c46260	to destroy?
c46261	and where <i>is</i> the fury of the oppressor?
c46262	The captive exile hasteneth
c46263	that he may be loosed,
c46264	and that he should not die in the pit,
c46265	nor that his bread should fail.
c46266	But I <i>am</i> the LORD thy God,
c46267	that divided the sea,
c46268	whose waves roared:
c46269	The LORD of hosts <i>is</i> his name.
c46270	And I have put my words in thy mouth,
c46271	and I have covered thee in the shadow of mine hand,
c46272	that I may plant the heavens,
c46273	and lay the foundations of the earth,
c46274	and say unto Zion,
c46275	Thou <i>art</i> my people.
c46276	Awake,
c46277	awake,
c46278	stand up,
c46279	O Jerusalem,
c46280	which hast drunk at the hand of the LORD the cup of his fury;
c46281	thou hast drunken the dregs of the cup of trembling,
c46282	<i>and</i> wrung <i>them</i> out.
c46283	<i>There is</i> none
c46284	to guide
c46285	her among all the sons
c46286	<i>whom</i> she hath brought forth;
c46287	neither
c46288	<i>is there any</i> that taketh her by the hand
c46289	of all the sons
c46290	<i>that</i> she hath brought up.
c46291	These two <i>things</i> are come
c46292	unto thee; who shall be sorry
c46293	for thee? desolation, and destruction, and the famine, and the sword:
c46294	by whom shall I comfort thee?
c46295	Thy sons have fainted,
c46296	they lie at the head of all the streets, as a wild bull in a net:
c46297	they are full of the fury of the LORD, the rebuke of thy God.
c46298	Therefore hear now this,
c46299	thou afflicted,
c46300	and drunken,
c46301	but not with wine:
c46302	Thus saith thy Lord the LORD, and thy God
c46303	<i>that</i> pleadeth the cause of his people,
c46304	Behold, I have taken out of thine hand the cup of trembling,
c46305	<i>even</i> the dregs of the cup of my fury;
c46306	thou shalt no more
c46307	drink it again:
c46308	But I will put it into the hand of them that afflict
c46309	thee; which have said to thy soul,
c46310	Bow down,
c46311	that we may go over:
c46312	and thou hast laid thy body as the ground,
c46313	and as the street, to them that went over.
c46314	Awake,
c46315	awake;
c46316	put on thy strength,
c46317	O Zion;
c46318	put on thy beautiful garments,
c46319	O Jerusalem, the holy city:
c46320	for henceforth there shall no
c46321	more come into thee the uncircumcised and the unclean.
c46322	Shake thyself from the dust;
c46323	arise,
c46324	<i>and</i> sit down,
c46325	O Jerusalem:
c46326	loose thyself from the bands of thy neck,
c46327	O captive daughter of Zion.
c46328	For thus saith the LORD,
c46329	Ye have sold yourselves for nought;
c46330	and ye shall be redeemed without money.
c46331	For thus saith the Lord GOD,
c46332	My people went down aforetime into Egypt
c46333	to sojourn there;
c46334	and the Assyrian oppressed them without cause.
c46335	Now
c46336	therefore, what have I here,
c46337	saith the LORD,
c46338	that my people is taken away for nought?
c46339	they that rule over them make them to howl,
c46340	saith the LORD;
c46341	and my name continually every day <i>is</i> blasphemed.
c46342	Therefore my people shall know my name:
c46343	therefore <i>they shall know</i> in that day
c46344	that I <i>am</i> he
c46345	that doth speak:
c46346	behold, <i>it is</i> I.
c46347	How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him that bringeth good tidings,
c46348	that publisheth peace;
c46349	that bringeth good tidings of good,
c46350	that publisheth salvation;
c46351	that saith unto Zion,
c46352	Thy God reigneth!
c46353	Thy watchmen shall lift up the voice; with the voice
c46354	together shall they sing:
c46355	for they shall see eye to eye,
c46356	when the LORD shall bring again Zion.
c46357	Break forth into joy,
c46358	sing together,
c46359	ye waste places of Jerusalem:
c46360	for the LORD hath comforted his people,
c46361	he hath redeemed Jerusalem.
c46362	The LORD hath made bare his holy arm in the eyes of all the nations;
c46363	and all the ends of the earth shall see the salvation of our God.
c46364	Depart
c46365	ye, depart
c46366	ye, go ye out from thence,
c46367	touch no unclean
c46368	<i>thing;</i> go ye out of the midst
c46369	of her; be ye clean,
c46370	that bear the vessels of the LORD.
c46371	For ye shall not go out with haste,
c46372	nor go by flight:
c46373	for the LORD will go before
c46374	you; and the God of Israel <i>will be</i> your rereward.
c46375	Behold, my servant shall deal prudently,
c46376	he shall be exalted
c46377	and extolled,
c46378	and be very high.
c46379	As many were astonied at
c46380	thee; his visage was so marred more than any man,
c46381	and his form more than the sons of men:
c46382	So shall he sprinkle many nations;
c46383	the kings shall shut their mouths at
c46384	him: for
c46385	<i>that</i> which had not been told
c46386	them shall they see;
c46388	and <i>that</i> which they had not heard
c46389	shall they consider.
c46390	Who hath believed our report?
c46391	and to whom is the arm of the LORD revealed?
c46392	For he shall grow up before him as a tender plant,
c46393	and as a root out of a dry ground:
c46394	he hath no form
c46395	nor comeliness;
c46396	and when we shall see
c46397	him, <i>there is</i> no beauty
c46398	that we should desire him.
c46399	He is despised
c46400	and rejected of men;
c46401	a man of sorrows,
c46402	and acquainted with grief:
c46403	and we hid as it were <i>our</i> faces from him; he was despised,
c46404	and we esteemed him not.
c46405	Surely he hath borne our griefs,
c46406	our sorrows:
c46407	and carried
c46408	yet we did esteem him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted.
c46409	But he <i>was</i> wounded for our transgressions,
c46410	<i>he was</i> bruised for our iniquities:
c46411	the chastisement of our peace <i>was</i> upon
c46412	him; and with his stripes we are healed.
c46413	All we like sheep have gone astray;
c46414	every one to his own way;
c46415	we have turned
c46416	and the LORD hath laid on him the iniquity of us all.
c46417	He was oppressed,
c46418	and he was afflicted,
c46419	yet he opened not his mouth:
c46421	he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter,
c46422	and as a sheep
c46423	before her shearers is dumb,
c46424	so he openeth not his mouth.
c46425	He was taken from prison and from judgment:
c46426	and who shall declare his generation?
c46427	for he was cut off out of the land of the living:
c46428	for the transgression of my people was he stricken.
c46429	And he made his grave with the wicked,
c46430	and with the rich in his death;
c46431	because he had done no violence,
c46432	neither <i>was any</i> deceit in his mouth.
c46433	Yet it pleased the LORD
c46434	to bruise
c46435	him; he hath put <i>him</i> to grief:
c46436	when thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin,
c46437	he shall see <i>his</i> seed,
c46438	he shall prolong <i>his</i> days,
c46439	and the pleasure of the LORD shall prosper in his hand.
c46440	He shall see of the travail of his soul,
c46441	<i>and</i> shall be satisfied:
c46442	by his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many;
c46443	for he shall bear their iniquities.
c46444	Therefore will I divide him <i>a portion</i> with the great,
c46445	and he shall divide the spoil with the strong;
c46446	because he hath poured out his soul unto death:
c46448	and he was numbered with the transgressors; and he bare the sin of many,
c46449	and made intercession for the transgressors.
c46450	Sing,
c46451	O barren,
c46452	thou <i>that</i> didst not bear;
c46453	break forth into singing,
c46454	and cry aloud,
c46455	thou <i>that</i> didst not travail with child:
c46456	for more <i>are</i> the children of the desolate than the children of the married wife,
c46457	saith the LORD.
c46458	Enlarge the place of thy tent,
c46459	and let them stretch forth the curtains of thine habitations:
c46460	spare not,
c46461	lengthen thy cords,
c46462	and strengthen thy stakes;
c46463	For thou shalt break forth on the right hand and on the left;
c46464	and thy seed shall inherit the Gentiles,
c46465	and make the desolate cities to be inhabited.
c46466	Fear not;
c46467	for thou shalt not be ashamed:
c46468	neither be thou confounded;
c46469	for thou shalt not be put to shame:
c46470	for thou shalt forget the shame of thy youth,
c46471	and shalt not remember the reproach of thy widowhood any more.
c46472	For thy Maker <i>is</i> thine husband;
c46473	the LORD of hosts <i>is</i> his name;
c46474	and thy Redeemer the Holy One of Israel;
c46475	The God of the whole earth shall he be called.
c46476	For the LORD hath called thee as a woman forsaken and grieved in spirit,
c46477	and a wife of youth,
c46478	when thou wast refused,
c46479	saith thy God.
c46480	For a small moment have I forsaken
c46481	thee; but with great mercies will I gather thee.
c46482	In a little wrath I hid my face from thee for a moment;
c46483	but with everlasting kindness will I have mercy
c46484	on thee, saith the LORD thy Redeemer.
c46485	For this <i>is as</i> the waters of Noah
c46486	unto me: for <i>as</i> I have sworn
c46487	that the waters of Noah should no more go over the earth;
c46488	so have I sworn
c46489	that I would not be wroth with
c46490	thee, nor rebuke thee.
c46491	For the mountains shall depart,
c46492	and the hills be removed;
c46493	but my kindness shall not depart from
c46494	thee, neither shall the covenant of my peace be removed,
c46495	saith the LORD that hath mercy on thee.
c46496	O thou afflicted,
c46497	tossed with tempest,
c46498	<i>and</i> not comforted,
c46499	behold, I will lay thy stones with fair colours,
c46500	and lay thy foundations with sapphires.
c46501	And I will make thy windows of agates,
c46502	and thy gates of carbuncles,
c46503	and all thy borders of pleasant stones.
c46504	And all thy children <i>shall be</i> taught of the LORD;
c46505	and great <i>shall be</i> the peace of thy children.
c46506	In righteousness shalt thou be established:
c46507	thou shalt be far from oppression;
c46508	for thou shalt not fear:
c46509	and from terror;
c46510	for it shall not come near thee.
c46511	Behold, they shall surely gather together,
c46512	<i>but</i> not by me: whosoever shall gather together against
c46514	thee shall fall for thy sake.
c46515	Behold, I have created the smith
c46516	that bloweth the coals in the fire,
c46517	and that bringeth forth an instrument for his work;
c46518	and I have created the waster
c46519	to destroy.
c46521	that is formed against thee shall prosper;
c46522	No weapon
c46523	and every tongue
c46524	<i>that</i> shall rise against thee in judgment
c46525	thou shalt condemn.
c46526	This <i>is</i> the heritage of the servants of the LORD, and their righteousness <i>is</i> of
c46527	me, saith the LORD.
c46528	Ho,
c46529	every one that thirsteth,
c46530	come ye to the waters,
c46532	and he that hath no money;
c46533	come
c46534	ye, buy,
c46535	and eat;
c46536	yea, come,
c46537	buy wine and milk without money and without price.
c46538	Wherefore do ye spend money for <i>that which is</i> not bread?
c46539	and your labour
c46540	for <i>that which</i> satisfieth not?
c46541	hearken diligently unto
c46542	me, and eat ye <i>that which is</i> good,
c46543	and let your soul delight itself in fatness.
c46544	Incline your ear,
c46545	and come unto
c46546	me: hear,
c46547	and your soul shall live;
c46548	and I will make an everlasting covenant with you, <i>even</i> the sure mercies of David.
c46549	Behold, I have given him <i>for</i> a witness to the people, a leader and commander to the people.
c46550	Behold, thou shalt call a nation
c46551	<i>that</i> thou knowest not,
c46553	and nations
c46554	<i>that</i> knew not
c46555	thee shall run unto thee because of the LORD thy God, and for the Holy One of Israel;
c46556	for he hath glorified thee.
c46557	Seek ye the LORD
c46558	while he may be found,
c46559	call
c46560	ye upon him while he is near:
c46561	Let the wicked forsake his way,
c46562	and the unrighteous man his thoughts:
c46563	and let him return unto the LORD,
c46564	and he will have mercy
c46565	upon him; and to our God,
c46566	for he will abundantly
c46567	pardon.
c46568	For my thoughts <i>are</i> not your thoughts,
c46569	neither <i>are</i> your ways my ways,
c46570	saith the LORD.
c46571	For <i>as</i> the heavens are higher than the earth,
c46572	so are my ways higher than your ways,
c46573	and my thoughts than your thoughts.
c46574	For
c46575	as the rain cometh down, and the snow from heaven,
c46576	and returneth not thither,
c46577	but watereth the earth,
c46578	and maketh it bring forth
c46579	and bud,
c46580	that it may give seed to the sower,
c46581	and bread to the eater:
c46582	So shall my word be
c46583	that goeth forth out of my mouth:
c46584	it shall not return unto me void,
c46585	but it shall accomplish
c46586	that which I please,
c46587	and it shall prosper
c46588	<i>in the thing</i> whereto I sent it.
c46589	For ye shall go out with joy,
c46590	and be led forth with peace:
c46591	the mountains and the hills shall break forth before you into singing,
c46592	and all the trees of the field shall clap <i>their</i> hands.
c46593	Instead of the thorn shall come up the fir tree,
c46594	and instead of the brier shall come up the myrtle tree:
c46595	and it shall be to the LORD for a name, for an everlasting sign
c46596	<i>that</i> shall not be cut off.
c46597	Thus saith the LORD,
c46598	Keep ye judgment,
c46599	and do justice:
c46600	for my salvation <i>is</i> near
c46601	to come,
c46602	and my righteousness
c46603	to be revealed.
c46604	Blessed <i>is</i> the man
c46605	<i>that</i> doeth this,
c46606	and the son of man
c46607	<i>that</i> layeth hold
c46608	on it; that keepeth the sabbath
c46609	from polluting
c46610	it, and keepeth his hand
c46611	from doing any evil.
c46612	Neither let the son of the stranger, that hath joined himself to the LORD, speak,
c46614	saying,
c46615	The LORD hath utterly separated me from his people:
c46616	neither let the eunuch say,
c46617	Behold, I <i>am</i> a dry tree.
c46618	For thus saith the LORD unto the eunuchs
c46619	that keep my sabbaths,
c46620	and choose
c46621	<i>the things</i> that please
c46622	me, and take hold of my covenant;
c46623	Even unto them will I give in mine house and within my walls a place and a name
c46624	better than of sons and of daughters:
c46625	I will give them an everlasting name,
c46626	that shall not be cut off.
c46627	Also the sons of the stranger,
c46628	that join themselves to the LORD,
c46629	to serve
c46630	him, and to love the name of the LORD,
c46631	to be his servants,
c46632	every one
c46633	that keepeth the sabbath
c46634	from polluting
c46635	it, and taketh hold of my covenant;
c46636	Even them will I bring to my holy mountain,
c46637	and make them joyful in my house of prayer:
c46638	their burnt offerings and their sacrifices <i>shall be</i> accepted upon mine altar;
c46639	for mine house shall be called an house of prayer for all people.
c46640	The Lord GOD which gathereth the outcasts of Israel saith,
c46642	Yet will I gather <i>others</i> to him, beside those that are gathered unto him.
c46643	All ye beasts of the field,
c46644	come
c46645	to devour,
c46646	<i>yea,</i> all ye beasts in the forest.
c46647	His watchmen <i>are</i> blind:
c46648	they are all ignorant,
c46649	they <i>are</i> all dumb dogs,
c46650	they cannot
c46651	bark;
c46652	sleeping,
c46653	lying down,
c46654	loving
c46655	to slumber.
c46656	Yea, <i>they are</i> greedy dogs
c46657	<i>which</i> can never have enough,
c46658	and they <i>are</i> shepherds
c46659	<i>that</i> cannot
c46660	understand:
c46661	they all look to their own way,
c46662	every one for his gain, from his quarter.
c46663	Come
c46664	ye, <i>say they,</i> I will fetch wine,
c46665	and we will fill ourselves with strong drink;
c46666	and to morrow shall be as this day,
c46667	<i>and</i> much more abundant.
c46668	The righteous perisheth,
c46669	and no man
c46670	layeth <i>it</i> to heart:
c46671	and merciful men <i>are</i> taken away,
c46672	none considering
c46673	that the righteous is taken away from the evil <i>to come.</i>
c46674	He shall enter into peace:
c46675	they shall rest in their beds,
c46676	<i>each one</i> walking <i>in</i> his uprightness.
c46677	But draw near hither, ye
c46678	sons of the sorceress, the seed of the adulterer
c46679	and the whore.
c46680	Against whom do ye sport yourselves?
c46681	against whom make ye a wide mouth,
c46682	<i>and</i> draw out the tongue?
c46683	<i>are</i> ye not children of transgression, a seed of falsehood,
c46684	Enflaming yourselves with idols under every green tree,
c46685	slaying the children in the valleys under the clifts of the rocks?
c46686	Among the smooth <i>stones</i> of the stream <i>is</i> thy portion;
c46687	they,
c46688	they <i>are</i> thy lot:
c46689	even to them hast thou poured a drink offering,
c46690	thou hast offered a meat offering.
c46691	Should I receive comfort in these?
c46692	Upon a lofty and high mountain hast thou set thy bed:
c46693	even thither wentest thou up
c46694	to offer sacrifice.
c46695	Behind the doors also and the posts hast thou set up thy remembrance:
c46696	for thou hast discovered <i>thyself to another</i> than
c46697	me, and art gone up;
c46698	thou hast enlarged thy bed,
c46699	and made thee <i>a covenant</i> with
c46700	them; thou lovedst their bed
c46701	where thou sawest <i>it.</i>
c46702	And thou wentest to the king with ointment,
c46703	and didst increase thy perfumes,
c46704	and didst send thy messengers far off,
c46705	and didst debase <i>thyself even</i> unto hell.
c46706	Thou art wearied in the greatness of thy way;
c46707	<i>yet</i> saidst thou not,
c46708	There is no hope:
c46709	thou hast found the life of thine hand;
c46710	therefore thou wast not grieved.
c46711	And of whom hast thou been afraid
c46712	or feared,
c46713	that thou hast lied,
c46714	and hast not remembered
c46715	me, nor laid <i>it</i> to thy heart?
c46716	have not I held my peace
c46717	even of old,
c46718	and thou fearest me not?
c46719	I will declare thy righteousness,
c46720	and thy works;
c46721	for they shall not profit thee.
c46722	When thou criest,
c46723	let thy companies deliver
c46724	thee; but the wind shall carry them all away;
c46725	vanity shall take
c46727	<i>them:</i> but he that putteth his trust
c46728	in me shall possess the land,
c46729	and shall inherit my holy mountain;
c46730	And shall say,
c46731	Cast ye up,
c46732	cast ye up,
c46733	prepare the way,
c46734	take up the stumblingblock out of the way of my people.
c46735	For thus saith the high and lofty One
c46736	that inhabiteth eternity,
c46737	whose name <i>is</i> Holy;
c46738	I dwell in the high and holy
c46739	<i>place,</i> with him also <i>that is</i> of a contrite and humble spirit,
c46740	to revive the spirit of the humble,
c46741	and to revive the heart of the contrite ones.
c46742	For I will not contend for ever,
c46743	neither will I be always wroth:
c46744	for the spirit should fail before
c46745	me, and the souls
c46746	<i>which</i> I have made.
c46747	For the iniquity of his covetousness was I wroth,
c46748	and smote
c46749	him: I hid
c46750	me, and was wroth,
c46751	and he went on frowardly in the way of his heart.
c46752	I have seen his ways,
c46753	and will heal
c46754	him: I will lead
c46755	him also, and restore comforts unto him and to his mourners.
c46756	I create the fruit of the lips;
c46757	Peace, peace to <i>him that is</i> far off, and to <i>him that is</i> near,
c46758	saith the LORD;
c46759	and I will heal him.
c46760	But the wicked <i>are</i> like the troubled sea,
c46762	when
c46763	rest,
c46764	it cannot
c46765	whose waters cast up mire and dirt.
c46766	<i>There is</i> no peace,
c46767	saith my God,
c46768	to the wicked.
c46769	Cry aloud,
c46770	spare not,
c46771	lift up thy voice like a trumpet,
c46772	and shew my people their transgression,
c46773	and the house of Jacob their sins.
c46774	Yet they seek me daily,
c46775	and delight to know my ways, as a nation
c46776	that did righteousness,
c46777	and forsook not the ordinance of their God:
c46778	they ask of me the ordinances of justice;
c46779	they take delight in approaching to God.
c46780	Wherefore have we fasted,
c46781	<i>say they,</i> and thou seest not?
c46782	<i>wherefore</i> have we afflicted our soul,
c46783	and thou takest no knowledge?
c46784	Behold, in the day of your fast ye find pleasure,
c46785	and exact all your labours.
c46786	Behold, ye fast for strife and debate,
c46787	and to smite with the fist of wickedness:
c46788	ye shall not fast as <i>ye do this</i> day,
c46789	to make your voice to be heard on high.
c46790	Is it such a fast
c46791	that I have chosen?
c46792	a day
c46793	for a man to afflict his soul?
c46794	<i>is it</i> to bow down his head as a bulrush,
c46795	and to spread sackcloth and ashes
c46796	<i>under him?</i> wilt thou call this a fast, and an acceptable day to the LORD?
c46797	<i>Is</i> not this the fast
c46798	that I have chosen?
c46799	to loose the bands of wickedness,
c46800	to undo the heavy burdens,
c46801	and to let the oppressed go free,
c46802	and that ye break every yoke?
c46803	<i>Is it</i> not to deal thy bread to the hungry,
c46804	and that thou bring the poor that are cast out to thy house?
c46805	when thou seest the naked,
c46806	that thou cover
c46807	him; and that thou hide not thyself from thine own flesh?
c46808	Then shall thy light break forth as the morning,
c46809	and thine health shall spring forth speedily:
c46810	and thy righteousness shall go before
c46811	thee; the glory of the LORD shall be thy rereward.
c46812	Then shalt thou call,
c46813	and the LORD shall answer;
c46814	thou shalt cry,
c46815	and he shall say,
c46816	Here
c46817	I <i>am.</i> If thou take away from the midst of thee the yoke,
c46818	the putting forth of the finger,
c46819	and speaking vanity;
c46820	And <i>if</i> thou draw out thy soul to the hungry,
c46821	and satisfy the afflicted soul;
c46822	then shall thy light rise in obscurity,
c46823	and thy darkness <i>be</i> as the noonday:
c46824	And the LORD shall guide thee continually,
c46825	and satisfy thy soul in drought,
c46826	and make fat thy bones:
c46827	and thou shalt be like a watered garden,
c46828	and like a spring of water,
c46829	whose waters fail not.
c46830	And <i>they that shall be</i> of thee shall build the old waste places:
c46831	thou shalt raise up the foundations of many generations;
c46832	and thou shalt be called,
c46833	The repairer of the breach,
c46834	The restorer of paths
c46835	to dwell in.
c46836	If thou turn away thy foot from the sabbath,
c46837	<i>from</i> doing thy pleasure on my holy day;
c46838	and call the sabbath a delight,
c46839	the holy of the LORD, honourable;
c46840	and shalt honour
c46841	him, not doing thine own ways,
c46842	nor finding thine own pleasure,
c46843	nor speaking <i>thine own</i> words:
c46844	Then shalt thou delight thyself in the LORD;
c46845	and I will cause thee to ride upon the high places of the earth,
c46846	and feed thee with the heritage of Jacob thy father:
c46847	for the mouth of the LORD hath spoken <i>it.</i>
c46848	Behold, the LORD'S hand is not shortened,
c46849	that it cannot save;
c46850	neither his ear heavy,
c46851	that it cannot hear:
c46852	But your iniquities have separated between you and your God,
c46853	and your sins have hid <i>his</i> face from
c46854	you, that he will not hear.
c46855	For your hands are defiled with blood,
c46856	and your fingers with iniquity;
c46857	your lips have spoken lies,
c46858	your tongue hath muttered perverseness.
c46859	None calleth for justice,
c46860	nor <i>any</i> pleadeth for truth:
c46861	they trust in vanity,
c46862	and speak lies;
c46863	they conceive mischief,
c46864	and bring forth iniquity.
c46865	They hatch cockatrice' eggs,
c46866	and weave the spider's web:
c46867	he that eateth of their eggs
c46868	dieth,
c46870	and that which is crushed
c46871	breaketh out into a viper.
c46872	Their webs shall not become garments,
c46873	neither shall they cover themselves with their works:
c46874	their works <i>are</i> works of iniquity,
c46875	and the act of violence <i>is</i> in their hands.
c46876	Their feet run to evil,
c46877	and they make haste
c46878	to shed innocent blood:
c46879	their thoughts <i>are</i> thoughts of iniquity;
c46880	wasting and destruction <i>are</i> in their paths.
c46881	The way of peace they know not;
c46882	and <i>there is</i> no judgment in their goings:
c46883	they have made them crooked paths:
c46884	whosoever
c46885	goeth
c46886	therein shall not know peace.
c46887	Therefore is judgment far from
c46888	us, neither doth justice overtake
c46889	us: we wait for light,
c46890	but behold obscurity;
c46891	for brightness,
c46892	<i>but</i> we walk in darkness.
c46893	We grope for the wall like the blind,
c46894	and we grope as if <i>we had</i> no eyes:
c46895	we stumble at noonday as in the night;
c46896	<i>we are</i> in desolate places as dead <i>men.</i>
c46897	We roar all like bears,
c46898	and mourn sore like doves:
c46899	we look for judgment,
c46900	but <i>there is</i> none;
c46901	for salvation,
c46902	<i>but</i> it is far off from us.
c46903	For our transgressions are multiplied before
c46904	thee, and our sins testify
c46905	against us: for our transgressions <i>are</i> with
c46906	us; and <i>as for</i> our iniquities,
c46907	we know them;
c46908	In transgressing
c46909	and lying against the LORD,
c46910	and departing away from our God,
c46911	speaking oppression and revolt,
c46912	conceiving
c46913	and uttering from the heart words of falsehood.
c46914	And judgment is turned away backward,
c46915	and justice standeth afar off:
c46916	for truth is fallen in the street,
c46917	and equity cannot
c46918	enter.
c46919	Yea, truth faileth;
c46921	and he <i>that</i> departeth from evil
c46922	maketh himself a prey:
c46923	and the LORD saw
c46924	<i>it,</i> and it displeased
c46925	him that <i>there was</i> no judgment.
c46926	And he saw
c46927	that <i>there was</i> no man,
c46928	and wondered
c46929	that <i>there was</i> no intercessor:
c46930	therefore his arm brought salvation
c46931	unto him; and his righteousness,
c46932	it sustained him.
c46933	For he put on righteousness as a breastplate,
c46934	and an helmet of salvation upon his head;
c46935	and he put on the garments of vengeance <i>for</i> clothing,
c46936	and was clad with zeal as a cloke.
c46937	According to <i>their</i> deeds, accordingly he will repay,
c46938	fury to his adversaries,
c46939	recompence to his enemies;
c46940	to the islands he will repay recompence.
c46941	So shall they fear the name of the LORD from the west,
c46942	and his glory from the rising of the sun.
c46943	When the enemy shall come in like a flood,
c46944	the Spirit of the LORD shall lift up a standard against him.
c46945	And the Redeemer shall come to Zion,
c46946	and unto them that turn from transgression in Jacob,
c46947	saith the LORD.
c46948	As for me,
c46949	this <i>is</i> my covenant with
c46950	them, saith the LORD;
c46951	My spirit
c46952	that <i>is</i> upon
c46953	thee, and my words
c46954	which I have put in thy mouth,
c46955	shall not depart out of thy mouth, nor out of the mouth of thy seed, nor out of the mouth of thy seed's seed,
c46956	saith the LORD,
c46957	from henceforth and for ever.
c46958	Arise,
c46959	shine;
c46960	for thy light is come,
c46961	and the glory of the LORD is risen upon thee.
c46962	For, behold, the darkness shall cover the earth,
c46963	and gross darkness the people:
c46964	but the LORD shall arise upon
c46965	thee, and his glory shall be seen upon thee.
c46966	And the Gentiles shall come to thy light,
c46967	and kings to the brightness of thy rising.
c46968	Lift up thine eyes round about,
c46969	and see:
c46970	all they gather themselves together,
c46971	they come
c46972	to thee: thy sons shall come from far,
c46973	and thy daughters shall be nursed at <i>thy</i> side.
c46974	Then thou shalt see,
c46975	and flow together,
c46977	and thine heart shall fear, and be enlarged;
c46978	because the abundance of the sea shall be converted unto
c46979	thee, the forces of the Gentiles shall come unto thee.
c46980	The multitude of camels shall cover thee, the dromedaries of Midian and Ephah;
c46981	all they from Sheba shall come:
c46982	they shall bring gold and incense;
c46983	and they shall shew forth the praises of the LORD.
c46984	All the flocks of Kedar shall be gathered together
c46985	unto thee, the rams of Nebaioth shall minister
c46986	unto thee: they shall come up with acceptance on mine altar,
c46987	and I will glorify the house of my glory.
c46988	Who <i>are</i> these
c46989	<i>that</i> fly as a cloud,
c46990	and as the doves to their windows?
c46991	Surely the isles shall wait
c46992	for me, and the ships of Tarshish first,
c46993	to bring thy sons from far,
c46994	their silver and their gold with them, unto the name of the LORD thy God, and to the Holy One of Israel,
c46995	because he hath glorified thee.
c46996	And the sons of strangers shall build up thy walls,
c46997	and their kings shall minister
c46998	unto thee: for in my wrath I smote
c46999	thee, but in my favour have I had mercy on thee.
c47000	Therefore thy gates shall be open continually;
c47001	they shall not be shut day nor night;
c47002	that <i>men</i> may bring unto thee the forces of the Gentiles,
c47003	and <i>that</i> their kings <i>may be</i> brought.
c47004	For the nation and kingdom
c47005	that will not serve
c47006	thee shall perish;
c47007	yea, <i>those</i> nations shall be utterly wasted.
c47008	The glory of Lebanon shall come unto thee, the fir tree, the pine tree, and the box together,
c47009	to beautify the place of my sanctuary;
c47010	and I will make the place of my feet glorious.
c47011	thee shall come bending unto
c47013	The sons also of them that afflicted
c47014	thee; and all they that despised thee shall bow themselves down at the soles of thy feet;
c47015	and they shall call thee, The city of the LORD, The Zion of the Holy One of Israel.
c47016	Whereas thou hast been forsaken and hated,
c47017	so that no man went through
c47018	<i>thee,</i> I will make thee an eternal excellency,
c47019	a joy of many generations.
c47020	Thou shalt also suck the milk of the Gentiles,
c47021	and shalt suck the breast of kings:
c47022	and thou shalt know
c47023	that I the LORD <i>am</i> thy Saviour and thy Redeemer, the mighty One of Jacob.
c47024	For brass I will bring gold,
c47025	and for iron I will bring silver,
c47026	and for wood brass,
c47027	and for stones iron:
c47028	I will also make thy officers peace,
c47029	and thine exactors righteousness.
c47030	Violence shall no more be heard in thy land,
c47031	wasting nor destruction within thy borders;
c47032	but thou shalt call thy walls Salvation,
c47033	and thy gates Praise.
c47034	The sun shall be no more thy light by day;
c47035	neither for brightness shall the moon give light
c47036	unto thee: but the LORD shall be unto thee an everlasting light,
c47037	and thy God thy glory.
c47038	Thy sun shall no more go down;
c47039	neither shall thy moon withdraw itself:
c47040	for the LORD shall be thine everlasting light,
c47041	and the days of thy mourning shall be ended.
c47042	Thy people
c47043	also <i>shall be</i> all righteous:
c47044	they shall inherit the land for ever,
c47045	the branch of my planting, the work of my hands,
c47046	that I may be glorified.
c47047	A little one shall become a thousand,
c47048	and a small one a strong nation:
c47049	I the LORD will hasten it in his time.
c47050	The Spirit of the Lord GOD <i>is</i> upon
c47051	me; because the LORD hath anointed
c47052	me to preach good tidings unto the meek;
c47053	he hath sent
c47054	me to bind up the brokenhearted,
c47055	to proclaim liberty to the captives,
c47056	and the opening of the prison to <i>them that are</i> bound;
c47057	To proclaim the acceptable year of the LORD,
c47058	and the day of vengeance of our God;
c47059	to comfort all that mourn;
c47060	To appoint unto them that mourn in Zion,
c47061	to give unto them beauty for ashes,
c47062	the oil of joy for mourning,
c47063	the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness;
c47064	that they might be called
c47065	trees of righteousness, the planting of the LORD,
c47066	that he might be glorified.
c47067	And they shall build the old wastes,
c47068	they shall raise up the former desolations,
c47069	and they shall repair the waste cities,
c47070	the desolations of many generations.
c47071	And strangers shall stand
c47072	and feed your flocks,
c47073	and the sons of the alien <i>shall be</i> your plowmen and your vinedressers.
c47074	But ye shall be named the Priests of the LORD:
c47075	you the Ministers of our God:
c47076	<i>men</i> shall call
c47077	ye shall eat the riches of the Gentiles,
c47078	and in their glory shall ye boast yourselves.
c47079	For your shame <i>ye shall have</i> double;
c47080	and <i>for</i> confusion they shall rejoice in their portion:
c47081	therefore in their land they shall possess the double:
c47082	everlasting joy shall be unto them.
c47083	For I the LORD love judgment,
c47084	I hate robbery for burnt offering;
c47085	and I will direct their work in truth,
c47086	and I will make an everlasting covenant with them.
c47087	And their seed shall be known among the Gentiles,
c47088	and their offspring among the people:
c47089	all that see them shall acknowledge
c47090	them, that they <i>are</i> the seed
c47091	<i>which</i> the LORD hath blessed.
c47092	I will greatly rejoice in the LORD,
c47093	my soul shall be joyful in my God;
c47094	for he hath clothed me with the garments of salvation,
c47095	he hath covered me with the robe of righteousness, as a bridegroom
c47096	decketh <i>himself</i> with ornaments,
c47097	and as a bride
c47098	adorneth <i>herself</i> with her jewels.
c47099	For as the earth
c47100	bringeth forth her bud,
c47101	and as the garden
c47102	causeth the things that are sown in it to spring forth;
c47103	so the Lord GOD will cause righteousness and praise to spring forth before all the nations.
c47104	For Zion's sake will I not hold my peace,
c47105	and for Jerusalem's sake I will not rest,
c47106	until the righteousness thereof go forth as brightness,
c47107	and the salvation thereof as a lamp
c47108	<i>that</i> burneth.
c47109	And the Gentiles shall see thy righteousness,
c47110	and all kings thy glory:
c47111	and thou shalt be called by a new name,
c47112	which the mouth of the LORD shall name.
c47113	Thou shalt also be a crown of glory in the hand of the LORD,
c47114	and a royal diadem in the hand of thy God.
c47115	Thou shalt no more be termed Forsaken;
c47116	neither shall thy land any more be termed Desolate:
c47117	but thou shalt be called
c47118	Hephzibah,
c47119	and thy land Beulah:
c47120	for the LORD delighteth
c47121	in thee, and thy land shall be married.
c47122	For <i>as</i> a young man marrieth a virgin,
c47123	<i>so</i> shall thy sons marry
c47124	thee: and <i>as</i> the bridegroom rejoiceth over the bride,
c47125	<i>so</i> shall thy God rejoice over thee.
c47126	upon thy walls,
c47127	O Jerusalem,
c47128	I have set watchmen
c47129	<i>which</i> shall never hold their peace day nor night:
c47130	ye that make mention of the LORD,
c47131	keep not silence,
c47132	And give him no rest,
c47133	till he establish,
c47134	and till he make Jerusalem a praise in the earth.
c47135	The LORD hath sworn by his right hand, and by the arm of his strength,
c47136	Surely I will no more give thy corn <i>to be</i> meat for thine enemies;
c47137	and the sons of the stranger shall not drink thy wine,
c47138	for the which thou hast laboured:
c47139	But
c47140	they that have gathered
c47141	it shall eat
c47142	it, and praise the LORD;
c47144	and they that have brought it together
c47145	shall drink it in the courts of my holiness.
c47146	Go through,
c47147	go through the gates;
c47148	prepare ye the way of the people;
c47149	cast up,
c47150	cast up the highway;
c47151	gather out the stones;
c47152	lift up a standard for the people.
c47153	Behold, the LORD hath proclaimed unto the end of the world,
c47154	Say ye to the daughter of Zion,
c47155	Behold, thy salvation cometh;
c47156	behold, his reward <i>is</i> with
c47157	him, and his work before him.
c47158	And they shall call
c47159	them, The holy people, The redeemed of the LORD:
c47160	and thou shalt be called,
c47161	Sought out, A city
c47162	not forsaken.
c47163	Who <i>is</i> this that cometh from Edom, with dyed garments from Bozrah?
c47164	this
c47165	<i>that is</i> glorious in his apparel,
c47166	travelling in the greatness of his strength?
c47167	I
c47168	that speak in righteousness,
c47169	mighty
c47170	to save.
c47171	Wherefore <i>art thou</i> red in thine apparel,
c47172	and thy garments
c47173	like him that treadeth in the winefat?
c47174	I have trodden the winepress alone;
c47175	and of the people <i>there was</i> none with
c47176	me: for I will tread them in mine anger,
c47177	and trample them in my fury;
c47178	and their blood shall be sprinkled upon my garments,
c47179	and I will stain all my raiment.
c47180	For the day of vengeance <i>is</i> in mine heart,
c47181	and the year of my redeemed is come.
c47182	And I looked,
c47183	and <i>there was</i> none to help;
c47184	and I wondered
c47185	that <i>there was</i> none to uphold:
c47186	therefore mine own arm brought salvation
c47187	unto me; and my fury,
c47188	it upheld me.
c47189	And I will tread down the people in mine anger,
c47190	and make them drunk in my fury,
c47191	and I will bring down their strength to the earth.
c47192	I will mention the lovingkindnesses of the LORD,
c47193	<i>and</i> the praises of the LORD, according to all
c47194	that the LORD hath bestowed
c47195	on us, and the great goodness toward the house of Israel,
c47196	which he hath bestowed on them according to his mercies, and according to the multitude of his lovingkindnesses.
c47197	For he said,
c47198	Surely they <i>are</i> my people,
c47199	children
c47200	<i>that</i> will not lie:
c47201	so he was their Saviour.
c47202	In all their affliction he was afflicted,
c47203	and the angel of his presence saved
c47204	them: in his love and in his pity he redeemed
c47205	them; and he bare
c47206	them, and carried them all the days of old.
c47207	But they rebelled,
c47208	and vexed his holy Spirit:
c47209	therefore he was turned to be their enemy,
c47210	<i>and</i> he fought against them.
c47211	Then he remembered the days of old, Moses, <i>and</i> his people,
c47212	<i>saying,</i> Where
c47213	<i>is</i> he that brought them up out of the sea with the shepherd of his flock?
c47214	where
c47215	<i>is</i> he that put his holy Spirit within him?
c47216	That led <i>them</i> by the right hand of Moses with his glorious arm,
c47217	dividing the water before
c47218	them, to make himself an everlasting name?
c47219	That led them through the deep,
c47220	as an horse in the wilderness, <i>that</i> they should not stumble?
c47221	As a beast
c47222	goeth down into the valley,
c47223	the Spirit of the LORD caused him to rest:
c47224	so didst thou lead thy people,
c47225	to make thyself a glorious name.
c47226	Look down from heaven,
c47227	and behold from the habitation of thy holiness and of thy glory:
c47228	where <i>is</i> thy zeal and thy strength,
c47229	the sounding of thy bowels and of thy mercies toward me? are they restrained?
c47230	Doubtless thou <i>art</i> our father,
c47231	though Abraham be ignorant
c47232	of us, and Israel acknowledge us not:
c47233	thou, O LORD, <i>art</i> our father,
c47234	our redeemer; thy name <i>is</i> from everlasting.
c47235	why hast thou made us to err
c47236	O LORD,
c47237	from thy ways,
c47238	<i>and</i> hardened our heart from thy fear?
c47239	Return for thy servants' sake, the tribes of thine inheritance.
c47240	The people of thy holiness have possessed <i>it</i> but a little while:
c47241	our adversaries have trodden down thy sanctuary.
c47242	We are <i>thine:</i>
c47243	thou never barest rule
c47244	over them; they were not called by thy name.
c47245	Oh that thou wouldest rend the heavens,
c47246	that thou wouldest come down,
c47247	that the mountains might flow down at thy presence,
c47248	As <i>when</i> the melting fire burneth,
c47249	the fire causeth the waters to boil,
c47250	to make thy name known to thine adversaries,
c47251	<i>that</i> the nations may tremble at thy presence!
c47252	When thou didst terrible things
c47253	<i>which</i> we looked not for,
c47254	thou camest down,
c47255	the mountains flowed down at thy presence.
c47256	For since the beginning of the world <i>men</i> have not heard,
c47257	nor perceived by the ear,
c47258	neither hath the eye seen, O God, beside
c47259	thee, <i>what</i> he hath prepared
c47260	for him that waiteth for him.
c47261	Thou meetest him that rejoiceth and worketh righteousness,
c47262	<i>those that</i> remember thee in thy ways:
c47263	behold, thou art wroth;
c47264	for we have sinned: in those is continuance,
c47265	and we shall be saved.
c47266	But we are all as an unclean
c47267	<i>thing,</i> and all our righteousnesses <i>are</i> as filthy rags;
c47268	and we all do fade as a leaf;
c47269	and our iniquities, like the wind, have taken us away.
c47270	And <i>there is</i> none that calleth upon thy name,
c47271	that stirreth up himself
c47272	to take hold
c47273	of thee: for thou hast hid thy face from
c47274	us, and hast consumed us, because of our iniquities.
c47275	But now,
c47276	O LORD,
c47277	thou <i>art</i> our father;
c47278	we <i>are</i> the clay,
c47279	and thou our potter;
c47280	and we all <i>are</i> the work of thy hand.
c47281	Be not wroth
c47282	O LORD,
c47283	very sore,
c47284	neither remember iniquity for ever:
c47285	behold, see, we beseech thee,
c47286	we <i>are</i> all thy people.
c47287	Thy holy cities are a wilderness,
c47288	Zion is a wilderness,
c47289	Jerusalem a desolation.
c47290	Our holy and our beautiful house,
c47291	where our fathers praised
c47292	thee, is burned up with fire:
c47293	and all our pleasant things are laid waste.
c47294	Wilt thou refrain thyself for these
c47295	<i>things,</i> O LORD?
c47296	wilt thou hold thy peace,
c47297	and afflict us very sore?
c47298	I am sought
c47299	of <i>them that</i> asked not
c47300	<i>for me;</i> I am found
c47301	of <i>them that</i> sought me not:
c47302	I said,
c47303	Behold
c47304	me, behold
c47305	me, unto a nation
c47306	<i>that</i> was not called by my name.
c47307	I have spread out my hands all the day unto a rebellious people,
c47308	which walketh in a way
c47309	<i>that was</i> not good,
c47310	after their own thoughts;
c47311	A people
c47312	that provoketh me to anger continually to my face;
c47313	that sacrificeth in gardens,
c47314	and burneth incense upon altars of brick;
c47315	Which remain among the graves,
c47316	and lodge in the monuments,
c47317	which eat swine's flesh,
c47318	and broth of abominable <i>things is in</i> their vessels;
c47319	Which say,
c47320	Stand by
c47321	thyself, come not near
c47322	to me; for I am holier
c47323	than thou. These <i>are</i> a smoke in my nose,
c47324	a fire
c47325	that burneth all the day.
c47326	Behold, <i>it is</i> written before
c47327	me: I will not keep silence,
c47328	but will recompense,
c47329	even recompense into their bosom,
c47330	Your iniquities, and the iniquities of your fathers together,
c47331	saith the LORD,
c47332	which have burned incense upon the mountains,
c47333	and blasphemed me upon the hills:
c47334	therefore will I measure their former work into their bosom.
c47335	Thus saith the LORD,
c47336	As the new wine is found in the cluster,
c47337	and <i>one</i> saith,
c47338	Destroy it not;
c47339	for a blessing
c47340	<i>is</i> in it: so will I do for my servants' sakes,
c47341	that I may not destroy them all.
c47342	And I will bring forth a seed out of Jacob,
c47343	and out of Judah an inheritor of my mountains:
c47344	and mine elect shall inherit
c47345	it, and my servants shall dwell there.
c47346	And Sharon shall be a fold of flocks,
c47347	and the valley of Achor a place for the herds to lie down in, for my people
c47348	that have sought me.
c47349	But ye
c47350	<i>are</i> they that forsake the LORD,
c47351	that forget my holy mountain,
c47352	that prepare a table for that troop,
c47353	and that furnish the drink offering unto that number.
c47354	Therefore will I number you to the sword,
c47355	and ye shall all bow down to the slaughter:
c47356	because when I called,
c47357	ye did not answer;
c47358	when I spake,
c47359	ye did not hear;
c47360	but did evil before mine eyes,
c47362	<i>that</i> wherein I delighted not.
c47363	and did choose
c47364	Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD,
c47365	Behold, my servants shall eat,
c47366	but ye shall be hungry:
c47367	behold, my servants shall drink,
c47368	but ye shall be thirsty:
c47369	behold, my servants shall rejoice,
c47370	but ye shall be ashamed:
c47371	Behold, my servants shall sing for joy of heart,
c47372	but ye shall cry for sorrow of heart,
c47373	and shall howl for vexation of spirit.
c47374	And ye shall leave your name for a curse unto my chosen:
c47375	for the Lord GOD shall slay
c47376	thee, and call his servants by another name:
c47377	That he who
c47378	blesseth himself in the earth
c47379	shall bless himself in the God of truth;
c47381	and he that sweareth in the earth
c47382	shall swear by the God of truth;
c47383	because the former troubles are forgotten,
c47384	and because they are hid from mine eyes.
c47385	For, behold, I create new heavens and a new earth:
c47386	and the former shall not be remembered,
c47387	nor come into mind.
c47388	But be ye glad
c47389	and rejoice for ever
c47390	<i>in that</i> which I create:
c47391	for, behold, I create Jerusalem a rejoicing,
c47392	and her people a joy.
c47393	And I will rejoice in Jerusalem,
c47394	and joy in my people:
c47395	and the voice of weeping shall be no more heard in her, nor the voice of crying.
c47396	There shall be no more thence an infant of days, nor an old man
c47397	that hath not filled his days:
c47398	for the child shall die an hundred years old;
c47399	but the sinner <i>being</i> an hundred years old shall be accursed.
c47400	And they shall build houses,
c47401	and inhabit
c47402	<i>them;</i> and they shall plant vineyards,
c47403	and eat the fruit of them.
c47404	They shall not build,
c47405	and another inhabit;
c47406	they shall not plant,
c47407	and another eat:
c47408	for as the days of a tree <i>are</i> the days of my people,
c47409	and mine elect shall long enjoy the work of their hands.
c47410	They shall not labour in vain,
c47411	nor bring forth for trouble;
c47412	for they <i>are</i> the seed of the blessed of the LORD,
c47413	and their offspring with them.
c47414	And it shall come to pass,
c47415	that before they call,
c47416	I will answer;
c47417	and while they are yet speaking,
c47418	I will hear.
c47419	The wolf and the lamb shall feed together,
c47420	and the lion shall eat straw like the bullock:
c47422	and dust <i>shall be</i> the serpent's meat.
c47423	They shall not hurt
c47424	nor destroy in all my holy mountain,
c47425	saith the LORD.
c47426	Thus saith the LORD,
c47427	The heaven <i>is</i> my throne,
c47428	and the earth <i>is</i> my footstool:
c47429	where <i>is</i> the house that ye build
c47431	unto me? and where <i>is</i> the place of my rest?
c47432	For all those <i>things</i> hath mine hand made,
c47433	and all those <i>things</i> have been,
c47434	saith the LORD:
c47435	but to this <i>man</i> will I look,
c47436	<i>even</i> to <i>him that is</i> poor and of a contrite spirit, and trembleth at my word.
c47437	He that killeth an ox
c47438	<i>is as if</i> he slew a man;
c47439	he that sacrificeth a lamb,
c47440	<i>as if</i> he cut off a dog's neck;
c47441	he that offereth an oblation,
c47442	<i>as if he offered</i> swine's blood;
c47443	he that burneth incense,
c47444	<i>as if</i> he blessed an idol.
c47445	Yea, they have chosen their own ways,
c47446	and their soul delighteth in their abominations.
c47447	I also will choose their delusions,
c47448	and will bring their fears
c47449	upon them; because when I called,
c47450	none did answer;
c47451	when I spake,
c47452	they did not hear:
c47453	but they did evil before mine eyes,
c47455	<i>that</i> in which I delighted not.
c47456	and chose
c47457	Hear the word of the LORD,
c47458	ye that tremble at his word;
c47459	Your brethren that hated
c47461	you, that cast you out for my name's sake, said,
c47462	Let the LORD be glorified:
c47463	but he shall appear to your joy,
c47464	and they shall be ashamed.
c47465	A voice of noise from the city,
c47466	a voice from the temple,
c47467	a voice of the LORD
c47468	that rendereth recompence to his enemies.
c47469	Before she travailed,
c47470	she brought forth;
c47471	before her pain came,
c47472	she was delivered of a man child.
c47473	Who hath heard such a thing?
c47474	who hath seen such things?
c47475	Shall the earth be made to bring forth in one day?
c47476	<i>or</i> shall a nation be born at once?
c47477	for as soon as Zion travailed,
c47478	she brought forth her children.
c47479	Shall I bring to the birth,
c47480	and not cause to bring forth?
c47481	saith the LORD:
c47482	shall I cause to bring forth,
c47483	and shut
c47484	<i>the womb?</i> saith thy God.
c47485	Rejoice ye with Jerusalem,
c47486	and be glad
c47487	with her, all ye that love
c47488	her: rejoice for joy with
c47489	her, all
c47490	ye that mourn for her:
c47491	That ye may suck,
c47492	and be satisfied with the breasts of her consolations;
c47493	that ye may milk out,
c47494	and be delighted with the abundance of her glory.
c47495	For thus saith the LORD,
c47496	Behold, I will extend peace to her like a river,
c47497	and the glory of the Gentiles like a flowing stream:
c47498	then shall ye suck,
c47499	ye shall be borne upon <i>her</i> sides,
c47500	and be dandled upon <i>her</i> knees.
c47501	As one
c47502	whom his mother comforteth,
c47503	so will I comfort
c47504	you; and ye shall be comforted in Jerusalem.
c47505	And when ye see
c47506	<i>this,</i> your heart shall rejoice,
c47507	and your bones shall flourish like an herb:
c47508	and the hand of the LORD shall be known toward his servants,
c47509	and <i>his</i> indignation toward his enemies.
c47510	For, behold, the LORD will come with fire,
c47511	and with his chariots like a whirlwind,
c47512	to render his anger with fury,
c47513	and his rebuke with flames of fire.
c47514	For by fire and by his sword will the LORD plead
c47515	with all flesh:
c47516	and the slain of the LORD shall be many.
c47517	They that sanctify themselves,
c47518	and purify themselves in the gardens behind one <i>tree</i> in the midst,
c47519	eating swine's flesh, and the abomination, and the mouse,
c47520	shall be consumed together,
c47521	saith the LORD.
c47522	For I
c47523	<i>know</i> their works and their thoughts:
c47524	it shall come,
c47525	that I will gather all nations and tongues;
c47526	and they shall come,
c47527	and see my glory.
c47528	And I will set a sign
c47529	among them, and I will send those that escape of them unto the nations, <i>to</i> Tarshish, Pul, and Lud, that draw the bow, <i>to</i> Tubal, and Javan, <i>to</i> the isles afar off,
c47530	that have not heard my fame,
c47531	neither have seen my glory;
c47532	and they shall declare my glory among the Gentiles.
c47533	And they shall bring all your brethren <i>for</i> an offering unto the LORD out of all nations upon horses, and in chariots, and in litters, and upon mules, and upon swift beasts, to my holy mountain Jerusalem,
c47534	saith the LORD,
c47535	as the children of Israel bring an offering in a clean vessel into the house of the LORD.
c47536	And I will also take of them for priests <i>and</i> for Levites,
c47537	saith the LORD.
c47538	For
c47539	as the new heavens and the new earth,
c47540	which I will make,
c47541	shall remain before
c47542	me, saith the LORD,
c47543	so shall your seed and your name remain.
c47544	And it shall come to pass,
c47545	<i>that</i> from one new moon to another, and from one sabbath to another, shall all flesh come
c47546	to worship before
c47547	me, saith the LORD.
c47548	And they shall go forth,
c47549	and look upon the carcases of the men
c47550	that have transgressed
c47551	against me: for their worm shall not die,
c47552	neither shall their fire be quenched;
c47553	and they shall be an abhorring unto all flesh.
c47554	The words of Jeremiah the son of Hilkiah, of the priests
c47555	that <i>were</i> in Anathoth in the land of Benjamin:
c47556	To whom the word of the LORD came in the days of Josiah the son of Amon king of Judah, in the thirteenth year
c47557	of his reign.
c47558	It came also in the days of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah,
c47559	unto the end of the eleventh year of Zedekiah the son of Josiah king of Judah,
c47560	unto the carrying away of Jerusalem captive in the fifth month.
c47561	Then the word of the LORD came unto
c47562	me, saying,
c47563	Before I formed thee in the belly
c47564	I knew
c47565	thee; and before thou camest forth out of the womb
c47566	I sanctified
c47567	thee, <i>and</i> I ordained thee a prophet unto the nations.
c47568	Then said
c47569	I, Ah, Lord GOD!
c47570	behold, I cannot
c47571	speak:
c47572	for I <i>am</i> a child.
c47573	But the LORD said unto
c47574	me, Say not,
c47575	I <i>am</i> a child:
c47576	for thou shalt go to all
c47577	that I shall send
c47579	thee, and whatsoever
c47580	I command
c47581	thee thou shalt speak.
c47582	Be not afraid of their faces:
c47583	for I <i>am</i> with
c47584	thee to deliver
c47585	thee, saith the LORD.
c47586	Then the LORD put forth his hand,
c47587	and touched my mouth.
c47588	And the LORD said unto
c47589	me, Behold, I have put my words in thy mouth.
c47590	See,
c47591	I have this day set thee over the nations and over the kingdoms,
c47592	to root out,
c47593	and to pull down,
c47594	and to destroy,
c47595	and to throw down,
c47596	to build,
c47597	and to plant.
c47598	Moreover the word of the LORD came unto
c47599	me, saying,
c47600	what seest thou?
c47601	Jeremiah,
c47602	And I said,
c47603	I see a rod of an almond tree.
c47604	Then said the LORD unto
c47605	me, Thou hast well
c47606	seen:
c47607	for I will hasten my word
c47608	to perform it.
c47609	And the word of the LORD came unto me the second time,
c47610	saying,
c47611	What seest thou?
c47612	And I said,
c47613	I see a seething pot;
c47614	and the face thereof <i>is</i> toward the north.
c47615	Then the LORD said unto
c47616	me, Out of the north an evil shall break forth upon all the inhabitants of the land.
c47617	For, lo, I will call all the families of the kingdoms of the north,
c47618	saith the LORD;
c47619	and they shall come,
c47620	and they shall set
c47621	every one his throne
c47622	at the entering of the gates of Jerusalem, and against all the walls thereof round about, and against all the cities of Judah.
c47623	And I will utter my judgments against them touching all their wickedness,
c47624	who have forsaken
c47625	me, and have burned incense unto other gods,
c47626	and worshipped the works of their own hands.
c47627	Thou therefore gird up thy loins,
c47628	and arise,
c47629	and speak unto them all
c47630	that I command
c47631	thee: be not dismayed at their faces,
c47632	lest I confound thee before them.
c47633	For,
c47634	behold, I have made thee this day a defenced city, and an iron pillar, and brasen walls against the whole land, against the kings of Judah, against the princes thereof, against the priests thereof, and against the people of the land.
c47635	And they shall fight against
c47636	thee; but they shall not prevail
c47637	against thee; for I <i>am</i> with
c47638	thee, saith the LORD,
c47639	to deliver thee.
c47640	Moreover the word of the LORD came to
c47641	me, saying,
c47642	Go
c47643	and cry in the ears of Jerusalem,
c47644	saying,
c47645	Thus saith the LORD;
c47646	I remember thee, the kindness of thy youth, the love of thine espousals,
c47647	when thou wentest after me in the wilderness, in a land
c47648	<i>that was</i> not sown.
c47649	Israel <i>was</i> holiness unto the LORD,
c47650	<i>and</i> the firstfruits of his increase:
c47651	all that devour him shall offend;
c47652	evil shall come upon
c47653	them, saith the LORD.
c47654	Hear ye the word of the LORD,
c47655	O house of Jacob, and all the families of the house of Israel:
c47656	Thus saith the LORD,
c47657	What iniquity have your fathers found
c47658	in me, that they are gone far from
c47659	me, and have walked after vanity,
c47660	and are become vain?
c47661	Neither said
c47662	they, Where <i>is</i> the LORD
c47663	that brought us up out of the land of Egypt,
c47664	that led us through the wilderness, through a land of deserts and of pits, through a land of drought, and of the shadow of death, through a land
c47665	that no man passed through,
c47666	and where no man dwelt?
c47667	And I brought you into a plentiful country,
c47668	to eat the fruit thereof and the goodness
c47669	thereof; but when ye entered,
c47670	ye defiled my land,
c47671	and made mine heritage an abomination.
c47672	The priests said not,
c47673	Where <i>is</i> the LORD?
c47674	and they that handle the law knew me not:
c47675	the pastors also transgressed
c47676	against me, and the prophets prophesied by Baal,
c47678	after <i>things that</i> do not profit.
c47679	and walked
c47680	Wherefore I will yet plead with
c47681	you, saith the LORD,
c47682	and with your children's children will I plead.
c47683	For pass over the isles of Chittim,
c47684	and see;
c47685	and send unto Kedar,
c47686	and consider diligently,
c47687	and see
c47688	if there be such a thing.
c47689	Hath a nation changed <i>their</i> gods,
c47690	which <i>are</i> yet no gods?
c47691	but my people have changed their glory
c47692	for <i>that which</i> doth not profit.
c47693	Be astonished,
c47694	O ye heavens,
c47695	at this,
c47696	and be horribly afraid,
c47697	be ye very desolate,
c47698	saith the LORD.
c47699	For my people have committed two evils;
c47700	they have forsaken me the fountain of living waters,
c47701	<i>and</i> hewed them out cisterns, broken cisterns,
c47702	that can hold no water.
c47703	<i>Is</i> Israel a servant?
c47704	<i>is</i> he a homeborn
c47705	<i>slave?</i> why is he spoiled?
c47706	The young lions roared upon
c47707	him, <i>and</i> yelled,
c47708	and they made his land waste:
c47709	his cities are burned without inhabitant.
c47710	Also the children of Noph and Tahapanes have broken the crown of thy head.
c47711	Hast thou not procured this
c47712	unto thyself, in that thou hast forsaken the LORD thy God, when
c47713	he led thee by the way?
c47714	And now
c47715	what hast thou to do in the way of Egypt,
c47716	to drink the waters of Sihor?
c47717	or what hast thou to do in the way of Assyria,
c47718	to drink the waters of the river?
c47719	Thine own wickedness shall correct
c47720	thee, and thy backslidings shall reprove
c47721	thee: know
c47722	therefore and see
c47723	that <i>it is</i> an evil
c47724	<i>thing</i> and bitter,
c47725	that thou hast forsaken the LORD thy God,
c47726	and that my fear <i>is</i> not in
c47727	thee, saith the Lord GOD of hosts.
c47728	For of old time I have broken thy yoke,
c47729	<i>and</i> burst thy bands;
c47730	and thou saidst,
c47731	I will not transgress;
c47732	when upon every high hill and under every green tree thou wanderest,
c47733	playing the harlot.
c47734	Yet I had planted thee a noble vine,
c47735	wholly a right seed:
c47736	how then art thou turned into the degenerate plant of a strange vine unto me?
c47737	For though thou wash thee with nitre,
c47738	and take thee much soap,
c47739	<i>yet</i> thine iniquity is marked before
c47740	me, saith the Lord GOD.
c47741	How canst thou say,
c47742	I am not polluted,
c47743	I have not gone after Baalim?
c47744	see thy way in the valley,
c47745	know
c47746	what thou hast done:
c47747	<i>thou art</i> a swift dromedary
c47748	traversing her ways;
c47749	A wild ass
c47750	used to the wilderness,
c47751	<i>that</i> snuffeth up the wind at her pleasure;
c47752	in her occasion
c47753	who can turn her away?
c47754	all they that seek her will not weary
c47755	themselves; in her month they shall find her.
c47756	Withhold thy foot from being unshod,
c47757	and thy throat from thirst:
c47758	but thou saidst,
c47759	There is no hope:
c47760	no;
c47761	for I have loved strangers,
c47762	and after them will I go.
c47763	As the thief is ashamed
c47764	when he is found,
c47765	so is the house of Israel ashamed; they, their kings, their princes, and their priests, and their prophets,
c47766	Saying to a stock,
c47767	Thou <i>art</i> my father;
c47768	and to a stone,
c47769	Thou hast brought me forth:
c47770	for they have turned <i>their</i> back unto
c47771	me, and not <i>their</i> face:
c47772	but in the time of their trouble they will say,
c47773	Arise,
c47774	and save us.
c47775	But where <i>are</i> thy gods
c47776	that thou hast made
c47777	thee? let them arise,
c47778	if they can save thee in the time of thy trouble:
c47779	for <i>according to</i> the number of thy cities are thy gods,
c47780	O Judah.
c47781	Wherefore will ye plead with
c47782	me? ye all have transgressed
c47783	against me, saith the LORD.
c47784	In vain have I smitten your children;
c47785	they received no correction:
c47786	your own sword hath devoured your prophets, like a destroying lion.
c47787	O generation,
c47788	see ye the word of the LORD.
c47789	Have I been a wilderness unto Israel?
c47790	a land of darkness?
c47791	wherefore say my people,
c47792	We are lords;
c47793	we will come no more unto thee?
c47794	Can a maid forget her ornaments,
c47795	<i>or</i> a bride her attire?
c47796	yet my people have forgotten me days
c47797	without number.
c47798	Why trimmest thou thy way
c47799	to seek love?
c47800	therefore hast thou also taught the wicked ones thy ways.
c47801	Also in thy skirts is found the blood of the souls of the poor innocents:
c47802	I have not found it by secret search,
c47803	but upon all these.
c47804	Yet thou sayest,
c47805	Because I am innocent,
c47806	surely his anger shall turn from
c47807	me. Behold, I will plead with
c47808	thee, because thou sayest,
c47809	I have not sinned.
c47810	Why gaddest thou about so much
c47811	to change thy way?
c47812	thou also shalt be ashamed of Egypt,
c47813	as thou wast ashamed of Assyria.
c47814	Yea, thou shalt go forth from him,
c47815	and thine hands upon thine head:
c47816	for the LORD hath rejected thy confidences,
c47817	and thou shalt not prosper in them.
c47818	They say,
c47819	If a man put away his wife,
c47820	and she go from
c47821	him, and become another man's,
c47822	shall he return unto her again?
c47823	shall not that land be greatly polluted?
c47824	but thou hast played the harlot with many lovers;
c47825	yet return again to
c47826	me, saith the LORD.
c47827	Lift up thine eyes unto the high places,
c47828	and see
c47829	where thou hast not been lien
c47830	with. In the ways hast thou sat for them, as the Arabian in the wilderness;
c47831	and thou hast polluted the land with thy whoredoms and with thy wickedness.
c47832	Therefore the showers have been withholden,
c47833	and there hath been no latter rain;
c47834	and thou hadst a whore's forehead,
c47835	thou refusedst
c47836	to be ashamed.
c47837	Wilt thou not from this time cry
c47838	unto me, My father,
c47839	thou <i>art</i> the guide of my youth?
c47840	Will he reserve <i>his anger</i> for ever?
c47841	will he keep <i>it</i> to the end?
c47842	Behold, thou hast spoken
c47843	and done evil things
c47844	as thou couldest.
c47845	The LORD said also unto me in the days of Josiah the king,
c47846	Hast thou seen
c47847	<i>that</i> which backsliding Israel hath done?
c47848	she is gone up upon every high mountain and under every green tree,
c47849	and there hath played the harlot.
c47850	And I said
c47851	after she had done all these
c47852	<i>things,</i> Turn thou unto
c47853	me. But she returned not.
c47854	And her treacherous sister Judah saw <i>it.</i>
c47855	And I saw,
c47856	when for all the causes
c47857	whereby backsliding Israel committed adultery
c47858	I had put her away,
c47859	and given her a bill of divorce;
c47860	yet her treacherous sister Judah feared not,
c47861	but went
c47862	and played the harlot also.
c47863	And it came to pass through the lightness of her whoredom,
c47864	that she defiled the land,
c47865	and committed adultery with stones and with stocks.
c47866	And yet for all this her treacherous sister Judah hath not turned unto me with her whole heart,
c47867	but feignedly,
c47868	saith the LORD.
c47869	And the LORD said unto
c47870	me, The backsliding Israel hath justified herself more than treacherous Judah.
c47871	Go
c47872	and proclaim these words toward the north,
c47873	and say,
c47874	Return,
c47875	thou backsliding Israel,
c47876	saith the LORD;
c47877	<i>and</i> I will not cause mine anger to fall
c47878	upon you: for I <i>am</i> merciful,
c47879	saith the LORD,
c47880	<i>and</i> I will not keep <i>anger</i> for ever.
c47881	Only acknowledge thine iniquity,
c47882	that thou hast transgressed against the LORD thy God,
c47883	and hast scattered thy ways to the strangers under every green tree,
c47884	and ye have not obeyed my voice,
c47885	saith the LORD.
c47886	Turn,
c47887	O backsliding children,
c47888	saith the LORD;
c47889	for I am married
c47890	unto you: and I will take you one of a city, and two of a family,
c47891	and I will bring you to Zion:
c47892	And I will give you pastors according to mine heart,
c47893	which shall feed you with knowledge and understanding.
c47894	And it shall come to pass,
c47895	when ye be multiplied
c47896	and increased in the land, in those days,
c47897	saith the LORD,
c47898	they shall say no more,
c47899	The ark of the covenant of the LORD:
c47900	neither shall it come to mind:
c47901	neither shall they remember
c47902	it; neither shall they visit
c47903	<i>it;</i> neither shall <i>that</i> be done any more.
c47904	At that time they shall call Jerusalem the throne of the LORD;
c47905	and all the nations shall be gathered unto it, to the name of the LORD, to Jerusalem:
c47906	neither shall they walk any more after the imagination of their evil heart.
c47907	In those days the house of Judah shall walk with the house of Israel,
c47908	and they shall come together out of the land of the north to the land
c47909	that I have given for an inheritance unto your fathers.
c47910	But I said,
c47911	How shall I put thee among the children,
c47912	and give thee a pleasant land, a goodly heritage of the hosts of nations?
c47913	and I said,
c47914	Thou shalt call me, My father;
c47915	and shalt not turn away from me.
c47916	Surely <i>as</i> a wife treacherously departeth from her husband,
c47917	so have ye dealt treacherously
c47918	with me, O house of Israel,
c47919	saith the LORD.
c47920	A voice was heard upon the high places,
c47921	weeping <i>and</i> supplications of the children of Israel:
c47922	for they have perverted their way,
c47923	<i>and</i> they have forgotten the LORD their God.
c47924	Return,
c47925	ye backsliding children,
c47926	<i>and</i> I will heal your backslidings.
c47927	Behold,
c47928	we come
c47929	unto thee; for thou <i>art</i> the LORD our God.
c47930	Truly in vain <i>is salvation hoped for</i> from the hills, <i>and from</i> the multitude of mountains:
c47931	truly in the LORD our God <i>is</i> the salvation of Israel.
c47932	For shame hath devoured the labour of our fathers from our youth; their flocks and their herds, their sons and their daughters.
c47933	We lie down in our shame,
c47934	and our confusion covereth
c47935	us: for we have sinned against the LORD our God,
c47936	we and our fathers, from our youth even unto this day,
c47937	and have not obeyed the voice of the LORD our God.
c47938	If thou wilt return,
c47939	O Israel,
c47940	saith the LORD,
c47941	return unto
c47942	me: and if thou wilt put away thine abominations out of my sight,
c47943	then shalt thou not remove.
c47944	And thou shalt swear,
c47945	The LORD liveth,
c47946	in truth, in judgment, and in righteousness;
c47947	and the nations shall bless themselves
c47948	in him, and in him shall they glory.
c47949	For thus saith the LORD to the men of Judah and Jerusalem,
c47950	Break up your fallow ground,
c47951	and sow not among thorns.
c47952	Circumcise yourselves to the LORD,
c47953	and take away the foreskins of your heart,
c47954	ye men of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem:
c47955	lest my fury come forth like fire,
c47956	and burn
c47957	that none can quench
c47958	<i>it,</i> because of the evil of your doings.
c47959	Declare ye in Judah,
c47960	and publish in Jerusalem;
c47961	and say,
c47962	Blow ye the trumpet in the land:
c47963	cry,
c47964	gather together,
c47965	and say,
c47966	Assemble yourselves,
c47967	and let us go into the defenced cities.
c47968	Set up the standard toward Zion:
c47969	retire,
c47970	stay not:
c47971	for I will bring evil from the north, and a great destruction.
c47972	The lion is come up from his thicket,
c47973	and the destroyer of the Gentiles is on his way;
c47974	he is gone forth from his place
c47975	to make thy land desolate;
c47976	<i>and</i> thy cities shall be laid waste, without an inhabitant.
c47977	For this gird you with sackcloth,
c47978	lament
c47979	and howl:
c47980	for the fierce anger of the LORD is not turned back from us.
c47981	And it shall come to pass at that day,
c47982	saith the LORD,
c47983	<i>that</i> the heart of the king shall perish, and the heart of the princes;
c47984	and the priests shall be astonished,
c47985	and the prophets shall wonder.
c47986	Then said
c47987	I, Ah,
c47988	Lord GOD!
c47989	surely thou hast greatly deceived this people and Jerusalem,
c47990	saying,
c47991	Ye shall have peace;
c47992	whereas the sword reacheth unto the soul.
c47993	At that time shall it be said to this people and to Jerusalem,
c47994	A dry wind of the high places in the wilderness toward the daughter of my people,
c47995	not
c47996	to fan,
c47997	nor
c47998	to cleanse,
c47999	<i>Even</i> a full wind from those <i>places</i> shall come
c48000	unto me: now also will I give sentence against them.
c48001	Behold, he shall come up as clouds,
c48002	and his chariots <i>shall be</i> as a whirlwind:
c48003	his horses are swifter than eagles.
c48004	Woe
c48005	unto us! for we are spoiled.
c48006	wash thine heart from wickedness,
c48007	O Jerusalem,
c48008	that thou mayest be saved.
c48009	How long shall thy vain thoughts lodge within thee?
c48010	For a voice declareth from Dan,
c48011	and publisheth affliction from mount Ephraim.
c48012	Make ye mention to the nations;
c48013	behold, publish against Jerusalem,
c48014	<i>that</i> watchers come from a far country,
c48015	and give out their voice against the cities of Judah.
c48016	As keepers of a field, are they against her round about;
c48017	because she hath been rebellious
c48018	against me, saith the LORD.
c48019	Thy way and thy doings have procured these
c48020	<i>things</i> unto thee; this <i>is</i> thy wickedness,
c48021	because it is bitter,
c48022	because it reacheth unto thine heart.
c48023	My bowels, my bowels!
c48024	I am pained
c48025	at my very heart;
c48026	my heart maketh a noise
c48027	in me; I cannot hold my peace,
c48028	because thou hast heard, O my soul, the sound of the trumpet,
c48030	the alarm of war.
c48031	Destruction upon destruction is cried;
c48032	for the whole land is spoiled:
c48033	suddenly are my tents spoiled,
c48034	<i>and</i> my curtains in a moment.
c48035	How long shall I see the standard,
c48036	<i>and</i> hear the sound of the trumpet?
c48037	For my people <i>is</i> foolish,
c48038	they have not known
c48039	me; they <i>are</i> sottish children,
c48040	and they have none understanding:
c48041	they <i>are</i> wise
c48042	to do evil,
c48044	but to do good
c48045	they have no knowledge.
c48046	I beheld the earth,
c48047	and, lo, <i>it was</i> without form, and void;
c48048	and the heavens,
c48049	and they <i>had</i> no light.
c48050	I beheld the mountains,
c48051	and, lo, they trembled,
c48052	and all the hills moved lightly.
c48053	I beheld,
c48054	and, lo, <i>there was</i> no man,
c48055	and all the birds of the heavens were fled.
c48056	I beheld,
c48057	and, lo, the fruitful place <i>was</i> a wilderness,
c48058	and all the cities thereof were broken down at the presence of the LORD, <i>and</i> by his fierce anger.
c48059	For thus hath the LORD said,
c48060	The whole land shall be desolate;
c48061	yet will I not make a full end.
c48062	For this shall the earth mourn,
c48063	and the heavens above be black:
c48064	because I have spoken
c48065	<i>it,</i> I have purposed
c48066	<i>it,</i> and will not repent,
c48067	neither will I turn back from it.
c48068	The whole city shall flee for the noise of the horsemen and bowmen;
c48069	they shall go into thickets,
c48070	and climb up upon the rocks:
c48071	every city <i>shall be</i> forsaken,
c48072	and not a man dwell therein.
c48073	And <i>when</i> thou
c48074	<i>art</i> spoiled,
c48075	what wilt thou do?
c48076	Though thou clothest thyself with crimson,
c48077	though thou deckest thee with ornaments of gold,
c48078	though thou rentest thy face with painting,
c48079	in vain shalt thou make thyself fair;
c48080	<i>thy</i> lovers will despise
c48081	thee, they will seek thy life.
c48082	For I have heard a voice as of a woman in travail,
c48083	<i>and</i> the anguish as of her that bringeth forth her first child,
c48084	the voice of the daughter of Zion, <i>that</i> bewaileth herself,
c48085	<i>that</i> spreadeth her hands,
c48086	<i>saying,</i> Woe <i>is</i> me now!
c48087	for my soul is wearied because of murderers.
c48088	Run ye to and fro through the streets of Jerusalem,
c48089	and see now,
c48090	and know,
c48091	and seek in the broad places
c48092	thereof, if ye can find a man,
c48093	if there be
c48094	<i>any</i> that executeth judgment,
c48095	that seeketh the truth;
c48096	and I will pardon it.
c48097	And though
c48098	The LORD liveth;
c48099	they say,
c48100	surely they swear falsely.
c48101	O LORD,
c48103	<i>are</i> not thine eyes upon the truth?
c48104	thou hast stricken
c48105	them, but they have not grieved;
c48106	thou hast consumed
c48107	them, <i>but</i> they have refused
c48108	to receive correction:
c48109	they have made their faces harder than a rock;
c48110	they have refused
c48111	to return.
c48112	Therefore I said,
c48113	Surely these <i>are</i> poor;
c48114	they are foolish:
c48115	for they know not the way of the LORD,
c48116	<i>nor</i> the judgment of their God.
c48117	I will get me unto the great men,
c48118	and will speak unto
c48119	them; for they have known the way of the LORD,
c48120	<i>and</i> the judgment of their God:
c48121	but these have altogether broken the yoke,
c48122	<i>and</i> burst the bonds.
c48123	Wherefore a lion out of the forest shall slay
c48124	them, <i>and</i> a wolf of the evenings shall spoil
c48125	them, a leopard shall watch over their cities:
c48126	every one
c48127	that goeth out thence
c48128	shall be torn in pieces:
c48129	because their transgressions are many,
c48130	<i>and</i> their backslidings are increased.
c48131	How shall I pardon thee for this?
c48132	thy children have forsaken
c48133	me, and sworn by <i>them that are</i> no gods:
c48134	when I had fed them to the full,
c48135	they then committed adultery,
c48136	and assembled themselves by troops in the harlots' houses.
c48137	They were <i>as</i> fed horses in the morning:
c48138	every one neighed after his neighbour's wife.
c48140	Shall I not visit for these
c48141	<i>things?</i> saith the LORD:
c48142	and shall not my soul be avenged
c48143	on such a nation as this?
c48145	Go ye up upon her walls,
c48146	and destroy;
c48147	but make not a full end:
c48148	take away her battlements;
c48149	for they <i>are</i> not the LORD'S.
c48150	For the house of Israel and the house of Judah have dealt very treacherously
c48151	against me, saith the LORD.
c48152	They have belied the LORD,
c48153	and said,
c48154	<i>It is</i> not he;
c48155	neither shall evil come upon
c48156	us; neither shall we see sword nor famine:
c48157	And the prophets shall become wind,
c48159	and the word
c48160	<i>is</i> not
c48161	in them: thus shall it be done unto them.
c48162	Wherefore
c48163	thus saith the LORD God of hosts,
c48164	Because ye speak this word,
c48165	behold, I will make my words in thy mouth fire,
c48166	and this people wood,
c48167	and it shall devour them.
c48168	Lo, I will bring a nation upon you from far,
c48169	O house of Israel,
c48170	saith the LORD:
c48171	it <i>is</i> a mighty nation,
c48172	it <i>is</i> an ancient nation,
c48173	a nation
c48174	whose language thou knowest not,
c48175	neither understandest
c48176	what they say.
c48177	Their quiver <i>is</i> as an open sepulchre,
c48178	they <i>are</i> all mighty men.
c48179	And they shall eat up thine harvest, and thy bread,
c48180	<i>which</i> thy sons and thy daughters should eat:
c48181	they shall eat up thy flocks and thine herds:
c48182	they shall eat up thy vines and thy fig trees:
c48183	they shall impoverish thy fenced cities,
c48184	wherein thou trustedst,
c48185	with the sword.
c48186	Nevertheless in those days,
c48187	saith the LORD,
c48188	I will not make a full end with you.
c48189	And it shall come to pass,
c48190	when ye shall say,
c48191	Wherefore doeth the LORD our God all these
c48192	<i>things</i> unto us? then shalt thou answer
c48193	them, Like as ye have forsaken
c48194	me, and served strange gods in your land,
c48195	so shall ye serve strangers in a land
c48196	<i>that is</i> not yours.
c48197	Declare this in the house of Jacob,
c48198	and publish it in Judah,
c48199	saying,
c48200	Hear now this,
c48201	O foolish people, and without understanding;
c48202	which have eyes,
c48203	and see not;
c48204	which have ears,
c48205	and hear not:
c48206	Fear ye not
c48207	me? saith the LORD:
c48208	will ye not tremble at my presence,
c48209	which have placed the sand <i>for</i> the bound of the sea
c48210	by a perpetual decree,
c48211	that it cannot pass
c48213	yet can they not prevail; though they roar,
c48214	it: and though the waves thereof toss themselves,
c48215	yet can they not pass over it?
c48216	But this people hath a revolting and a rebellious heart;
c48217	they are revolted
c48218	and gone.
c48219	Neither say they in their heart,
c48220	Let us now fear the LORD our God,
c48221	that giveth rain, both the former and the latter, in his season:
c48222	he reserveth unto us the appointed weeks of the harvest.
c48223	Your iniquities have turned away these
c48224	<i>things,</i> and your sins have withholden good <i>things</i> from you.
c48225	For among my people are found wicked
c48226	<i>men:</i> they lay wait,
c48227	as he that setteth snares;
c48228	they set a trap,
c48229	they catch men.
c48230	As a cage
c48231	is full of birds,
c48232	so <i>are</i> their houses full of deceit:
c48233	therefore they are become great,
c48234	and waxen rich.
c48235	They are waxen fat,
c48236	they shine:
c48237	yea, they overpass the deeds of the wicked:
c48238	they judge not the cause,
c48239	the cause of the fatherless,
c48240	yet they prosper;
c48241	and the right of the needy do they not judge.
c48242	Shall I not visit for these
c48243	<i>things?</i> saith the LORD:
c48245	on such a nation as this?
c48246	shall not my soul be avenged
c48247	A wonderful and horrible thing is committed in the land;
c48248	The prophets prophesy falsely,
c48249	and the priests bear rule by their means;
c48250	and my people love <i>to have it</i> so:
c48251	and what will ye do in the end thereof?
c48252	gather yourselves to flee
c48253	O ye children of Benjamin,
c48254	out of the midst of Jerusalem,
c48255	and blow the trumpet in Tekoa,
c48256	and set up a sign of fire in Bethhaccerem:
c48257	for evil appeareth out of the north,
c48258	and great destruction.
c48259	I have likened the daughter of Zion to a comely and delicate <i>woman.</i>
c48261	The shepherds with their flocks shall come unto
c48262	her; they shall pitch <i>their</i> tents against her round about;
c48263	they shall feed
c48264	every one in his place.
c48265	Prepare ye war against
c48266	her; arise,
c48267	and let us go up at noon.
c48268	Woe
c48269	unto us! for the day goeth away,
c48270	for the shadows of the evening are stretched out.
c48271	Arise,
c48272	and let us go by night,
c48273	and let us destroy her palaces.
c48274	For thus hath the LORD of hosts said,
c48275	Hew ye down trees,
c48276	and cast a mount against Jerusalem:
c48277	this <i>is</i> the city
c48278	to be visited;
c48279	she <i>is</i> wholly
c48280	oppression in the midst of her.
c48281	As a fountain casteth out her waters,
c48282	so she casteth out her wickedness:
c48283	violence and spoil is heard
c48284	in her; before me continually <i>is</i> grief and wounds.
c48285	Be thou instructed,
c48286	O Jerusalem,
c48287	lest my soul depart from
c48288	thee; lest I make thee desolate,
c48289	a land
c48290	not inhabited.
c48291	Thus saith the LORD of hosts,
c48292	They shall throughly glean the remnant of Israel as a vine:
c48293	turn back thine hand as a grapegatherer into the baskets.
c48294	To whom shall I speak,
c48295	and give warning,
c48296	that they may hear?
c48297	behold, their ear <i>is</i> uncircumcised,
c48298	and they cannot
c48299	hearken:
c48300	behold, the word of the LORD is unto them a reproach;
c48301	they have no delight in it.
c48302	Therefore I am full of the fury of the LORD;
c48303	I am weary
c48304	with holding
c48305	in: I will pour it out upon the children abroad, and upon the assembly of young men together:
c48306	for even the husband with the wife shall be taken,
c48307	the aged with <i>him that is</i> full of days.
c48308	And their houses shall be turned unto others,
c48309	<i>with their</i> fields and wives together:
c48310	for I will stretch out my hand upon the inhabitants of the land,
c48311	saith the LORD.
c48312	For from the least of them even unto the greatest of them every one <i>is</i> given to covetousness;
c48313	and from the prophet even unto the priest every one dealeth falsely.
c48314	They have healed also the hurt <i>of the daughter</i> of my people slightly,
c48315	saying,
c48316	Peace, peace;
c48317	when <i>there is</i> no peace.
c48320	Were they ashamed when they had committed abomination? nay, they were not at all ashamed,
c48321	they blush:
c48322	neither could
c48323	therefore they shall fall among them that fall:
c48324	at the time
c48325	<i>that</i> I visit
c48326	them they shall be cast down,
c48327	saith the LORD.
c48328	Thus saith the LORD,
c48329	Stand ye in the ways,
c48330	and see,
c48331	and ask for the old paths,
c48332	where <i>is</i> the good way,
c48333	and walk
c48334	therein, and ye shall find rest for your souls.
c48335	But they said,
c48336	We will not walk <i>therein.</i>
c48337	Also I set watchmen over
c48338	you, <i>saying,</i> Hearken to the sound of the trumpet.
c48339	But they said,
c48340	We will not hearken.
c48341	Therefore hear,
c48342	ye nations,
c48343	and know,
c48344	O congregation,
c48345	what <i>is</i> among them.
c48346	Hear,
c48347	O earth:
c48348	behold, I will bring evil upon this people, <i>even</i> the fruit of their thoughts,
c48349	because they have not hearkened unto my words,
c48350	nor to my law,
c48351	but rejected it.
c48352	To what purpose cometh there to me incense from Sheba,
c48353	and the sweet cane from a far country?
c48354	your burnt offerings <i>are</i> not acceptable,
c48355	nor your sacrifices sweet unto me.
c48356	Therefore thus saith the LORD,
c48357	Behold, I will lay stumblingblocks before this people,
c48358	and the fathers and the sons together shall fall upon them; the neighbour and his friend
c48359	shall perish.
c48360	Thus saith the LORD,
c48361	Behold, a people cometh from the north country,
c48362	and a great nation shall be raised from the sides of the earth.
c48363	They shall lay hold on bow and spear;
c48364	they <i>are</i> cruel,
c48365	and have no mercy;
c48366	their voice roareth like the sea;
c48367	and they ride upon horses,
c48368	set in array as men for war against
c48369	thee, O daughter of Zion.
c48370	We have heard the fame
c48371	thereof: our hands wax feeble:
c48372	anguish hath taken hold
c48373	of us, <i>and</i> pain, as of a woman in travail.
c48374	Go not forth into the field,
c48375	nor walk by the way;
c48376	for the sword of the enemy
c48377	<i>and</i> fear <i>is</i> on every side.
c48378	O daughter of my people,
c48379	gird <i>thee</i> with sackcloth,
c48380	and wallow thyself in ashes:
c48381	make thee mourning, <i>as for</i> an only son, most bitter lamentation:
c48382	for the spoiler shall suddenly come upon us.
c48383	I have set thee <i>for</i> a tower <i>and</i> a fortress among my people,
c48384	that thou mayest know
c48385	and try their way.
c48386	They <i>are</i> all grievous revolters,
c48387	walking with slanders:
c48388	<i>they are</i> brass and iron;
c48390	they <i>are</i> all corrupters.
c48391	The bellows are burned, the lead is consumed of the fire;
c48392	the founder melteth in vain:
c48393	for the wicked are not plucked away.
c48394	Reprobate silver shall <i>men</i> call
c48395	them, because the LORD hath rejected them.
c48396	The word
c48397	that came to Jeremiah from the LORD,
c48398	saying,
c48399	Stand in the gate of the LORD'S house,
c48400	and proclaim there this word,
c48401	and say,
c48402	Hear the word of the LORD,
c48403	all <i>ye of</i> Judah,
c48404	that enter in at these gates
c48405	to worship the LORD.
c48406	Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel,
c48407	Amend your ways and your doings,
c48408	and I will cause you to dwell in this place.
c48409	Trust ye not in lying words,
c48410	saying,
c48411	The temple of the LORD, The temple of the LORD, The temple of the LORD, <i>are</i> these.
c48412	For if ye throughly amend your ways and your doings;
c48413	if ye throughly execute judgment between a man and his neighbour;
c48414	<i>If</i> ye oppress not the stranger, the fatherless, and the widow,
c48415	and shed not innocent blood in this place,
c48416	neither walk after other gods to your hurt:
c48417	Then will I cause you to dwell in this place, in the land
c48418	that I gave to your fathers, for ever and ever.
c48419	Behold, ye trust in lying words,
c48420	that cannot profit.
c48421	Will ye steal,
c48422	murder,
c48423	and commit adultery,
c48424	and swear falsely,
c48425	and burn incense unto Baal,
c48426	and walk after other gods
c48427	whom ye know not;
c48428	And come
c48429	and stand before me in this house,
c48430	which is called by my name,
c48431	and say,
c48432	We are delivered to do
c48433	all these abominations?
c48434	Is this house, which is called by my name, become a den of robbers
c48436	in your eyes?
c48438	Behold, even I have seen
c48439	<i>it,</i> saith the LORD.
c48440	But go ye now unto my place
c48441	which <i>was</i> in Shiloh,
c48442	where I set my name at the first,
c48443	and see
c48444	what I did to it for the wickedness of my people Israel.
c48445	And now,
c48446	because ye have done all these works,
c48447	saith the LORD,
c48448	and I spake unto
c48449	you, rising up early
c48450	and speaking,
c48451	but ye heard not;
c48452	and I called
c48453	you, but ye answered not;
c48454	Therefore will I do unto <i>this</i> house,
c48455	which is called by my name,
c48456	wherein ye trust,
c48457	and unto the place
c48458	which I gave to you and to your fathers,
c48459	as I have done to Shiloh.
c48460	And I will cast you out of my sight,
c48461	as I have cast out all your brethren, <i>even</i> the whole seed of Ephraim.
c48463	Therefore pray not thou for this people,
c48464	neither lift up cry nor prayer for
c48465	them, neither make intercession
c48466	to me: for I will not hear thee.
c48467	Seest thou not
c48468	what they do in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem?
c48469	The children gather wood,
c48470	and the fathers kindle the fire,
c48471	and the women knead <i>their</i> dough,
c48472	to make cakes to the queen of heaven,
c48473	and to pour out drink offerings unto other gods,
c48474	that they may provoke me to anger.
c48475	Do they provoke me to anger?
c48476	saith the LORD:
c48477	<i>do they</i> not <i>provoke</i> themselves to the confusion of their own faces?
c48478	Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD;
c48479	Behold, mine anger and my fury shall be poured out upon this place, upon man, and upon beast, and upon the trees of the field, and upon the fruit of the ground;
c48480	and it shall burn,
c48481	and shall not be quenched.
c48482	Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel;
c48483	Put your burnt offerings unto your sacrifices,
c48484	and eat flesh.
c48485	For I spake not unto your fathers,
c48486	nor commanded
c48487	them in the day
c48488	that I brought them out of the land of Egypt,
c48489	concerning burnt offerings or sacrifices:
c48490	But this thing commanded
c48491	I them, saying,
c48492	Obey my voice,
c48493	and I will be your God,
c48494	and ye shall be my people:
c48495	and walk ye in all the ways
c48496	that I have commanded
c48497	you, that it may be well unto you.
c48498	But they hearkened not,
c48499	nor inclined their ear,
c48500	but walked in the counsels <i>and</i> in the imagination of their evil heart,
c48501	and went backward,
c48502	and not forward.
c48503	Since the day
c48504	that your fathers came forth out of the land of Egypt
c48505	unto this day
c48506	I have even sent unto you all my servants the prophets,
c48507	daily rising up early
c48508	and sending <i>them:</i>
c48509	Yet they hearkened not unto
c48510	me, nor inclined their ear,
c48511	but hardened their neck:
c48512	they did worse than their fathers.
c48513	Therefore thou shalt speak all these words unto
c48514	them; but they will not hearken to
c48515	thee: thou shalt also call unto
c48516	them; but they will not answer thee.
c48517	But thou shalt say unto
c48518	them, This <i>is</i> a nation
c48519	that obeyeth not the voice of the LORD their God,
c48520	nor receiveth correction:
c48521	truth is perished,
c48522	and is cut off from their mouth.
c48523	Cut off thine hair,
c48524	<i>O Jerusalem,</i> and cast <i>it</i> away,
c48525	and take up a lamentation on high places;
c48526	for the LORD hath rejected
c48527	and forsaken the generation of his wrath.
c48528	For the children of Judah have done
c48529	evil in my sight,
c48530	saith the LORD:
c48531	they have set their abominations in the house
c48532	which is called by my name,
c48533	to pollute it.
c48534	And they have built the high places of Tophet,
c48535	which <i>is</i> in the valley of the son of Hinnom,
c48536	to burn their sons and their daughters in the fire;
c48537	which I commanded <i>them</i> not,
c48538	neither came it into my heart.
c48539	Therefore, behold, the days come,
c48540	saith the LORD,
c48541	that it shall no more be called Tophet, nor the valley of the son of Hinnom,
c48542	but the valley of slaughter:
c48543	for they shall bury in Tophet, till there be no place.
c48544	And the carcases of this people shall be meat for the fowls of the heaven, and for the beasts of the earth;
c48545	and none shall fray <i>them</i> away.
c48546	Then will I cause to cease from the cities of Judah, and from the streets of Jerusalem, the voice of mirth, and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the bride:
c48547	for the land shall be desolate.
c48548	At that time,
c48549	saith the LORD,
c48550	they shall bring out the bones of the kings of Judah, and the bones of his princes, and the bones of the priests, and the bones of the prophets, and the bones of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, out of their graves:
c48551	And they shall spread them before the sun, and the moon, and all the host of heaven,
c48552	whom they have loved,
c48553	and whom they have served,
c48554	and after whom they have walked,
c48555	and whom they have sought,
c48556	and whom they have worshipped:
c48557	they shall not be gathered,
c48558	nor be buried;
c48559	they shall be for dung upon the face of the earth.
c48560	And death shall be chosen rather than life by all the residue
c48561	of them that remain of this evil family,
c48562	which remain in all the places
c48563	whither I have driven
c48564	them, saith the LORD of hosts.
c48565	Moreover thou shalt say unto
c48566	them, Thus saith the LORD;
c48567	Shall they fall,
c48568	and not arise?
c48569	shall he turn away,
c48570	and not return?
c48571	Why <i>then</i> is this people of Jerusalem slidden back
c48572	by a perpetual backsliding?
c48573	they hold fast deceit,
c48574	they refuse
c48575	to return.
c48576	I hearkened
c48577	and heard,
c48578	<i>but</i> they spake not aright:
c48579	no man repented him of his wickedness,
c48580	saying,
c48581	What have I done?
c48582	every one turned to his course, as the horse
c48583	rusheth into the battle.
c48584	Yea, the stork in the heaven knoweth her appointed times;
c48585	and the turtle and the crane and the swallow observe the time
c48586	of their coming;
c48587	but my people know not the judgment of the LORD.
c48588	How do ye say,
c48589	We <i>are</i> wise,
c48590	and the law of the LORD <i>is</i> with
c48591	us? Lo, certainly in vain made he <i>it;</i> the pen of the scribes <i>is</i> in vain.
c48592	The wise <i>men</i> are ashamed,
c48593	they are dismayed
c48594	and taken:
c48595	lo, they have rejected the word of the LORD;
c48596	and what wisdom <i>is</i> in them?
c48597	Therefore will I give their wives unto others,
c48598	<i>and</i> their fields to them that shall inherit
c48599	<i>them:</i> for every one from the least even unto the greatest is given to covetousness,
c48600	from the prophet even unto the priest every one dealeth falsely.
c48601	For they have healed the hurt of the daughter of my people slightly,
c48602	saying,
c48603	Peace, peace;
c48604	when <i>there is</i> no peace.
c48607	Were they ashamed when they had committed abomination? nay, they were not at all ashamed,
c48609	they blush:
c48610	neither could
c48611	therefore shall they fall among them that fall:
c48612	in the time of their visitation they shall be cast down,
c48613	saith the LORD.
c48614	I will surely consume
c48615	them, saith the LORD:
c48616	<i>there shall be</i> no grapes on the vine,
c48617	nor figs on the fig tree,
c48618	and the leaf shall fade;
c48619	and <i>the things that</i> I have given
c48620	them shall pass away from them.
c48621	Why do we sit
c48622	still? assemble yourselves,
c48623	and let us enter into the defenced cities,
c48624	and let us be silent there:
c48625	for the LORD our God hath put us to silence,
c48626	and given us water of gall to drink,
c48627	because we have sinned against the LORD.
c48628	We looked for peace,
c48629	but no good
c48630	<i>came; and</i> for a time of health,
c48631	and behold trouble!
c48632	The snorting of his horses was heard from Dan:
c48633	the whole land trembled at the sound of the neighing of his strong ones;
c48634	for they are come,
c48635	and have devoured the land, and all that is in it; the city,
c48636	and those that dwell therein.
c48637	For, behold, I will send serpents, cockatrices,
c48638	among you, which <i>will</i> not <i>be</i> charmed,
c48639	and they shall bite
c48640	you, saith the LORD.
c48641	<i>When</i> I would comfort myself against sorrow,
c48642	my heart <i>is</i> faint in me.
c48643	Behold the voice of the cry of the daughter of my people because of them that dwell in a far country:
c48644	<i>Is</i> not the LORD in Zion?
c48645	<i>is</i> not her king
c48646	in her? Why have they provoked me to anger with their graven images, <i>and</i> with strange vanities?
c48647	The harvest is past,
c48648	the summer is ended,
c48649	and we are not saved.
c48650	For the hurt of the daughter of my people am I hurt;
c48651	I am black;
c48652	astonishment hath taken hold on me.
c48653	<i>Is there</i> no balm in Gilead;
c48654	<i>is there</i> no physician there?
c48655	why then is not the health of the daughter of my people recovered?
c48656	Oh that my head were waters,
c48657	and mine eyes a fountain of tears,
c48658	that I might weep day and night for the slain of the daughter of my people!
c48659	Oh that I had in the wilderness a lodging place of wayfaring men;
c48660	that I might leave my people,
c48661	and go from
c48662	them! for they <i>be</i> all adulterers,
c48663	an assembly of treacherous men.
c48664	And they bend their tongues
c48665	<i>like</i> their bow <i>for</i> lies:
c48666	but they are not valiant for the truth upon the earth;
c48667	for they proceed from evil to evil,
c48668	and they know not
c48669	me, saith the LORD.
c48670	every one of his neighbour,
c48671	Take ye heed
c48672	and trust ye not in any brother:
c48673	for every brother will utterly supplant,
c48674	and every neighbour will walk with slanders.
c48676	every one his neighbour,
c48677	And they will deceive
c48678	and will not speak the truth:
c48679	they have taught their tongue
c48680	to speak lies,
c48681	<i>and</i> weary themselves to commit iniquity.
c48682	Thine habitation <i>is</i> in the midst of deceit;
c48683	through deceit they refuse
c48684	to know
c48685	me, saith the LORD.
c48686	Therefore
c48687	thus saith the LORD of hosts,
c48688	Behold, I will melt
c48689	them, and try
c48690	them; for how shall I do for the daughter of my people?
c48691	Their tongue <i>is as</i> an arrow shot out;
c48692	it speaketh deceit:
c48693	<i>one</i> speaketh peaceably to his neighbour with his mouth,
c48694	but in heart he layeth his wait.
c48695	Shall I not visit them for these
c48696	<i>things?</i> saith the LORD:
c48698	on such a nation as this?
c48699	shall not my soul be avenged
c48700	For the mountains will I take up a weeping and wailing,
c48701	and for the habitations of the wilderness a lamentation,
c48702	because they are burned up,
c48703	so that none can pass through
c48704	<i>them;</i> neither can <i>men</i> hear the voice of the cattle;
c48705	both the fowl of the heavens and the beast are fled;
c48706	they are gone.
c48707	And I will make Jerusalem heaps, <i>and</i> a den of dragons;
c48708	and I will make the cities of Judah desolate, without an inhabitant.
c48709	Who <i>is</i> the wise man,
c48710	that may understand this?
c48711	and <i>who is he</i> to whom the mouth of the LORD hath spoken,
c48712	that he may declare
c48713	it, for what the land perisheth
c48714	<i>and</i> is burned up like a wilderness, that none passeth through?
c48715	And the LORD saith,
c48716	Because they have forsaken my law
c48717	which I set before
c48718	them, and have not obeyed my voice,
c48719	neither walked therein;
c48720	But have walked after the imagination of their own heart, and after Baalim,
c48721	which their fathers taught them:
c48722	Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel;
c48723	Behold, I will feed them, <i>even</i> this people, with wormwood,
c48724	and give them water of gall to drink.
c48725	I will scatter them also among the heathen,
c48726	whom neither they nor their fathers have known:
c48727	and I will send a sword after
c48728	them, till I have consumed them.
c48729	Thus saith the LORD of hosts,
c48730	Consider
c48731	ye, and call for the mourning women,
c48732	that they may come;
c48733	and send for cunning
c48734	<i>women,</i> that they may come:
c48735	And let them make haste,
c48736	and take up a wailing for
c48737	us, that our eyes may run down with tears,
c48738	and our eyelids gush out with waters.
c48739	For a voice of wailing is heard out of Zion,
c48740	How are we spoiled!
c48741	we are greatly confounded,
c48742	because we have forsaken the land,
c48743	because our dwellings have cast <i>us</i> out.
c48744	Yet hear
c48745	O ye women,
c48746	the word of the LORD,
c48747	and let your ear receive the word of his mouth,
c48748	and teach your daughters wailing,
c48749	and every one her neighbour lamentation.
c48750	For death is come up into our windows,
c48751	<i>and</i> is entered into our palaces,
c48752	to cut off the children from without,
c48753	<i>and</i> the young men from the streets.
c48754	Speak,
c48755	Thus saith the LORD,
c48756	Even the carcases of men shall fall as dung upon the open field,
c48757	and as the handful after the harvestman,
c48758	and none shall gather <i>them.</i>
c48759	Thus saith the LORD,
c48760	Let not the wise <i>man</i> glory in his wisdom,
c48761	neither let the mighty <i>man</i> glory in his might,
c48762	let not the rich <i>man</i> glory in his riches:
c48763	But let him that glorieth glory in this,
c48764	that he understandeth
c48765	and knoweth
c48766	me, that I <i>am</i> the LORD
c48767	which exercise lovingkindness, judgment, and righteousness, in the earth:
c48768	for in these <i>things</i> I delight,
c48769	saith the LORD.
c48770	Behold, the days come,
c48771	saith the LORD,
c48772	that I will punish all <i>them which are</i> circumcised with the uncircumcised;
c48773	Egypt, and Judah, and Edom, and the children of Ammon, and Moab, and all <i>that are</i> in the utmost corners,
c48774	that dwell in the wilderness:
c48775	for all <i>these</i> nations <i>are</i> uncircumcised,
c48776	and all the house of Israel <i>are</i> uncircumcised in the heart.
c48777	Hear ye the word
c48778	which the LORD speaketh unto
c48779	you, O house of Israel:
c48780	Thus saith the LORD,
c48781	Learn not the way of the heathen,
c48782	and be not dismayed at the signs of heaven;
c48783	for the heathen are dismayed at them.
c48784	For the customs of the people
c48785	<i>are</i> vain:
c48786	for <i>one</i> cutteth a tree out of the forest,
c48787	the work of the hands of the workman, with the axe.
c48788	They deck it with silver and with gold;
c48789	they fasten it with nails and with hammers,
c48790	that it move not.
c48791	They <i>are</i> upright as the palm tree,
c48792	but speak not:
c48793	they must needs be borne,
c48794	because they cannot go.
c48795	Be not afraid of
c48796	them; for they cannot do evil,
c48797	neither also <i>is it</i> in them to do good.
c48798	Forasmuch as <i>there is</i> none like unto thee,
c48799	O LORD;
c48800	thou <i>art</i> great,
c48801	and thy name <i>is</i> great in might.
c48802	Who would not fear
c48803	thee, O King of nations?
c48804	for to thee doth it appertain:
c48805	forasmuch as among all the wise <i>men</i> of the nations, and in all their kingdoms,
c48806	<i>there is</i> none like unto thee.
c48807	But they are altogether brutish
c48808	and foolish:
c48809	<i>is</i> a doctrine of vanities.
c48810	the stock
c48811	Silver spread into plates is brought from Tarshish,
c48812	and gold from Uphaz,
c48813	the work of the workman, and of the hands of the founder:
c48814	blue and purple <i>is</i> their clothing:
c48815	they <i>are</i> all the work of cunning <i>men.</i>
c48816	But the LORD <i>is</i> the true God,
c48817	he <i>is</i> the living God, and an everlasting king:
c48818	at his wrath the earth shall tremble,
c48819	and the nations shall not be able to abide his indignation.
c48820	Thus shall ye say
c48821	unto them, The gods
c48822	that have not made the heavens and the earth,
c48823	<i>even</i> they shall perish from the earth, and from under these heavens.
c48824	He hath made the earth by his power,
c48825	he hath established the world by his wisdom,
c48826	and hath stretched out the heavens by his discretion.
c48827	his voice,
c48828	When he uttereth
c48829	<i>there is</i> a multitude of waters in the heavens,
c48830	and he causeth the vapours to ascend from the ends of the earth;
c48831	he maketh lightnings with rain,
c48832	and bringeth forth the wind out of his treasures.
c48833	Every man is brutish in <i>his</i> knowledge:
c48834	every founder is confounded by the graven image:
c48835	for his molten image <i>is</i> falsehood,
c48836	and <i>there is</i> no breath in them.
c48837	They <i>are</i> vanity,
c48838	<i>and</i> the work of errors:
c48839	in the time of their visitation they shall perish.
c48840	The portion of Jacob <i>is</i> not like them:
c48841	for he <i>is</i> the former of all
c48842	<i>things;</i> and Israel <i>is</i> the rod of his inheritance:
c48843	The LORD of hosts <i>is</i> his name.
c48844	Gather up thy wares out of the land,
c48845	O inhabitant of the fortress.
c48846	For thus saith the LORD,
c48847	Behold, I will sling out the inhabitants of the land at this once,
c48848	and will distress
c48849	them, that they may find <i>it so.</i>
c48850	Woe is me for my hurt!
c48851	my wound is grievous:
c48852	but I said,
c48853	Truly this <i>is</i> a grief,
c48854	and I must bear it.
c48855	My tabernacle is spoiled,
c48856	and all my cords are broken:
c48857	my children are gone forth
c48858	of me, and they <i>are</i> not:
c48859	<i>there is</i> none to stretch forth my tent any more,
c48860	and to set up my curtains.
c48861	For the pastors are become brutish,
c48862	and have not sought the LORD:
c48863	therefore they shall not prosper,
c48864	and all their flocks shall be scattered.
c48866	Behold, the noise of the bruit is come,
c48867	and a great commotion out of the north country,
c48868	to make the cities of Judah desolate, <i>and</i> a den of dragons.
c48869	I know
c48870	O LORD,
c48871	that the way of man <i>is</i> not
c48872	in himself: <i>it is</i> not in man
c48873	that walketh
c48874	to direct his steps.
c48875	correct
c48876	O LORD,
c48877	me, but with judgment;
c48878	not in thine anger,
c48879	lest thou bring me to nothing.
c48880	Pour out thy fury upon the heathen
c48881	that know thee not,
c48882	and upon the families
c48883	that call not on thy name:
c48884	for they have eaten up Jacob,
c48885	and devoured
c48886	him, and consumed
c48887	him, and have made his habitation desolate.
c48888	The word
c48889	that came to Jeremiah from the LORD,
c48890	saying,
c48891	Hear ye the words of this covenant,
c48892	and speak unto the men of Judah, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem;
c48893	And say thou unto
c48894	them, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel;
c48895	Cursed <i>be</i> the man
c48896	that obeyeth not the words of this covenant,
c48897	Which I commanded your fathers in the day
c48898	<i>that</i> I brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, from the iron furnace,
c48899	saying,
c48900	Obey my voice,
c48901	and do them, according to all
c48902	which I command
c48903	you: so shall ye be my people,
c48904	and I will be your God:
c48905	That I may perform the oath
c48906	which I have sworn unto your fathers,
c48907	to give them a land flowing with milk and honey,
c48908	as <i>it is</i> this day.
c48909	Then answered
c48910	I, and said,
c48911	So be it,
c48912	O LORD.
c48913	Then the LORD said unto
c48914	me, Proclaim all these words in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem,
c48915	saying,
c48916	Hear ye the words of this covenant,
c48917	and do them.
c48918	For I earnestly protested unto your fathers in the day
c48919	<i>that</i> I brought them up out of the land of Egypt,
c48920	<i>even</i> unto this day,
c48921	rising early
c48922	and protesting,
c48923	saying,
c48924	Obey my voice.
c48925	Yet they obeyed not,
c48926	nor inclined their ear,
c48927	but walked every one in the imagination of their evil heart:
c48928	therefore I will bring upon them all the words of this covenant,
c48929	which I commanded
c48930	<i>them</i> to do;
c48931	but they did <i>them</i> not.
c48932	And the LORD said unto
c48933	me, A conspiracy is found among the men of Judah, and among the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
c48934	They are turned back to the iniquities of their forefathers,
c48935	which refused
c48936	to hear my words;
c48937	and they went after other gods
c48938	to serve
c48939	them: the house of Israel and the house of Judah have broken my covenant
c48940	which I made with their fathers.
c48941	Therefore thus saith the LORD,
c48942	Behold, I will bring evil upon
c48943	them, which they shall not be able
c48944	to escape;
c48945	and though they shall cry unto
c48946	me, I will not hearken unto them.
c48947	Then shall the cities of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem go,
c48948	and cry unto the gods
c48949	unto whom they offer incense:
c48950	but they shall not save them at all in the time of their trouble.
c48951	For <i>according to</i> the number of thy cities were thy gods,
c48952	O Judah;
c48953	and <i>according to</i> the number of the streets of Jerusalem have ye set up altars to <i>that</i> shameful thing,
c48954	<i>even</i> altars
c48955	to burn incense unto Baal.
c48956	Therefore pray not thou for this people,
c48957	neither lift up a cry or prayer for
c48958	them: for I will not hear <i>them</i> in the time
c48959	that they cry unto me for their trouble.
c48960	What hath my beloved to do in mine house,
c48961	<i>seeing</i> she hath wrought lewdness with many,
c48962	and the holy flesh is passed from
c48963	thee? when thou doest evil,
c48964	then thou rejoicest.
c48965	The LORD called thy name, A green olive tree, fair, <i>and</i> of goodly fruit:
c48966	with the noise of a great tumult he hath kindled fire upon
c48967	it, and the branches of it are broken.
c48968	For the LORD of hosts,
c48969	that planted
c48970	thee, hath pronounced evil against thee, for the evil of the house of Israel and of the house of Judah,
c48971	which they have done
c48972	against themselves to provoke me to anger
c48973	in offering incense unto Baal.
c48974	And the LORD hath given me knowledge
c48975	<i>of it,</i> and I know
c48976	<i>it:</i> then thou shewedst me their doings.
c48977	But I <i>was</i> like a lamb <i>or</i> an ox
c48978	<i>that</i> is brought
c48979	to the slaughter;
c48980	and I knew not
c48981	that they had devised devices against
c48982	me, <i>saying,</i> Let us destroy the tree with the fruit
c48983	thereof, and let us cut him off from the land of the living,
c48984	that his name may be no more remembered.
c48985	But, O LORD of hosts, that judgest righteously,
c48986	that triest the reins and the heart,
c48987	let me see thy vengeance on
c48988	them: for unto thee have I revealed my cause.
c48989	Therefore thus saith the LORD of the men of Anathoth,
c48990	that seek thy life,
c48991	saying,
c48992	Prophesy not in the name of the LORD,
c48993	that thou die not by our hand:
c48994	Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts,
c48995	Behold, I will punish
c48996	them: the young men shall die by the sword;
c48997	their sons and their daughters shall die by famine:
c48998	And there shall be no remnant
c48999	of them: for I will bring evil upon the men of Anathoth, <i>even</i> the year of their visitation.
c49000	Righteous <i>art</i> thou,
c49001	O LORD,
c49002	when I plead with
c49003	thee: yet let me talk with thee of <i>thy</i> judgments:
c49004	Wherefore doth the way of the wicked prosper?
c49005	<i>wherefore</i> are all they happy that deal very treacherously?
c49006	Thou hast planted
c49007	them, yea, they have taken root:
c49008	they grow,
c49009	yea, they bring forth fruit:
c49010	thou <i>art</i> near in their mouth,
c49011	and far from their reins.
c49012	But thou,
c49013	O LORD,
c49014	knowest
c49015	me: thou hast seen
c49016	me, and tried mine heart toward
c49017	thee: pull them out like sheep for the slaughter,
c49018	and prepare them for the day of slaughter.
c49019	How long shall the land mourn,
c49020	and the herbs of every field wither,
c49021	for the wickedness of them that dwell therein? the beasts are consumed, and the birds;
c49022	because they said,
c49023	He shall not see our last end.
c49024	If thou hast run with the footmen,
c49025	and they have wearied
c49026	thee, then how canst thou contend with horses?
c49027	and <i>if</i> in the land of peace, <i>wherein</i> thou trustedst,
c49028	<i>they wearied thee,</i> then how wilt thou do in the swelling of Jordan?
c49029	For even thy brethren, and the house of thy father,
c49030	even they have dealt treacherously
c49031	with thee; yea, they have called a multitude after
c49032	thee: believe them not,
c49033	though they speak fair words unto thee.
c49034	I have forsaken mine house,
c49035	I have left mine heritage;
c49036	I have given the dearly beloved of my soul into the hand of her enemies.
c49037	Mine heritage is unto me as a lion in the forest;
c49038	it crieth out against
c49039	me: therefore have I hated it.
c49040	Mine heritage <i>is</i> unto me <i>as</i> a speckled bird,
c49041	the birds round about <i>are</i> against
c49042	her; come
c49043	ye, assemble all the beasts of the field,
c49044	come to devour.
c49045	Many pastors have destroyed my vineyard,
c49046	they have trodden my portion under foot,
c49047	they have made my pleasant portion a desolate wilderness.
c49048	They have made it desolate, <i>and being</i> desolate
c49049	it mourneth unto
c49050	me; the whole land is made desolate,
c49051	because no man layeth <i>it</i> to heart.
c49052	The spoilers are come upon all high places through the wilderness:
c49053	for the sword of the LORD shall devour from the <i>one</i> end of the land even to the <i>other</i> end of the land:
c49054	no flesh shall have peace.
c49055	They have sown wheat,
c49056	but shall reap thorns:
c49057	they have put themselves to pain,
c49058	<i>but</i> shall not profit:
c49059	and they shall be ashamed of your revenues because of the fierce anger of the LORD.
c49060	Thus saith the LORD against all mine evil neighbours,
c49061	that touch the inheritance
c49062	which I have caused my people Israel to inherit;
c49063	Behold, I will pluck them out of their land,
c49064	and pluck out the house of Judah from among them.
c49065	And it shall come to pass,
c49066	after that I have plucked them out
c49067	I will return,
c49068	and have compassion
c49069	on them, and will bring them again,
c49070	every man to his heritage,
c49071	and every man to his land.
c49072	And it shall come to pass,
c49073	if they will diligently learn the ways of my people,
c49074	to swear by my name,
c49075	The LORD liveth;
c49076	as they taught my people
c49077	to swear by Baal;
c49078	then shall they be built in the midst of my people.
c49079	But if they will not obey,
c49080	I will utterly pluck up and destroy that nation,
c49083	saith the LORD.
c49084	Thus saith the LORD unto
c49085	me, Go
c49086	and get thee a linen girdle,
c49087	and put it upon thy loins,
c49088	and put it not in water.
c49089	So I got a girdle according to the word of the LORD,
c49090	and put <i>it</i> on my loins.
c49091	And the word of the LORD came unto me the second time,
c49092	saying,
c49093	Take the girdle
c49094	that thou hast got,
c49095	which <i>is</i> upon thy loins,
c49096	and arise,
c49097	go to Euphrates,
c49098	and hide it there in a hole of the rock.
c49099	So I went,
c49100	and hid it by Euphrates,
c49101	as the LORD commanded me.
c49102	And it came to pass after many days,
c49103	that the LORD said unto
c49104	me, Arise,
c49105	go to Euphrates,
c49106	and take the girdle from thence,
c49107	which I commanded
c49108	thee to hide there.
c49109	Then I went to Euphrates,
c49110	and digged,
c49111	and took the girdle from the place
c49112	where I had hid
c49113	it: and, behold,
c49114	the girdle was marred,
c49115	it was profitable for nothing.
c49116	Then the word of the LORD came unto
c49117	me, saying,
c49118	Thus saith the LORD,
c49119	After this manner will I mar the pride of Judah, and the great pride of Jerusalem.
c49120	This evil people,
c49121	which refuse
c49122	to hear my words,
c49123	which walk in the imagination of their heart,
c49124	and walk after other gods,
c49125	to serve
c49126	them, and to worship
c49127	them, shall even be as this girdle,
c49128	which is good for nothing.
c49129	For
c49130	as the girdle cleaveth to the loins of a man,
c49131	so have I caused to cleave unto me the whole house of Israel and the whole house of Judah,
c49132	saith the LORD;
c49133	that they might be unto me for a people, and for a name, and for a praise, and for a glory:
c49134	but they would not hear.
c49135	Therefore thou shalt speak unto them this word;
c49136	Thus saith the LORD God of Israel,
c49137	Every bottle shall be filled with wine:
c49138	and they shall say unto
c49139	thee, Do we not certainly know
c49140	that every bottle shall be filled with wine?
c49141	Then shalt thou say unto
c49142	them, Thus saith the LORD,
c49143	Behold, I will fill all the inhabitants of this land,
c49144	even the kings
c49145	that sit upon David's throne,
c49146	and the priests, and the prophets, and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, with drunkenness.
c49147	And I will dash
c49148	them one against another,
c49149	even the fathers and the sons together,
c49150	saith the LORD:
c49151	I will not pity,
c49152	nor spare,
c49153	nor have mercy,
c49154	but destroy them.
c49155	Hear
c49156	ye, and give ear;
c49157	be not proud:
c49158	for the LORD hath spoken.
c49159	Give glory to the LORD your God,
c49160	before he cause darkness,
c49161	and before your feet stumble upon the dark mountains,
c49162	and, while ye look for light,
c49163	he turn it into the shadow of death,
c49164	<i>and</i> make <i>it</i> gross darkness.
c49165	But if ye will not hear
c49166	it, my soul shall weep in secret places for <i>your</i> pride;
c49168	and mine eye shall weep sore, and run down with tears,
c49169	because the LORD'S flock is carried away captive.
c49170	Say unto the king and to the queen,
c49171	Humble yourselves,
c49172	sit down:
c49173	for your principalities shall come down, <i>even</i> the crown of your glory.
c49174	The cities of the south shall be shut up,
c49175	and none shall open
c49176	<i>them:</i> Judah shall be carried away captive all
c49177	of it, it shall be wholly carried away captive.
c49178	Lift up your eyes,
c49179	and behold
c49180	them that come from the north:
c49181	where <i>is</i> the flock
c49182	<i>that</i> was given
c49183	thee, thy beautiful flock?
c49184	What wilt thou say
c49185	when he shall punish
c49186	thee? for thou hast taught them <i>to be</i> captains, <i>and</i> as chief over
c49187	thee: shall not sorrows take thee, as a woman in travail?
c49188	And if thou say in thine heart,
c49189	Wherefore come these things
c49190	upon me? For the greatness of thine iniquity are thy skirts discovered,
c49191	<i>and</i> thy heels made bare.
c49192	Can the Ethiopian change his skin,
c49193	or the leopard his spots?
c49194	<i>then</i> may ye also
c49195	do good,
c49196	that are accustomed to do evil.
c49197	Therefore will I scatter them as the stubble
c49198	that passeth away by the wind of the wilderness.
c49199	This <i>is</i> thy lot,
c49200	the portion of thy measures from
c49201	me, saith the LORD;
c49202	because thou hast forgotten
c49203	me, and trusted in falsehood.
c49204	Therefore will I discover thy skirts upon thy face,
c49205	that thy shame may appear.
c49206	on the hills in the fields.
c49207	I have seen thine adulteries, and thy neighings, the lewdness of thy whoredom, <i>and</i> thine abominations
c49208	Woe
c49209	unto thee, O Jerusalem!
c49210	wilt thou not be made clean? when <i>shall it</i> once <i>be?</i>
c49211	The word of the LORD that came to Jeremiah concerning the dearth.
c49212	Judah mourneth,
c49213	and the gates thereof languish;
c49214	they are black unto the ground;
c49215	and the cry of Jerusalem is gone up.
c49216	And their nobles have sent their little ones to the waters:
c49217	they came to the pits,
c49218	<i>and</i> found no water;
c49219	they returned
c49220	with their vessels empty;
c49221	they were ashamed
c49222	and confounded,
c49223	and covered their heads.
c49224	Because the ground is chapt,
c49225	for there was no rain in the earth,
c49226	the plowmen were ashamed,
c49227	they covered their heads.
c49228	Yea, the hind also calved in the field, and forsook <i>it,</i> because
c49230	there was no grass.
c49231	And the wild asses did stand in the high places,
c49232	they snuffed up the wind like dragons;
c49233	their eyes did fail,
c49234	because <i>there was</i> no grass.
c49235	though our iniquities testify
c49236	O LORD,
c49237	against us, do thou <i>it</i> for thy name's sake:
c49238	for our backslidings are many;
c49239	we have sinned against thee.
c49240	O the hope of Israel,
c49241	the saviour thereof in time of trouble,
c49242	why shouldest thou be as a stranger in the land,
c49243	and as a wayfaring man
c49244	<i>that</i> turneth aside
c49245	to tarry for a night?
c49246	Why shouldest thou be as a man astonied,
c49247	as a mighty man
c49248	<i>that</i> cannot
c49249	save?
c49250	yet thou, O LORD, <i>art</i> in the midst
c49252	of us, and we are called by thy name;
c49253	leave us not.
c49254	Thus saith the LORD unto this people,
c49255	Thus have they loved
c49256	to wander,
c49257	they have not refrained their feet,
c49258	therefore the LORD doth not accept
c49259	them; he will now remember their iniquity,
c49260	and visit their sins.
c49261	Then said the LORD unto
c49262	me, Pray not for this people for <i>their</i> good.
c49263	When they fast,
c49264	I will not hear their cry;
c49265	and when they offer burnt offering and an oblation,
c49266	I will not accept
c49267	them: but I will consume them by the sword, and by the famine, and by the pestilence.
c49268	Then said
c49269	I, Ah, Lord GOD!
c49270	behold, the prophets say
c49271	unto them, Ye shall not see the sword,
c49272	neither shall ye have famine;
c49273	but I will give you assured peace in this place.
c49274	Then the LORD said unto
c49275	me, The prophets prophesy lies in my name:
c49276	I sent them not,
c49277	neither have I commanded
c49278	them, neither spake unto
c49279	them: they prophesy unto you a false vision and divination, and a thing of nought, and the deceit of their heart.
c49280	Therefore thus saith the LORD concerning the prophets
c49281	that prophesy in my name,
c49282	and I sent them not,
c49283	yet they say,
c49284	Sword and famine shall not be in this land;
c49285	By sword and famine shall those prophets be consumed.
c49286	And the people
c49287	to whom they prophesy shall be cast out in the streets of Jerusalem because of the famine and the sword;
c49289	and they shall have none to bury them, them, their wives, nor their sons, nor their daughters:
c49290	for I will pour their wickedness upon them.
c49291	Therefore thou shalt say this word unto
c49292	them; Let mine eyes run down with tears night and day,
c49293	and let them not cease:
c49294	for the virgin daughter of my people is broken with a great breach,
c49295	with a very grievous blow.
c49296	If I go forth into the field,
c49297	then behold the slain with the sword!
c49298	and if I enter into the city,
c49299	then behold them that are sick with famine!
c49300	yea, both the prophet and the priest go about into a land
c49301	that they know not.
c49302	Hast thou utterly rejected Judah?
c49303	hath thy soul lothed Zion?
c49304	why hast thou smitten
c49305	us, and <i>there is</i> no healing
c49306	for us? we looked for peace,
c49307	and <i>there is</i> no good;
c49308	and for the time of healing,
c49309	and behold trouble!
c49310	We acknowledge,
c49311	O LORD,
c49312	our wickedness, <i>and</i> the iniquity of our fathers:
c49313	for we have sinned against thee.
c49314	Do not abhor <i>us,</i> for thy name's sake,
c49315	do not disgrace the throne of thy glory:
c49316	remember,
c49317	break not thy covenant with us.
c49318	Are there <i>any</i> among the vanities of the Gentiles that can cause rain?
c49319	or can the heavens give showers?
c49320	<i>art</i> not thou he,
c49321	O LORD our God?
c49322	therefore we will wait
c49323	upon thee: for thou hast made all these <i>things.</i>
c49324	Then said the LORD unto
c49325	me, Though Moses and Samuel stood before
c49326	me, <i>yet</i> my mind <i>could</i> not <i>be</i> toward this people:
c49327	cast <i>them</i> out of my sight,
c49328	and let them go forth.
c49329	And it shall come to pass,
c49330	if they say unto
c49331	thee, Whither shall we go forth?
c49332	then thou shalt tell
c49333	them, Thus saith the LORD;
c49334	Such as <i>are</i> for death,
c49335	to death;
c49337	and such as <i>are</i> for the sword,
c49338	to the sword;
c49340	and such as <i>are</i> for the famine,
c49341	to the famine;
c49343	and such as <i>are</i> for the captivity,
c49344	to the captivity.
c49345	And I will appoint over them four kinds,
c49346	saith the LORD:
c49347	the sword
c49348	to slay,
c49349	and the dogs
c49350	to tear,
c49351	and the fowls of the heaven, and the beasts of the earth,
c49352	to devour
c49353	and destroy.
c49354	And I will cause them to be removed into all kingdoms of the earth, because of Manasseh the son of Hezekiah king of Judah,
c49355	for <i>that</i> which he did in Jerusalem.
c49356	For who shall have pity upon
c49357	thee, O Jerusalem?
c49358	or who shall bemoan
c49359	thee? or who shall go aside
c49360	to ask how thou doest?
c49361	Thou hast forsaken
c49362	me, saith the LORD,
c49363	thou art gone backward:
c49364	therefore will I stretch out my hand against
c49365	thee, and destroy
c49366	thee; I am weary
c49367	with repenting.
c49368	And I will fan them with a fan in the gates of the land;
c49369	I will bereave
c49370	<i>them</i> of children, I will destroy my people,
c49371	<i>since</i> they return not from their ways.
c49372	Their widows are increased to me above the sand of the seas:
c49373	I have brought upon them against the mother of the young men a spoiler at noonday:
c49374	I have caused <i>him</i> to fall upon it suddenly, and terrors upon the city.
c49375	She that hath borne seven languisheth:
c49376	she hath given up the ghost;
c49377	her sun is gone down while <i>it was</i> yet day:
c49378	she hath been ashamed
c49379	and confounded:
c49380	and the residue of them will I deliver to the sword before their enemies,
c49381	saith the LORD.
c49382	Woe
c49383	is me, my mother,
c49384	that thou hast borne me a man of strife and a man of contention to the whole earth!
c49385	I have neither lent on usury,
c49386	nor men have lent to me on usury;
c49387	<i>yet</i> every one of them doth curse me.
c49388	The LORD said,
c49389	Verily it shall be well with thy remnant;
c49390	verily I will cause the enemy to entreat thee <i>well</i> in the time of evil and in the time of affliction.
c49391	Shall iron break the northern iron
c49392	and the steel?
c49393	Thy substance and thy treasures will I give to the spoil
c49394	without price,
c49395	and <i>that</i> for all thy sins, even in all thy borders.
c49396	And I will make <i>thee</i> to pass with thine enemies into a land
c49397	<i>which</i> thou knowest not:
c49398	for a fire is kindled in mine anger,
c49399	<i>which</i> shall burn upon you.
c49400	thou knowest:
c49401	O LORD,
c49402	remember
c49403	me, and visit
c49404	me, and revenge me of my persecutors;
c49405	take me not away in thy longsuffering:
c49406	know
c49407	that for thy sake I have suffered rebuke.
c49408	Thy words were found,
c49409	and I did eat
c49410	them; and thy word was unto me the joy and rejoicing of mine heart:
c49411	for I am called by thy name,
c49412	O LORD God of hosts.
c49413	I sat not in the assembly of the mockers,
c49414	nor rejoiced;
c49415	I sat alone because of thy hand:
c49416	for thou hast filled me with indignation.
c49417	Why is my pain perpetual,
c49418	and my wound incurable,
c49419	<i>which</i> refuseth
c49420	to be healed?
c49421	wilt thou be altogether unto me as a liar,
c49422	<i>and as</i> waters
c49423	<i>that</i> fail?
c49424	Therefore thus saith the LORD,
c49425	If thou return,
c49426	then will I bring thee again,
c49427	<i>and</i> thou shalt stand before
c49428	me: and if thou take forth the precious from the vile,
c49429	thou shalt be as my mouth:
c49430	let them return unto
c49431	thee; but return not thou unto them.
c49432	And I will make thee unto this people a fenced brasen wall:
c49433	and they shall fight against
c49434	thee, but they shall not prevail
c49435	against thee: for I <i>am</i> with
c49436	thee to save
c49437	thee and to deliver
c49438	thee, saith the LORD.
c49439	And I will deliver thee out of the hand of the wicked,
c49440	and I will redeem thee out of the hand of the terrible.
c49441	The word of the LORD came also unto
c49442	me, saying,
c49443	Thou shalt not take thee a wife,
c49444	neither shalt thou have sons or daughters in this place.
c49445	For thus saith the LORD concerning the sons and concerning the daughters
c49446	that bare
c49447	and concerning their mothers
c49448	that begat them in this land;
c49449	them, and concerning their fathers
c49450	that are born in this place,
c49451	They shall die of grievous deaths;
c49452	they shall not be lamented;
c49453	neither shall they be buried;
c49454	<i>but</i> they shall be as dung upon the face of the earth: and they shall be
c49455	consumed by the sword, and by famine;
c49456	and their carcases shall be meat for the fowls of heaven, and for the beasts of the earth.
c49457	For thus saith the LORD,
c49458	Enter not into the house of mourning,
c49459	neither go
c49460	to lament
c49461	nor bemoan
c49462	them: for I have taken away my peace from this people, saith the LORD, <i>even</i>
c49464	lovingkindness and mercies.
c49465	Both the great and the small shall die in this land:
c49466	they shall not be buried,
c49467	neither shall <i>men</i> lament
c49468	for them, nor cut themselves,
c49469	nor make themselves bald for them:
c49470	Neither shall <i>men</i> tear <i>themselves</i> for them in mourning,
c49471	to comfort them for the dead;
c49472	neither shall <i>men</i> give them the cup of consolation to drink for their father or for their mother.
c49473	Thou shalt not also go into the house of feasting,
c49474	to sit with
c49475	them to eat
c49476	and to drink.
c49477	For thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel;
c49478	Behold, I will cause to cease out of this place in your eyes, and in your days, the voice of mirth, and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the bride.
c49479	And it shall come to pass,
c49480	when thou shalt shew this people all these words,
c49481	and they shall say unto
c49482	thee, Wherefore hath the LORD pronounced all this great evil against
c49483	us? or what <i>is</i> our iniquity?
c49484	or what <i>is</i> our sin
c49485	that we have committed against the LORD our God?
c49486	Then shalt thou say unto
c49487	them, Because your fathers have forsaken
c49488	me, saith the LORD,
c49489	and have walked after other gods,
c49490	and have served
c49491	them, and have worshipped
c49492	them, and have forsaken
c49493	me, and have not kept my law;
c49494	And ye have done worse
c49495	than your fathers;
c49496	for, behold, ye walk every one after the imagination of his evil heart,
c49497	that they may not hearken unto me:
c49498	Therefore will I cast you out of this land into a land
c49499	that ye know not, <i>neither</i> ye nor your fathers;
c49500	and there shall ye serve other gods day and night;
c49501	where I will not shew you favour.
c49502	Therefore, behold, the days come,
c49503	saith the LORD,
c49504	that it shall no more be said,
c49505	The LORD liveth,
c49506	that brought up the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt;
c49507	But,
c49508	The LORD liveth,
c49509	that brought up the children of Israel from the land of the north, and from all the lands
c49510	whither he had driven
c49511	them: and I will bring them again into their land
c49512	that I gave unto their fathers.
c49513	Behold, I will send for many fishers,
c49514	saith the LORD,
c49515	and they shall fish
c49516	them; and after will I send for many hunters,
c49517	and they shall hunt them from every mountain, and from every hill, and out of the holes of the rocks.
c49518	For mine eyes <i>are</i> upon all their ways:
c49519	they are not hid from my face,
c49520	neither is their iniquity hid from mine eyes.
c49521	And first I will recompense their iniquity and their sin double;
c49522	because they have defiled my land,
c49523	they have filled mine inheritance with the carcases of their detestable and abominable things.
c49524	O LORD, my strength, and my fortress, and my refuge in the day of affliction,
c49525	the Gentiles shall come unto thee from the ends of the earth,
c49526	and shall say,
c49527	Surely our fathers have inherited lies,
c49528	vanity,
c49529	and <i>things</i> wherein <i>there is</i> no profit.
c49530	Shall a man make gods
c49531	unto himself, and they <i>are</i> no gods?
c49532	Therefore, behold, I will this once cause them to know,
c49533	I will cause them to know mine hand and my might;
c49534	and they shall know
c49535	that my name <i>is</i> The LORD.
c49536	The sin of Judah <i>is</i> written with a pen of iron,
c49537	<i>and</i> with the point of a diamond: <i>it is</i> graven upon the table of their heart, and upon the horns of your altars;
c49538	Whilst their children remember their altars and their groves by the green trees upon the high hills.
c49539	O my mountain in the field,
c49540	I will give thy substance <i>and</i> all thy treasures to the spoil,
c49541	<i>and</i> thy high places for sin, throughout all thy borders.
c49542	And thou, even thyself, shalt discontinue
c49543	from thine heritage
c49544	that I gave
c49545	thee; and I will cause thee to serve thine enemies in the land
c49546	which thou knowest not:
c49547	for ye have kindled a fire in mine anger,
c49548	<i>which</i> shall burn for ever.
c49549	Thus saith the LORD;
c49550	Cursed <i>be</i> the man
c49551	that trusteth in man,
c49552	and maketh flesh his arm,
c49553	and whose heart departeth from the LORD.
c49554	For he shall be like the heath in the desert,
c49555	and shall not see
c49556	when good cometh;
c49557	but shall inhabit the parched places in the wilderness, <i>in</i> a salt land
c49558	and not inhabited.
c49559	Blessed <i>is</i> the man
c49560	that trusteth in the LORD,
c49561	and whose hope the LORD is.
c49562	For he shall be as a tree
c49563	planted by the waters,
c49564	and <i>that</i> spreadeth out her roots by the river,
c49565	and shall not see
c49566	when heat cometh,
c49567	but her leaf shall be green;
c49568	and shall not be careful in the year of drought,
c49569	neither shall cease
c49570	from yielding fruit.
c49571	The heart <i>is</i> deceitful above all
c49572	<i>things,</i> and desperately wicked:
c49573	who can know it?
c49574	I the LORD search the heart,
c49575	<i>I</i> try the reins,
c49576	even to give every man according to his ways, <i>and</i> according to the fruit of his doings.
c49577	<i>As</i> the partridge sitteth
c49578	<i>on eggs,</i> and hatcheth <i>them</i> not;
c49579	<i>so</i> he that getteth riches,
c49580	and not by right,
c49581	shall leave them in the midst of his days,
c49582	and at his end shall be a fool.
c49583	A glorious high throne
c49584	from the beginning
c49585	<i>is</i> the place of our sanctuary.
c49586	O LORD, the hope of Israel,
c49587	all that forsake thee shall be ashamed,
c49588	<i>and</i> they that depart from me shall be written in the earth,
c49589	because they have forsaken the LORD, the fountain of living waters.
c49590	Heal
c49591	me, O LORD,
c49592	and I shall be healed;
c49593	save
c49594	me, and I shall be saved:
c49595	for thou <i>art</i> my praise.
c49596	Behold, they say unto
c49597	me, Where <i>is</i> the word of the LORD?
c49598	let it come now.
c49599	As for me, I have not hastened from <i>being</i> a pastor to follow
c49600	thee: neither have I desired the woeful day;
c49601	thou knowest:
c49602	that which came out of my lips was <i>right</i> before thee.
c49603	Be not a terror
c49604	unto me: thou <i>art</i> my hope in the day of evil.
c49605	Let them be confounded that persecute
c49606	me, but let not me be confounded:
c49607	let them be dismayed,
c49608	but let not me be dismayed:
c49609	bring upon them the day of evil,
c49610	and destroy them with double destruction.
c49611	Thus said the LORD unto
c49612	me; Go
c49613	and stand in the gate of the children of the people,
c49614	whereby the kings of Judah come in,
c49615	and by the which they go out,
c49616	and in all the gates of Jerusalem;
c49617	And say unto
c49618	them, Hear ye the word of the LORD,
c49619	ye kings of Judah, and all Judah, and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem,
c49620	that enter in by these gates:
c49621	Thus saith the LORD;
c49622	Take heed to yourselves,
c49623	and bear no burden on the sabbath day,
c49624	nor bring <i>it</i> in by the gates of Jerusalem;
c49625	Neither carry forth a burden out of your houses on the sabbath day,
c49626	neither do ye any work,
c49627	but hallow ye the sabbath day,
c49628	as I commanded your fathers.
c49629	But they obeyed not,
c49630	neither inclined their ear,
c49631	but made their neck stiff,
c49632	that they might not hear,
c49633	nor receive instruction.
c49634	And it shall come to pass,
c49635	if ye diligently hearken unto
c49636	me, saith the LORD,
c49637	to bring in no burden through the gates of this city on the sabbath day,
c49638	but hallow the sabbath day,
c49639	to do no work therein;
c49640	Then shall there enter into the gates of this city kings and princes
c49641	sitting upon the throne of David,
c49642	riding in chariots and on horses,
c49643	they, and their princes, the men of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem:
c49644	and this city shall remain for ever.
c49645	And they shall come from the cities of Judah, and from the places about Jerusalem, and from the land of Benjamin, and from the plain, and from the mountains, and from the south,
c49646	bringing burnt offerings, and sacrifices, and meat offerings, and incense,
c49647	and bringing sacrifices of praise, unto the house of the LORD.
c49648	But if ye will not hearken unto
c49649	me to hallow the sabbath day,
c49650	and not to bear a burden,
c49651	even entering in at the gates of Jerusalem on the sabbath day;
c49652	then will I kindle a fire in the gates
c49653	thereof, and it shall devour the palaces of Jerusalem,
c49654	and it shall not be quenched.
c49655	The word
c49656	which came to Jeremiah from the LORD,
c49657	saying,
c49658	Arise,
c49659	and go down to the potter's house,
c49660	and there I will cause thee to hear my words.
c49661	Then I went down to the potter's house,
c49662	and, behold, he wrought a work on the wheels.
c49663	And the vessel that he made of clay was marred
c49665	in the hand of the potter:
c49667	so he made it again another vessel,
c49668	as seemed good to the potter
c49669	to make <i>it.</i>
c49670	Then the word of the LORD came to
c49671	me, saying,
c49672	cannot I do with you as this potter?
c49674	O house of Israel,
c49675	saith the LORD.
c49676	Behold, as the clay <i>is</i> in the potter's hand,
c49677	so <i>are</i> ye in mine hand,
c49678	O house of Israel.
c49679	<i>At what</i> instant I shall speak concerning a nation, and concerning a kingdom,
c49680	to pluck up,
c49681	and to pull down,
c49682	and to destroy <i>it;</i>
c49683	If that nation, against whom I have pronounced, turn from their evil,
c49685	I will repent of the evil
c49686	that I thought
c49687	to do unto them.
c49688	And <i>at what</i> instant I shall speak concerning a nation, and concerning a kingdom,
c49689	to build
c49690	and to plant <i>it;</i>
c49691	If it do
c49692	evil in my sight,
c49693	that it obey not my voice,
c49694	then I will repent of the good,
c49695	wherewith I said
c49696	I would benefit them.
c49697	Now
c49698	therefore go to, speak to the men of Judah, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem,
c49699	saying,
c49700	Thus saith the LORD;
c49701	Behold, I frame evil against
c49702	you, and devise a device against
c49703	you: return ye now every one from his evil way,
c49704	and make your ways and your doings good.
c49705	And they said,
c49706	There is no hope:
c49707	but we will walk after our own devices,
c49709	and we will every one do the imagination of his evil heart.
c49711	Therefore thus saith the LORD;
c49712	Ask ye now among the heathen,
c49713	who hath heard such
c49714	things: the virgin of Israel hath done a very horrible thing.
c49715	Will <i>a man</i> leave the snow of Lebanon <i>which cometh</i> from the rock of the field?
c49716	<i>or</i> shall the cold flowing waters that come from another place be forsaken?
c49717	Because my people hath forgotten
c49718	me, they have burned incense to vanity,
c49719	and they have caused them to stumble in their ways <i>from</i> the ancient paths,
c49720	to walk in paths,
c49721	<i>in</i> a way
c49722	not cast up;
c49723	To make their land desolate, <i>and</i> a perpetual hissing;
c49724	every one
c49725	that passeth thereby
c49726	shall be astonished,
c49727	and wag his head.
c49728	I will scatter them as with an east wind before the enemy;
c49730	and not the face, in the day of their calamity.
c49731	I will shew them the back,
c49732	Then said
c49733	they, Come,
c49734	and let us devise devices against Jeremiah;
c49735	for the law shall not perish from the priest,
c49736	nor counsel from the wise,
c49737	nor the word from the prophet.
c49738	Come,
c49739	and let us smite him with the tongue,
c49740	and let us not give heed to any of his words.
c49741	Give heed
c49742	me, O LORD,
c49743	to
c49744	and hearken to the voice of them that contend with me.
c49745	Shall evil be recompensed for good?
c49746	for they have digged a pit for my soul.
c49747	Remember
c49748	that I stood before
c49749	thee to speak good for
c49750	them, <i>and</i> to turn away thy wrath from them.
c49751	Therefore deliver up their children to the famine,
c49752	and pour out their <i>blood</i> by the force of the sword;
c49753	and let their wives be bereaved of their children, and <i>be</i> widows;
c49754	and let their men be put to death;
c49755	<i>let</i> their young men <i>be</i> slain by the sword in battle.
c49756	Let a cry be heard from their houses,
c49757	when thou shalt bring a troop suddenly upon
c49758	them: for they have digged a pit
c49759	to take
c49760	me, and hid snares for my feet.
c49761	thou
c49762	Yet, LORD,
c49763	knowest all their counsel against me to slay
c49764	<i>me:</i> forgive not their iniquity,
c49765	neither blot out their sin from thy sight,
c49766	but let them be overthrown before
c49767	thee; deal <i>thus</i> with them in the time of thine anger.
c49768	Thus saith the LORD,
c49769	Go
c49770	and get a potter's earthen bottle,
c49771	and <i>take</i> of the ancients of the people, and of the ancients of the priests;
c49772	And go forth unto the valley of the son of Hinnom,
c49773	which <i>is</i> by the entry of the east gate,
c49774	and proclaim there the words
c49775	that I shall tell thee,
c49776	And say,
c49777	Hear ye the word of the LORD,
c49778	O kings of Judah, and inhabitants of Jerusalem;
c49779	Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel;
c49780	Behold, I will bring evil upon this place,
c49781	the which whosoever
c49782	heareth,
c49783	his ears shall tingle.
c49784	Because they have forsaken
c49785	me, and have estranged this place,
c49786	and have burned incense in it unto other gods,
c49787	whom neither they nor their fathers have known, nor the kings of Judah,
c49788	and have filled this place with the blood of innocents;
c49789	They have built also the high places of Baal,
c49790	to burn their sons with fire <i>for</i> burnt offerings unto Baal,
c49791	which I commanded not,
c49792	nor spake
c49793	<i>it,</i> neither came <i>it</i> into my mind:
c49794	Therefore, behold, the days come,
c49795	saith the LORD,
c49796	that this place shall no more be called Tophet, nor The valley of the son of Hinnom,
c49797	but The valley of slaughter.
c49798	And I will make void the counsel of Judah and Jerusalem in this place;
c49799	and I will cause them to fall by the sword before their enemies, and by the hands of them that seek their lives:
c49800	and their carcases will I give to be meat for the fowls of the heaven, and for the beasts of the earth.
c49801	And I will make this city desolate, and an hissing;
c49802	every one
c49803	that passeth thereby
c49804	shall be astonished
c49805	and hiss because of all the plagues thereof.
c49806	And I will cause them to eat the flesh of their sons and the flesh of their daughters,
c49809	and they shall eat every one the flesh of his friend in the siege and straitness,
c49810	wherewith their enemies, and they that seek their lives, shall straiten them.
c49811	Then shalt thou break the bottle in the sight of the men
c49812	that go with thee,
c49813	And shalt say unto
c49814	them, Thus saith the LORD of hosts;
c49815	Even so will I break this people and this city,
c49816	as <i>one</i> breaketh a potter's vessel,
c49817	that cannot
c49818	be made whole again:
c49819	and they shall bury <i>them</i> in Tophet, till <i>there be</i> no place
c49820	to bury.
c49821	Thus will I do unto this place,
c49822	saith the LORD,
c49823	and to the inhabitants
c49824	thereof, and <i>even</i> make this city as Tophet:
c49825	And the houses of Jerusalem, and the houses of the kings of Judah, shall be defiled as the place of Tophet,
c49826	because of all the houses
c49827	upon whose roofs they have burned incense unto all the host of heaven,
c49828	and have poured out drink offerings unto other gods.
c49829	Then came Jeremiah from Tophet,
c49830	whither the LORD had sent
c49831	him to prophesy;
c49832	and he stood in the court of the LORD'S house;
c49833	and said to all the people,
c49834	Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel;
c49835	Behold, I will bring upon this city and upon all her towns all the evil
c49836	that I have pronounced against
c49837	it, because they have hardened their necks,
c49838	that they might not hear my words.
c49839	Now Pashur the son of Immer the priest, who <i>was</i> also chief governor in the house of the LORD, heard
c49841	that Jeremiah
c49842	prophesied these things.
c49843	Then Pashur smote Jeremiah the prophet,
c49844	and put him in the stocks
c49845	that <i>were</i> in the high gate of Benjamin,
c49846	which <i>was</i> by the house of the LORD.
c49847	And it came to pass on the morrow,
c49848	that Pashur brought forth Jeremiah out of the stocks.
c49849	Then said Jeremiah unto
c49850	him, The LORD hath not called thy name Pashur,
c49851	but Magormissabib.
c49852	For thus saith the LORD,
c49853	Behold, I will make thee a terror to thyself, and to all thy friends:
c49854	and they shall fall by the sword of their enemies,
c49855	and thine eyes shall behold
c49856	<i>it:</i> and I will give all Judah into the hand of the king of Babylon,
c49857	and he shall carry them captive into Babylon,
c49858	and shall slay them with the sword.
c49859	Moreover I will deliver all the strength of this city, and all the labours thereof, and all the precious things
c49860	thereof, and all the treasures of the kings of Judah will I give into the hand of their enemies,
c49861	which shall spoil
c49862	them, and take
c49863	them, and carry them to Babylon.
c49864	And thou,
c49865	Pashur,
c49866	and all that dwell in thine house shall go into captivity:
c49867	and thou shalt come to Babylon,
c49868	and there thou shalt die,
c49869	and shalt be buried there,
c49870	thou, and all thy friends,
c49871	to whom thou hast prophesied lies.
c49872	thou hast deceived
c49873	O LORD,
c49874	me, and I was deceived:
c49875	thou art stronger
c49876	than I, and hast prevailed:
c49877	I am in derision daily,
c49878	every one mocketh me.
c49879	For
c49880	since I spake,
c49881	I cried out,
c49882	I cried violence and spoil;
c49883	because the word of the LORD was made a reproach unto me, and a derision, daily.
c49884	Then I said,
c49885	I will not make mention
c49886	of him, nor speak any more in his name.
c49887	But <i>his word</i> was in mine heart as a burning fire
c49888	shut up in my bones,
c49889	and I was weary
c49890	with forbearing,
c49891	and I could not <i>stay.</i>
c49892	For I heard the defaming of many,
c49893	fear on every side.
c49894	Report,
c49895	<i>say they,</i> and we will report
c49896	it. All my familiars watched for my halting,
c49897	<i>saying,</i> Peradventure he will be enticed,
c49898	and we shall prevail
c49899	against him, and we shall take our revenge on him.
c49900	But the LORD <i>is</i> with me as a mighty terrible one:
c49901	therefore my persecutors shall stumble,
c49902	and they shall not prevail:
c49903	they shall be greatly ashamed;
c49904	for they shall not prosper:
c49905	<i>their</i> everlasting confusion shall never be forgotten.
c49906	But, O LORD of hosts, that triest the righteous,
c49907	<i>and</i> seest the reins and the heart,
c49908	let me see thy vengeance on
c49909	them: for unto thee have I opened my cause.
c49910	Sing unto the LORD,
c49911	praise ye the LORD:
c49912	for he hath delivered the soul of the poor from the hand of evildoers.
c49913	Cursed <i>be</i> the day
c49914	wherein I was born:
c49916	wherein my mother bare me be blessed.
c49917	let not the day
c49918	Cursed <i>be</i> the man
c49919	who brought tidings to my father,
c49920	saying,
c49921	A man child is born
c49922	unto thee; making him very glad.
c49923	And let that man be as the cities
c49924	which the LORD overthrew,
c49925	and repented not:
c49926	and let him hear the cry in the morning,
c49927	and the shouting at noontide;
c49928	Because he slew me not from the womb;
c49929	or that my mother might have been my grave,
c49930	and her womb <i>to be</i> always great <i>with me.</i>
c49931	Wherefore came I forth out of the womb
c49932	to see labour and sorrow,
c49933	that my days should be consumed with shame?
c49934	The word
c49935	which came unto Jeremiah from the LORD, when king Zedekiah sent unto him
c49936	Pashur the son of Melchiah, and Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah the priest,
c49937	saying,
c49938	Enquire, I pray thee, of the LORD for
c49939	us; for Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon maketh war against
c49940	us; if so be that the LORD will deal with us according to all his wondrous works,
c49941	that he may go up from us.
c49942	Then said Jeremiah unto
c49943	them, Thus shall ye say to Zedekiah:
c49944	Thus saith the LORD God of Israel;
c49945	Behold, I will turn back the weapons of war
c49946	that <i>are</i> in your hands,
c49947	wherewith ye fight against the king of Babylon, and <i>against</i> the Chaldeans,
c49948	which besiege
c49949	you without the walls,
c49950	and I will assemble them into the midst of this city.
c49951	And I myself will fight against you with an outstretched hand and with a strong arm, even in anger, and in fury, and in great wrath.
c49952	And I will smite the inhabitants of this city, both man and beast:
c49953	they shall die of a great pestilence.
c49954	And afterward,
c49955	saith the LORD,
c49956	I will deliver Zedekiah king of Judah, and his servants, and the people,
c49957	and such as are left in this city from the pestilence, from the sword, and from the famine,
c49958	into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, and into the hand of their enemies, and into the hand of those that seek their life:
c49959	and he shall smite them with the edge of the sword;
c49960	he shall not spare
c49961	them, neither have pity,
c49962	nor have mercy.
c49963	And unto this people thou shalt say,
c49964	Thus saith the LORD;
c49965	Behold, I set before you the way of life, and the way of death.
c49966	He that abideth in this city
c49967	shall die by the sword, and by the famine, and by the pestilence:
c49968	but he that goeth out,
c49969	and falleth to the Chaldeans
c49970	that besiege
c49971	you, he shall live,
c49972	and his life shall be unto him for a prey.
c49973	For I have set my face against this city for evil,
c49974	and not for good,
c49975	saith the LORD:
c49976	it shall be given into the hand of the king of Babylon,
c49977	and he shall burn it with fire.
c49978	And touching the house of the king of Judah,
c49979	<i>say,</i> Hear ye the word of the LORD;
c49980	O house of David,
c49981	thus saith the LORD;
c49982	Execute judgment in the morning,
c49983	and deliver <i>him that is</i> spoiled out of the hand of the oppressor,
c49984	lest my fury go out like fire,
c49985	and burn
c49986	that none can quench
c49987	<i>it,</i> because of the evil of your doings.
c49988	Behold, I <i>am</i> against
c49989	thee, O inhabitant of the valley,
c49990	<i>and</i> rock of the plain,
c49991	saith the LORD;
c49992	which say,
c49993	Who shall come down against
c49994	us? or who shall enter into our habitations?
c49995	But I will punish you according to the fruit of your doings,
c49996	saith the LORD:
c49997	and I will kindle a fire in the forest
c49998	thereof, and it shall devour all things round about it.
c49999	Thus saith the LORD;
c50000	Go down to the house of the king of Judah,
c50001	and speak there this word,
c50002	And say,
c50003	Hear the word of the LORD,
c50004	O king of Judah,
c50005	that sittest upon the throne of David,
c50006	thou, and thy servants, and thy people
c50007	that enter in by these gates:
c50008	Thus saith the LORD;
c50009	Execute ye judgment and righteousness,
c50010	and deliver the spoiled out of the hand of the oppressor:
c50011	and do no wrong, do no violence to the stranger, the fatherless, nor the widow,
c50013	neither shed innocent blood in this place.
c50014	For if ye do this thing indeed,
c50015	then shall there enter in by the gates of this house kings
c50016	sitting upon the throne of David,
c50017	riding in chariots and on horses,
c50018	he, and his servants, and his people.
c50019	But if ye will not hear these words,
c50020	I swear
c50021	by myself, saith the LORD,
c50022	that this house shall become a desolation.
c50023	For thus saith the LORD unto the king's house of Judah;
c50024	Thou <i>art</i> Gilead
c50025	unto me, <i>and</i> the head of Lebanon:
c50026	<i>yet</i> surely I will make thee a wilderness,
c50027	<i>and</i> cities
c50028	<i>which</i> are not inhabited.
c50029	And I will prepare destroyers against thee, every one with his weapons:
c50030	and they shall cut down thy choice cedars,
c50031	and cast <i>them</i> into the fire.
c50032	And many nations shall pass by this city,
c50033	and they shall say
c50034	every man to his neighbour,
c50035	Wherefore hath the LORD done thus unto this great city?
c50036	Then they shall answer,
c50037	Because they have forsaken the covenant of the LORD their God,
c50038	and worshipped other gods,
c50039	and served them.
c50040	Weep ye not for the dead,
c50041	neither bemoan
c50042	him: <i>but</i> weep sore for him that goeth away:
c50043	for he shall return no more,
c50044	nor see his native country.
c50045	For thus saith the LORD touching Shallum the son of Josiah king of Judah,
c50046	which reigned instead of Josiah his father,
c50047	which went forth out of this place;
c50048	He shall not return thither any more:
c50049	But he shall die in the place
c50050	whither they have led him captive,
c50052	and shall see this land no more.
c50053	Woe
c50054	unto him that buildeth his house by unrighteousness,
c50055	and his chambers by wrong;
c50056	<i>that</i> useth his neighbour's service without wages,
c50057	and giveth him not for his work;
c50058	That saith,
c50059	I will build me a wide house and large chambers,
c50060	and cutteth him out windows;
c50061	and <i>it is</i> cieled with cedar,
c50062	and painted with vermilion.
c50063	Shalt thou reign,
c50064	because thou closest <i>thyself</i> in cedar?
c50066	did not thy father eat
c50067	and drink,
c50068	and do judgment and justice,
c50069	<i>and</i> then <i>it was</i> well with him?
c50070	He judged the cause of the poor and needy;
c50071	then <i>it was</i> well
c50072	<i>with him: was</i> not this to know
c50073	me? saith the LORD.
c50074	But thine eyes and thine heart <i>are</i> not
c50075	but for thy covetousness, and for to shed innocent blood,
c50077	and for oppression, and for violence,
c50078	to do <i>it.</i>
c50079	Therefore
c50080	thus saith the LORD concerning Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah;
c50081	They shall not lament
c50082	for him, <i>saying,</i> Ah my brother!
c50083	or, Ah sister!
c50084	they shall not lament
c50085	for him, <i>saying,</i> Ah lord!
c50086	or, Ah his glory!
c50087	He shall be buried with the burial of an ass,
c50088	drawn
c50089	and cast forth beyond the gates of Jerusalem.
c50090	Go up to Lebanon,
c50091	and cry;
c50092	and lift up thy voice in Bashan,
c50093	and cry from the passages:
c50094	for all thy lovers are destroyed.
c50095	I spake unto thee in thy prosperity;
c50096	<i>but</i> thou saidst,
c50097	I will not hear.
c50098	This <i>hath been</i> thy manner from thy youth,
c50099	that thou obeyedst not my voice.
c50100	The wind shall eat up all thy pastors,
c50101	and thy lovers shall go into captivity:
c50102	surely then shalt thou be ashamed
c50103	and confounded for all thy wickedness.
c50104	O inhabitant of Lebanon,
c50105	that makest thy nest in the cedars,
c50106	how gracious
c50107	shalt thou be when pangs come
c50108	upon thee, the pain as of a woman in travail!
c50109	<i>As</i> I live,
c50110	saith the LORD,
c50111	though Coniah the son of Jehoiakim king of Judah were the signet upon my right hand,
c50112	yet would I pluck thee thence;
c50113	And I will give thee into the hand of them that seek thy life, and into the hand
c50114	<i>of them</i> whose face thou fearest,
c50115	even into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, and into the hand of the Chaldeans.
c50116	And I will cast thee out, and thy mother
c50117	that bare
c50118	thee, into another country,
c50119	where ye were not born;
c50120	and there shall ye die.
c50121	But to the land
c50122	whereunto they desire
c50123	to return,
c50124	thither shall they not return.
c50125	<i>Is</i> this man Coniah a despised broken idol?
c50126	<i>is he</i> a vessel
c50127	wherein <i>is</i> no pleasure?
c50128	wherefore are they cast out, he and his seed,
c50129	and are cast into a land
c50130	which they know not?
c50131	O earth, earth, earth,
c50132	hear the word of the LORD.
c50133	Thus saith the LORD,
c50134	Write ye this man childless,
c50135	a man
c50136	<i>that</i> shall not prosper in his days:
c50137	for no man of his seed shall prosper,
c50138	sitting upon the throne of David,
c50139	and ruling any more in Judah.
c50140	Woe be unto the pastors
c50141	that destroy
c50142	and scatter the sheep of my pasture!
c50143	saith the LORD.
c50144	Therefore thus saith the LORD God of Israel against the pastors
c50145	that feed my people;
c50146	Ye have scattered my flock,
c50147	and driven them away,
c50148	and have not visited
c50149	them: behold, I will visit upon you the evil of your doings,
c50150	saith the LORD.
c50151	And I will gather the remnant of my flock out of all countries
c50152	whither I have driven
c50153	them, and will bring them again to their folds;
c50154	and they shall be fruitful
c50155	and increase.
c50156	And I will set up shepherds over
c50157	them which shall feed
c50158	them: and they shall fear no more,
c50159	nor be dismayed,
c50160	neither shall they be lacking,
c50161	saith the LORD.
c50162	Behold, the days come,
c50163	saith the LORD,
c50164	that I will raise unto David a righteous Branch,
c50165	and a King shall reign
c50166	and prosper,
c50167	and shall execute judgment and justice in the earth.
c50168	In his days Judah shall be saved,
c50169	and Israel shall dwell safely:
c50170	and this <i>is</i> his name
c50171	whereby he shall be called,
c50172	THE LORD OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS.
c50173	Therefore, behold, the days come,
c50174	saith the LORD,
c50175	that they shall no more say,
c50176	The LORD liveth,
c50177	which brought up the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt;
c50178	But,
c50179	The LORD liveth,
c50180	which brought up
c50181	and which led the seed of the house of Israel out of the north country, and from all countries
c50182	whither I had driven
c50183	them; and they shall dwell in their own land.
c50184	because of the prophets;
c50185	Mine heart within me is broken
c50186	all my bones shake;
c50187	I am like a drunken man, and like a man
c50188	whom wine hath overcome,
c50189	because of the LORD, and because of the words of his holiness.
c50190	For the land is full of adulterers;
c50191	for because of swearing the land mourneth;
c50192	the pleasant places of the wilderness are dried up,
c50193	and their course is evil,
c50194	and their force <i>is</i> not right.
c50195	For both prophet and priest are profane;
c50196	yea, in my house have I found their wickedness,
c50197	saith the LORD.
c50198	Wherefore their way shall be unto them as slippery <i>ways</i> in the darkness:
c50199	they shall be driven on,
c50200	and fall
c50201	therein: for I will bring evil upon them, <i>even</i> the year of their visitation,
c50202	saith the LORD.
c50203	And I have seen folly in the prophets of Samaria;
c50204	they prophesied in Baal,
c50205	and caused my people Israel to err.
c50206	I have seen also in the prophets of Jerusalem an horrible thing:
c50207	they commit adultery,
c50208	and walk in lies:
c50209	they strengthen also the hands of evildoers,
c50210	that none doth return
c50211	from his wickedness:
c50212	they are all of them unto me as Sodom,
c50213	and the inhabitants thereof as Gomorrah.
c50214	Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts concerning the prophets;
c50215	Behold, I will feed them with wormwood,
c50216	and make them drink the water of gall:
c50217	for from the prophets of Jerusalem is profaneness gone forth into all the land.
c50218	Thus saith the LORD of hosts,
c50219	Hearken not unto the words of the prophets
c50220	that prophesy
c50221	unto you: they make you vain: they
c50222	speak a vision of their own heart,
c50223	<i>and</i> not out of the mouth of the LORD.
c50224	They say still unto them that despise
c50225	me, The LORD hath said,
c50226	Ye shall have peace;
c50227	unto every one that walketh after the imagination of his own heart,
c50228	and they say
c50229	No evil shall come upon you.
c50230	For who hath stood in the counsel of the LORD,
c50231	and hath perceived
c50232	and heard his word?
c50233	who hath marked his word,
c50234	and heard <i>it?</i>
c50235	Behold, a whirlwind of the LORD
c50236	is gone forth in fury,
c50237	even a grievous whirlwind:
c50238	it shall fall grievously upon the head of the wicked.
c50239	The anger of the LORD shall not return,
c50240	until he have executed,
c50241	and till he have performed the thoughts of his heart:
c50242	in the latter days ye shall consider it perfectly.
c50243	I have not sent these prophets,
c50244	yet they ran:
c50245	I have not spoken to
c50246	them, yet they prophesied.
c50247	But if they had stood in my counsel,
c50248	and had caused my people to hear my words,
c50249	then they should have turned them from their evil way, and from the evil of their doings.
c50250	<i>Am</i> I a God at hand,
c50251	saith the LORD,
c50252	and not a God afar off?
c50253	Can any hide himself in secret places
c50254	that I shall not see
c50255	him? saith the LORD.
c50256	Do not I fill heaven and earth?
c50257	saith the LORD.
c50258	I have heard
c50259	what the prophets said,
c50260	that prophesy lies in my name,
c50261	saying,
c50262	I have dreamed,
c50263	I have dreamed.
c50264	How long
c50265	shall <i>this</i> be in the heart of the prophets that prophesy lies? yea, <i>they are</i> prophets of the deceit of their own heart;
c50266	Which think
c50267	to cause my people to forget my name by their dreams
c50268	which they tell
c50269	every man to his neighbour,
c50270	as their fathers have forgotten my name for Baal.
c50271	The prophet
c50272	that hath a dream,
c50273	let him tell a dream;
c50275	and he that hath my word,
c50276	let him speak my word faithfully.
c50277	What <i>is</i> the chaff to the wheat?
c50278	saith the LORD.
c50279	<i>Is</i> not my word like
c50280	as a fire?
c50281	saith the LORD;
c50282	and like a hammer
c50283	<i>that</i> breaketh the rock in pieces?
c50284	Therefore, behold, I <i>am</i> against the prophets,
c50285	saith the LORD,
c50286	that steal my words every one from his neighbour.
c50287	Behold, I <i>am</i> against the prophets,
c50288	saith the LORD,
c50289	that use their tongues,
c50290	and say, He saith.
c50291	Behold, I <i>am</i> against them that prophesy false dreams,
c50292	saith the LORD,
c50293	and do tell
c50294	them, and cause my people to err by their lies, and by their lightness;
c50295	yet I sent them not,
c50296	nor commanded
c50297	them: therefore they shall not profit this people at all,
c50298	saith the LORD.
c50299	And when this people, or the prophet, or a priest, shall ask
c50300	thee, saying,
c50301	What <i>is</i> the burden of the LORD?
c50302	thou shalt then say unto
c50303	them, What burden?
c50304	I will even forsake
c50305	you, saith the LORD.
c50306	And <i>as for</i> the prophet, and the priest, and the people,
c50307	that shall say,
c50308	The burden of the LORD,
c50309	I will even punish that man and his house.
c50310	Thus shall ye say
c50311	every one to his neighbour,
c50312	and every one to his brother,
c50313	What hath the LORD answered?
c50314	and, What hath the LORD spoken?
c50315	And the burden of the LORD shall ye mention no more:
c50316	for every man's word shall be his burden;
c50317	for ye have perverted the words of the living God, of the LORD of hosts our God.
c50318	Thus shalt thou say to the prophet,
c50319	What hath the LORD answered
c50320	thee? and, What hath the LORD spoken?
c50321	But since
c50322	The burden of the LORD;
c50323	ye say,
c50324	therefore thus saith the LORD;
c50325	Because ye say this word,
c50326	The burden of the LORD,
c50327	and I have sent unto
c50328	you, saying,
c50329	Ye shall not say,
c50330	The burden of the LORD;
c50331	Therefore, behold,
c50332	I, even I, will utterly forget
c50333	you, and I will forsake you, and the city
c50334	that I gave you and your fathers,
c50335	<i>and cast you</i> out of my presence:
c50336	And I will bring an everlasting reproach upon you, and a perpetual shame,
c50337	which shall not be forgotten.
c50338	The LORD shewed
c50339	me, and, behold, two baskets of figs <i>were</i> set before the temple of the LORD,
c50340	after that Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon had carried away captive Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim king of Judah, and the princes of Judah, with the carpenters and smiths, from Jerusalem,
c50341	and had brought them to Babylon.
c50342	One basket <i>had</i> very good figs, <i>even</i> like the figs <i>that are</i> first ripe:
c50343	and the other basket <i>had</i> very naughty figs,
c50344	which could not be eaten, they were so bad.
c50345	Then said the LORD unto
c50346	me, What seest thou,
c50347	Jeremiah?
c50348	And I said,
c50349	Figs;
c50350	the good figs, very good;
c50351	and the evil, very evil,
c50352	that cannot be eaten, they are so evil.
c50353	Again the word of the LORD came unto
c50354	me, saying,
c50355	Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel;
c50356	Like these good figs,
c50357	so will I acknowledge them that are carried away captive of Judah,
c50358	whom I have sent out of this place into the land of the Chaldeans
c50359	for <i>their</i> good.
c50360	For I will set mine eyes upon them for good,
c50361	and I will bring them again to this land:
c50362	and I will build
c50363	them, and not pull <i>them</i> down;
c50364	and I will plant
c50365	them, and not pluck <i>them</i> up.
c50366	And I will give them an heart
c50367	to know
c50368	me, that I <i>am</i> the LORD:
c50369	and they shall be my people,
c50370	and I will be their God:
c50371	for they shall return unto me with their whole heart.
c50372	And as the evil figs,
c50373	which cannot be eaten, they are so evil;
c50374	surely thus saith the LORD,
c50375	So will I give Zedekiah the king of Judah, and his princes, and the residue of Jerusalem,
c50376	that remain in this land,
c50377	and them that dwell in the land of Egypt:
c50378	And I will deliver them to be removed into all the kingdoms of the earth for <i>their</i> hurt,
c50379	<i>to be</i> a reproach and a proverb, a taunt and a curse, in all places
c50380	whither I shall drive them.
c50381	And I will send the sword, the famine, and the pestilence,
c50382	among them, till they be consumed from off the land
c50383	that I gave unto them and to their fathers.
c50384	The word
c50385	that came to Jeremiah concerning all the people of Judah in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah,
c50386	that <i>was</i> the first year of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon;
c50387	The which Jeremiah the prophet spake unto all the people of Judah, and to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem,
c50388	saying,
c50389	From the thirteenth year of Josiah the son of Amon king of Judah, even unto this day,
c50390	that <i>is</i> the three and twentieth year,
c50391	the word of the LORD hath come unto
c50392	me, and I have spoken unto
c50393	you, rising early
c50394	and speaking;
c50395	but ye have not hearkened.
c50396	And the LORD hath sent unto you all his servants the prophets,
c50397	rising early
c50398	and sending
c50399	<i>them;</i> but ye have not hearkened,
c50400	nor inclined your ear
c50401	to hear.
c50402	They said,
c50403	Turn ye again now every one from his evil way, and from the evil of your doings,
c50404	and dwell in the land
c50405	that the LORD hath given unto you and to your fathers for ever and ever:
c50406	And go not after other gods
c50407	to serve
c50408	them, and to worship
c50409	them, and provoke me not to anger with the works of your hands;
c50410	and I will do you no hurt.
c50411	Yet ye have not hearkened unto
c50412	me, saith the LORD;
c50413	that ye might provoke me to anger with the works of your hands to your own hurt.
c50414	Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts;
c50415	Because ye have not heard my words,
c50416	Behold, I will send
c50417	and take all the families of the north,
c50418	saith the LORD,
c50419	and Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon, my servant,
c50420	and will bring them against this land, and against the inhabitants thereof, and against all these nations round about,
c50421	and will utterly destroy
c50422	them, and make them an astonishment, and an hissing, and perpetual desolations.
c50423	Moreover I will take from them the voice of mirth, and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the bride, the sound of the millstones, and the light of the candle.
c50424	And this whole land shall be a desolation, <i>and</i> an astonishment;
c50425	and these nations shall serve the king of Babylon seventy years.
c50426	And it shall come to pass,
c50427	when seventy years are accomplished,
c50428	<i>that</i> I will punish the king of Babylon, and that nation,
c50429	saith the LORD,
c50430	for their iniquity,
c50431	and the land of the Chaldeans,
c50432	and will make it perpetual desolations.
c50433	And I will bring upon that land all my words
c50434	which I have pronounced against
c50435	it, <i>even</i> all that is written in this book,
c50436	which Jeremiah hath prophesied against all the nations.
c50437	For many nations and great kings shall serve themselves of them also:
c50438	and I will recompense them according to their deeds, and according to the works of their own hands.
c50439	For thus saith the LORD God of Israel unto
c50440	me; Take the wine cup of this fury at my hand,
c50441	and cause all the nations, to whom I send thee, to drink it.
c50443	And they shall drink,
c50444	and be moved,
c50445	and be mad, because of the sword
c50446	that I will send among them.
c50447	Then took I the cup at the LORD'S hand,
c50448	and made all the nations to drink,
c50449	unto whom the LORD had sent me:
c50450	<i>To wit,</i> Jerusalem, and the cities of Judah, and the kings thereof, and the princes
c50451	thereof, to make them a desolation, an astonishment, an hissing, and a curse; as <i>it is</i> this day;
c50452	Pharaoh king of Egypt, and his servants, and his princes, and all his people;
c50453	And all the mingled people, and all the kings of the land of Uz, and all the kings of the land of the Philistines, and Ashkelon, and Azzah, and Ekron, and the remnant of Ashdod,
c50454	Edom, and Moab, and the children of Ammon,
c50455	And all the kings of Tyrus, and all the kings of Zidon, and the kings of the isles
c50456	which <i>are</i> beyond the sea,
c50457	Dedan, and Tema, and Buz, and all <i>that are</i> in the utmost corners,
c50458	And all the kings of Arabia, and all the kings of the mingled people
c50459	that dwell in the desert,
c50460	And all the kings of Zimri, and all the kings of Elam, and all the kings of the Medes,
c50461	And all the kings of the north, far and near,
c50462	one with another,
c50463	and all the kingdoms of the world,
c50464	which <i>are</i> upon the face of the earth:
c50465	and the king of Sheshach shall drink after them.
c50466	Therefore thou shalt say unto
c50467	them, Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel;
c50468	Drink
c50469	ye, and be drunken,
c50470	and spue,
c50471	and fall,
c50472	and rise no more, because of the sword
c50473	which I will send among you.
c50474	And it shall be,
c50475	if they refuse
c50476	to take the cup at thine hand
c50477	to drink,
c50478	then shalt thou say unto
c50479	them, Thus saith the LORD of hosts;
c50480	Ye shall certainly drink.
c50481	For, lo, I begin
c50482	which is called by my name,
c50484	to bring evil on the city
c50485	and should ye be utterly unpunished?
c50486	Ye shall not be unpunished:
c50487	for I will call for a sword upon all the inhabitants of the earth,
c50488	saith the LORD of hosts.
c50489	Therefore prophesy thou against them all these words,
c50490	and say unto
c50491	them, The LORD shall roar from on high,
c50492	and utter his voice from his holy habitation;
c50493	he shall mightily roar upon his habitation;
c50494	he shall give a shout, as they that tread <i>the grapes,</i> against all the inhabitants of the earth.
c50495	A noise shall come <i>even</i> to the ends of the earth;
c50496	for the LORD hath a controversy with the nations,
c50497	he will plead with all flesh;
c50499	he will give them <i>that are</i> wicked to the sword,
c50500	saith the LORD.
c50501	Thus saith the LORD of hosts,
c50502	Behold, evil shall go forth from nation to nation,
c50503	and a great whirlwind shall be raised up from the coasts of the earth.
c50504	And the slain of the LORD shall be at that day from <i>one</i> end of the earth even unto the <i>other</i> end of the earth:
c50505	they shall not be lamented,
c50506	neither gathered,
c50507	nor buried;
c50508	they shall be dung upon the ground.
c50509	Howl,
c50510	ye shepherds,
c50511	and cry;
c50512	and wallow yourselves
c50513	<i>in the ashes,</i> ye principal of the flock:
c50514	for the days of your slaughter
c50516	and of your dispersions are accomplished;
c50517	and ye shall fall like a pleasant vessel.
c50518	And the shepherds shall have no way to flee,
c50519	nor the principal of the flock to escape.
c50520	A voice of the cry of the shepherds, and an howling of the principal of the flock,
c50521	<i>shall be heard:</i> for the LORD hath spoiled their pasture.
c50522	And the peaceable habitations are cut down because of the fierce anger of the LORD.
c50523	He hath forsaken his covert, as the lion:
c50524	for their land is desolate because of the fierceness of the oppressor, and because of his fierce anger.
c50525	In the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah came this word from the LORD,
c50526	saying,
c50527	Thus saith the LORD;
c50528	Stand in the court of the LORD'S house,
c50529	and speak unto all the cities of Judah,
c50530	which come
c50531	to worship in the LORD'S house,
c50532	all the words
c50533	that I command
c50534	thee to speak unto
c50535	them; diminish not a word:
c50536	If so be they will hearken,
c50537	and turn every man from his evil way,
c50538	that I may repent me of the evil,
c50539	which I purpose
c50540	to do unto them because of the evil of their doings.
c50541	And thou shalt say unto
c50542	them, Thus saith the LORD;
c50543	If ye will not hearken to
c50544	me, to walk in my law,
c50545	which I have set before you,
c50546	To hearken to the words of my servants the prophets,
c50547	whom I sent unto
c50548	you, both rising up early,
c50549	and sending
c50550	<i>them,</i> but ye have not hearkened;
c50551	Then will I make this house like Shiloh,
c50552	and will make this city a curse to all the nations of the earth.
c50553	So the priests and the prophets and all the people heard Jeremiah
c50554	speaking these words in the house of the LORD.
c50555	Now it came to pass,
c50556	when Jeremiah had made an end
c50557	of speaking all
c50558	that the LORD had commanded
c50559	<i>him</i> to speak unto all the people,
c50560	that the priests and the prophets and all the people took
c50561	him, saying,
c50562	Thou shalt surely die.
c50563	Why hast thou prophesied in the name of the LORD,
c50564	saying,
c50565	This house shall be like Shiloh,
c50566	and this city shall be desolate without an inhabitant?
c50567	And all the people were gathered against Jeremiah in the house of the LORD.
c50568	When the princes of Judah heard these things,
c50569	then they came up from the king's house unto the house of the LORD,
c50570	and sat down in the entry of the new gate of the LORD'S <i>house.</i>
c50571	Then spake the priests and the prophets unto the princes and to all the people,
c50572	saying,
c50573	This man <i>is</i> worthy to die;
c50574	for he hath prophesied against this city,
c50575	as ye have heard with your ears.
c50576	Then spake Jeremiah unto all the princes and to all the people,
c50577	saying,
c50578	The LORD sent
c50579	me to prophesy against this house and against this city all the words
c50580	that ye have heard.
c50581	Therefore now
c50582	amend your ways and your doings,
c50583	and obey the voice of the LORD your God;
c50584	and the LORD will repent him of the evil
c50585	that he hath pronounced against you.
c50586	As for me,
c50587	behold, I <i>am</i> in your hand:
c50588	do with me as seemeth good and meet unto you.
c50589	But know ye for certain,
c50590	that
c50591	if ye put me to death,
c50592	ye shall surely bring innocent blood upon yourselves, and upon this city, and upon the inhabitants
c50593	thereof: for of a truth the LORD hath sent me unto
c50594	you to speak all these words in your ears.
c50595	Then said the princes and all the people unto the priests and to the prophets;
c50596	This man <i>is</i> not worthy to die:
c50597	for he hath spoken to us in the name of the LORD our God.
c50598	Then rose up certain of the elders of the land,
c50599	and spake to all the assembly of the people,
c50600	saying,
c50601	Micah the Morasthite prophesied in the days of Hezekiah king of Judah,
c50602	and spake to all the people of Judah,
c50603	saying,
c50604	Thus saith the LORD of hosts;
c50605	Zion shall be plowed <i>like</i> a field,
c50606	and Jerusalem shall become heaps,
c50607	and the mountain of the house as the high places of a forest.
c50608	Did Hezekiah king of Judah and all Judah put him at all to death?
c50609	did he not fear the LORD,
c50610	and besought the LORD,
c50611	and the LORD repented him of the evil
c50612	which he had pronounced against
c50613	them? Thus might we procure great evil against our souls.
c50614	And there was also a man that prophesied in the name of the LORD,
c50615	Urijah the son of Shemaiah of Kirjathjearim,
c50616	who prophesied against this city and against this land according to all the words of Jeremiah:
c50617	And when Jehoiakim the king, with all his mighty men, and all the princes, heard his words,
c50618	the king sought
c50619	to put him to death:
c50620	but when Urijah heard
c50621	it, he was afraid,
c50622	and fled,
c50623	and went into Egypt;
c50624	And Jehoiakim the king sent men into Egypt,
c50625	<i>namely,</i> Elnathan the son of Achbor, and <i>certain</i> men with him into Egypt.
c50626	And they fetched forth Urijah out of Egypt,
c50627	and brought him unto Jehoiakim the king;
c50628	who slew him with the sword,
c50629	and cast his dead body into the graves of the common people.
c50630	Nevertheless the hand of Ahikam the son of Shaphan was with Jeremiah,
c50631	that they should not give him into the hand of the people
c50632	to put him to death.
c50633	In the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah came this word unto Jeremiah from the LORD,
c50634	saying,
c50635	Thus saith the LORD to
c50636	me; Make thee bonds and yokes,
c50637	and put them upon thy neck,
c50638	And send them to the king of Edom, and to the king of Moab, and to the king of the Ammonites, and to the king of Tyrus, and to the king of Zidon, by the hand of the messengers which come to Jerusalem unto
c50639	Zedekiah king of Judah;
c50640	And command them to say unto their masters,
c50642	Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel;
c50643	Thus shall ye say unto your masters;
c50644	I have made the earth, the man and the beast
c50645	that <i>are</i> upon the ground,
c50646	by my great power and by my outstretched arm,
c50647	and have given
c50648	it unto whom it seemed meet unto me.
c50649	And now
c50650	have I given all these lands into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, my servant;
c50651	and the beasts of the field have I given him also
c50652	to serve him.
c50653	And all nations shall serve him, and his son, and his son's son,
c50654	until the very time of his land come: and then many nations and great kings shall serve themselves of him.
c50656	And it shall come to pass,
c50657	<i>that</i> the nation and kingdom
c50658	which will not serve the same Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon,
c50659	and that will not put their neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon,
c50660	that nation will I punish, saith the LORD, with the sword, and with the famine, and with the pestilence,
c50662	until I have consumed them by his hand.
c50664	Therefore hearken not ye to your prophets, nor to your diviners, nor to your dreamers, nor to your enchanters, nor to your sorcerers,
c50665	which speak unto
c50666	you, saying,
c50667	Ye shall not serve the king of Babylon:
c50668	For they prophesy a lie
c50669	unto you, to remove you far from your land;
c50670	and that I should drive you out,
c50671	and ye should perish.
c50672	But the nations
c50673	that bring their neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon,
c50674	and serve
c50675	him, those will I let remain still in their own land,
c50676	saith the LORD;
c50677	and they shall till
c50678	it, and dwell therein.
c50679	I spake also to Zedekiah king of Judah according to all these words,
c50680	saying,
c50681	Bring your necks under the yoke of the king of Babylon,
c50682	and serve him and his people,
c50683	and live.
c50684	Why will ye die, thou and thy people, by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence,
c50685	as the LORD hath spoken against the nation
c50686	that will not serve the king of Babylon?
c50687	Therefore hearken not unto the words of the prophets
c50688	that speak unto
c50689	you, saying,
c50690	Ye shall not serve the king of Babylon:
c50691	for they prophesy a lie unto you.
c50692	For I have not sent
c50693	them, saith the LORD,
c50694	yet they prophesy a lie in my name;
c50695	that I might drive you out,
c50696	and that ye might perish, ye, and the prophets
c50697	that prophesy unto you.
c50698	Also I spake to the priests and to all this people,
c50699	saying,
c50700	Thus saith the LORD;
c50701	Hearken not to the words of your prophets
c50702	that prophesy
c50703	unto you, saying,
c50704	Behold, the vessels of the LORD'S house shall now shortly be brought again from Babylon:
c50705	for they prophesy a lie unto you.
c50706	Hearken not unto
c50707	them; serve the king of Babylon,
c50708	and live:
c50709	wherefore should this city be laid waste?
c50710	But if they <i>be</i> prophets,
c50711	and if the word of the LORD be with
c50712	them, let them now make intercession to the LORD of hosts,
c50713	that the vessels which are left in the house of the LORD, and <i>in</i> the house of the king of Judah, and at Jerusalem, go not
c50715	to Babylon.
c50716	For thus saith the LORD of hosts concerning the pillars, and concerning the sea, and concerning the bases, and concerning the residue of the vessels
c50717	that remain in this city,
c50718	Which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon took not,
c50719	when he carried away captive Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim king of Judah from Jerusalem to Babylon,
c50720	and all the nobles of Judah and Jerusalem;
c50721	Yea, thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, concerning the vessels
c50722	that remain <i>in</i> the house of the LORD, and <i>in</i> the house of the king of Judah and of Jerusalem;
c50723	They shall be carried to Babylon,
c50724	and there shall they be until the day
c50725	that I visit
c50726	them, saith the LORD;
c50727	then will I bring them up,
c50728	and restore them to this place.
c50729	And it came to pass the same year, in the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah,
c50730	in the fourth year, <i>and</i> in the fifth month, <i>that</i> Hananiah the son of Azur the prophet, which <i>was</i> of Gibeon, spake unto
c50732	me in the house of the LORD, in the presence of the priests and of all the people,
c50733	saying,
c50734	Thus speaketh the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel,
c50735	saying,
c50736	I have broken the yoke of the king of Babylon.
c50737	Within two full years will I bring again into this place all the vessels of the LORD'S house,
c50738	that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon took away from this place,
c50739	and carried them to Babylon:
c50740	Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim king of Judah, with all the captives of Judah,
c50741	that went into Babylon,
c50742	And I will bring again to this place
c50743	saith the LORD:
c50744	for I will break the yoke of the king of Babylon.
c50745	Then the prophet Jeremiah said unto the prophet Hananiah in the presence of the priests, and in the presence of all the people
c50746	that stood in the house of the LORD,
c50747	Even the prophet Jeremiah said,
c50748	Amen:
c50749	the LORD do so:
c50750	the LORD perform thy words
c50751	which thou hast prophesied,
c50752	to bring again the vessels of the LORD'S house, and all that is carried away captive, from Babylon into this place.
c50753	Nevertheless hear thou now this word
c50754	that I speak in thine ears, and in the ears of all the people;
c50755	The prophets
c50756	that have been before me and before thee of old
c50757	prophesied both against many countries, and against great kingdoms, of war, and of evil, and of pestilence.
c50758	The prophet
c50759	which prophesieth of peace,
c50760	when the word of the prophet shall come to pass,
c50761	<i>then</i> shall the prophet be known,
c50762	that the LORD hath truly sent him.
c50763	Then Hananiah the prophet took the yoke from off the prophet Jeremiah's neck,
c50764	and brake it.
c50765	And Hananiah spake in the presence of all the people,
c50766	saying,
c50767	Thus saith the LORD;
c50768	Even so will I break the yoke of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon from the neck of all nations within the space of two full years.
c50769	And the prophet Jeremiah went his way.
c50770	Then the word of the LORD came unto Jeremiah
c50771	<i>the prophet,</i> after that Hananiah the prophet had broken the yoke from off the neck of the prophet Jeremiah,
c50772	saying,
c50773	Go
c50774	and tell Hananiah,
c50775	saying,
c50776	Thus saith the LORD;
c50777	Thou hast broken the yokes of wood;
c50778	but thou shalt make for them yokes of iron.
c50779	For thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel;
c50780	I have put a yoke of iron upon the neck of all these nations,
c50781	that they may serve Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon;
c50782	and they shall serve
c50783	him: and I have given him the beasts of the field also.
c50784	Then said the prophet Jeremiah unto Hananiah the prophet,
c50785	Hear now,
c50786	Hananiah;
c50787	The LORD hath not sent
c50788	thee; but thou makest this people to trust in a lie.
c50789	Therefore thus saith the LORD;
c50790	Behold, I will cast thee from off the face of the earth:
c50791	this year thou shalt die,
c50792	because thou hast taught rebellion against the LORD.
c50793	So Hananiah the prophet died the same year in the seventh month.
c50794	Now these <i>are</i> the words of the letter
c50795	that Jeremiah the prophet sent from Jerusalem unto the residue of the elders which were carried away captives, and to the priests, and to the prophets, and to all the people
c50796	whom Nebuchadnezzar had carried away captive from Jerusalem to Babylon;
c50797	(After that Jeconiah the king, and the queen, and the eunuchs, the princes of Judah and Jerusalem, and the carpenters, and the smiths, were departed from Jerusalem;)
c50798	By the hand of Elasah the son of Shaphan, and Gemariah the son of Hilkiah,
c50799	(whom Zedekiah king of Judah sent unto Babylon to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon)
c50800	saying,
c50801	Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, unto all that are carried away captives,
c50802	whom I have caused to be carried away from Jerusalem unto Babylon;
c50803	Build ye houses,
c50804	and dwell
c50805	<i>in them;</i> and plant gardens,
c50806	and eat the fruit of them;
c50807	Take ye wives,
c50808	and beget sons and daughters;
c50809	and take wives for your sons,
c50810	and give your daughters to husbands,
c50811	that they may bear sons and daughters;
c50812	that ye may be increased there,
c50813	and not diminished.
c50814	And seek the peace of the city
c50815	whither I have caused you to be carried away captives,
c50816	and pray unto the LORD for
c50817	it: for in the peace thereof shall ye have peace.
c50818	For thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel;
c50819	Let not your prophets and your diviners,
c50820	that <i>be</i> in the midst of you, deceive
c50822	you, neither hearken to your dreams
c50823	which ye cause to be dreamed.
c50824	For they prophesy falsely unto you in my name:
c50825	I have not sent
c50826	them, saith the LORD.
c50827	For thus saith the LORD,
c50828	That after
c50829	seventy years be accomplished at Babylon
c50830	I will visit
c50831	you, and perform my good word toward
c50832	you, in causing you to return to this place.
c50833	For I know the thoughts
c50834	that I think toward
c50835	you, saith the LORD,
c50836	thoughts of peace,
c50837	and not of evil,
c50838	to give you an expected end.
c50839	Then shall ye call upon
c50840	me, and ye shall go
c50841	and pray unto
c50842	me, and I will hearken unto you.
c50843	And ye shall seek
c50844	me, and find
c50845	<i>me,</i> when ye shall search for me with all your heart.
c50846	And I will be found
c50847	of you, saith the LORD:
c50848	and I will turn away your captivity,
c50849	and I will gather you from all the nations, and from all the places
c50850	whither I have driven
c50851	you, saith the LORD;
c50852	and I will bring you again into the place
c50853	whence I caused you to be carried away captive.
c50854	Because ye have said,
c50855	The LORD hath raised us up prophets in Babylon;
c50856	<i>Know</i> that thus saith the LORD of the king
c50857	that sitteth upon the throne of David,
c50858	and of all the people
c50859	that dwelleth in this city,
c50860	<i>and</i> of your brethren
c50861	that are not gone forth with you into captivity;
c50862	Thus saith the LORD of hosts;
c50863	Behold, I will send upon them the sword, the famine, and the pestilence,
c50864	and will make them like vile figs,
c50865	that cannot be eaten, they are so evil.
c50866	And I will persecute them with the sword, with the famine, and with the pestilence,
c50867	and will deliver them to be removed to all the kingdoms of the earth,
c50868	to be a curse, and an astonishment, and an hissing, and a reproach, among all the nations
c50869	whither I have driven them:
c50870	Because they have not hearkened to my words,
c50871	saith the LORD,
c50872	which I sent unto them by my servants the prophets,
c50873	rising up early
c50874	and sending
c50875	<i>them;</i> but ye would not hear,
c50876	saith the LORD.
c50877	Hear ye therefore the word of the LORD,
c50878	all ye of the captivity,
c50879	whom I have sent from Jerusalem to Babylon:
c50880	Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, of Ahab the son of Kolaiah, and of Zedekiah the son of Maaseiah,
c50881	which prophesy a lie unto you in my name;
c50882	Behold, I will deliver them into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon;
c50883	and he shall slay them before your eyes;
c50884	And of them shall be taken up a curse by all the captivity of Judah
c50885	which <i>are</i> in Babylon,
c50886	saying,
c50887	The LORD make thee like Zedekiah and like Ahab,
c50888	whom the king of Babylon roasted in the fire;
c50889	Because they have committed villany in Israel,
c50890	and have committed adultery with their neighbours' wives,
c50891	and have spoken lying words in my name,
c50892	which I have not commanded
c50893	them; even I
c50894	know,
c50895	and <i>am</i> a witness,
c50896	saith the LORD.
c50897	<i>Thus</i> shalt thou also speak to Shemaiah the Nehelamite,
c50898	saying,
c50899	Thus speaketh the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel,
c50900	saying,
c50901	Because thou hast sent letters in thy name unto all the people
c50902	that <i>are</i> at Jerusalem,
c50903	and to Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah the priest, and to all the priests,
c50904	saying,
c50905	The LORD hath made thee priest in the stead of Jehoiada the priest,
c50906	that ye should be officers in the house of the LORD, for every man <i>that is</i> mad, and maketh himself a prophet,
c50907	that thou shouldest put him in prison, and in the stocks.
c50908	Now
c50909	therefore why hast thou not reproved Jeremiah of Anathoth,
c50910	which maketh himself a prophet to you?
c50911	For therefore he sent unto us <i>in</i> Babylon,
c50912	saying,
c50913	This <i>captivity is</i> long:
c50914	build ye houses,
c50915	and dwell
c50916	<i>in them;</i> and plant gardens,
c50917	and eat the fruit of them.
c50918	And Zephaniah the priest read this letter in the ears of Jeremiah the prophet.
c50919	Then came the word of the LORD unto Jeremiah,
c50920	saying,
c50921	Send to all them of the captivity,
c50922	saying,
c50923	Thus saith the LORD concerning Shemaiah the Nehelamite;
c50924	Because that Shemaiah hath prophesied
c50925	unto you, and I sent him not,
c50926	and he caused you to trust in a lie:
c50927	Therefore thus saith the LORD;
c50928	Behold, I will punish Shemaiah the Nehelamite, and his seed: he shall not have a man
c50930	to dwell among this people;
c50931	neither shall he behold the good
c50932	that I will do for my people,
c50933	saith the LORD;
c50934	because he hath taught rebellion against the LORD.
c50935	The word
c50936	that came to Jeremiah from the LORD,
c50937	saying,
c50938	Thus speaketh the LORD God of Israel,
c50939	saying,
c50940	Write thee all the words
c50941	that I have spoken unto
c50942	thee in a book.
c50943	For, lo, the days come,
c50944	saith the LORD,
c50945	that I will bring again the captivity of my people Israel and Judah,
c50946	saith the LORD:
c50947	and I will cause them to return to the land
c50948	that I gave to their fathers,
c50949	and they shall possess it.
c50950	And these <i>are</i> the words
c50951	that the LORD spake concerning Israel and concerning Judah.
c50952	For thus saith the LORD;
c50953	We have heard a voice of trembling,
c50954	of fear,
c50955	and not of peace.
c50956	Ask ye now,
c50957	and see
c50958	whether a man doth travail with child?
c50959	wherefore do I see every man
c50960	with his hands on his loins, as a woman in travail,
c50961	and all faces are turned into paleness?
c50962	Alas!
c50963	for that day <i>is</i> great,
c50964	so that none <i>is</i> like it:
c50965	it <i>is</i> even the time of Jacob's trouble;
c50966	but he shall be saved out of it.
c50967	For it shall come to pass in that day,
c50968	saith the LORD of hosts,
c50969	<i>that</i> I will break his yoke from off thy neck,
c50970	and will burst thy bonds,
c50971	and strangers shall no more serve themselves of him:
c50972	But they shall serve the LORD their God, and David their king,
c50973	whom I will raise up unto them.
c50975	Therefore fear thou not,
c50976	O my servant Jacob,
c50977	saith the LORD;
c50978	neither be dismayed,
c50979	O Israel:
c50980	for, lo, I will save thee from afar, and thy seed from the land of their captivity;
c50981	and Jacob shall return,
c50982	and shall be in rest,
c50983	and be quiet,
c50984	and none shall make <i>him</i> afraid.
c50985	For I <i>am</i> with
c50986	thee, saith the LORD,
c50987	to save
c50988	thee: though I make a full end of all nations
c50989	whither I have scattered
c50990	thee, yet will I not make a full end
c50991	of thee: but I will correct thee in measure,
c50992	and will not leave thee altogether unpunished.
c50993	For thus saith the LORD,
c50994	Thy bruise <i>is</i> incurable,
c50995	<i>and</i> thy wound <i>is</i> grievous.
c50996	<i>There is</i> none to plead thy cause,
c50997	that thou mayest be bound up: thou hast no healing medicines.
c50999	All thy lovers have forgotten
c51000	thee; they seek thee not;
c51001	for I have wounded thee with the wound of an enemy,
c51002	with the chastisement of a cruel
c51003	one, for the multitude of thine iniquity;
c51004	<i>because</i> thy sins were increased.
c51005	Why criest thou for thine affliction?
c51006	thy sorrow <i>is</i> incurable
c51007	for the multitude of thine iniquity:
c51008	<i>because</i> thy sins were increased,
c51009	I have done these things unto thee.
c51010	Therefore all they that devour thee shall be devoured;
c51011	and all thine adversaries,
c51012	every one of them, shall go into captivity;
c51013	and they that spoil thee shall be a spoil,
c51014	and all that prey upon thee will I give for a prey.
c51015	For I will restore health
c51016	unto thee, and I will heal thee of thy wounds,
c51017	saith the LORD;
c51018	because they called thee an Outcast,
c51019	<i>saying,</i> This <i>is</i> Zion,
c51020	whom no man seeketh after.
c51021	Thus saith the LORD;
c51022	Behold, I will bring again the captivity of Jacob's tents,
c51023	and have mercy on his dwellingplaces;
c51024	and the city shall be builded upon her own heap,
c51025	and the palace shall remain after the manner thereof.
c51026	And out of them shall proceed thanksgiving and the voice of them that make merry:
c51027	and I will multiply
c51028	them, and they shall not be few;
c51029	I will also glorify
c51030	them, and they shall not be small.
c51031	Their children also shall be as aforetime,
c51032	and their congregation shall be established before
c51033	me, and I will punish all that oppress them.
c51034	And their nobles shall be of
c51035	themselves, and their governor shall proceed from the midst
c51036	of them; and I will cause him to draw near,
c51037	and he shall approach unto
c51038	me: for who <i>is</i> this that
c51039	engaged his heart
c51040	to approach unto
c51041	me? saith the LORD.
c51042	And ye shall be my people,
c51043	and I will be your God.
c51044	Behold, the whirlwind of the LORD
c51045	goeth forth with fury,
c51046	a continuing whirlwind:
c51047	it shall fall with pain upon the head of the wicked.
c51048	The fierce anger of the LORD shall not return,
c51049	until he have done
c51050	<i>it,</i> and until he have performed the intents of his heart:
c51051	in the latter days ye shall consider it.
c51052	At the same time,
c51053	saith the LORD,
c51054	will I be the God of all the families of Israel,
c51055	and they shall be my people.
c51056	Thus saith the LORD,
c51057	The people <i>which were</i> left of the sword found grace in the wilderness;
c51058	when I went
c51059	to cause him to rest.
c51060	<i>even</i> Israel,
c51061	The LORD hath appeared of old
c51062	unto me, <i>saying,</i> Yea, I have loved thee with an everlasting love:
c51063	therefore with lovingkindness have I drawn thee.
c51064	Again I will build
c51065	thee, and thou shalt be built,
c51066	O virgin of Israel:
c51067	thou shalt again be adorned with thy tabrets,
c51068	and shalt go forth in the dances of them that make merry.
c51069	Thou shalt yet plant vines upon the mountains of Samaria:
c51070	the planters shall plant,
c51071	and shall eat <i>them</i> as common things.
c51072	For there shall be a day,
c51073	<i>that</i> the watchmen upon the mount Ephraim shall cry,
c51074	Arise
c51075	ye, and let us go up to Zion unto the LORD our God.
c51076	For thus saith the LORD;
c51077	Sing with gladness for Jacob,
c51078	and shout among the chief of the nations:
c51079	publish
c51080	ye, praise
c51081	ye, and say,
c51082	save
c51083	O LORD,
c51084	thy people, the remnant of Israel.
c51085	Behold, I will bring them from the north country,
c51086	and gather them from the coasts of the earth,
c51087	<i>and</i> with them the blind and the lame, the woman with child and her that travaileth with child together:
c51088	a great company shall return thither.
c51089	They shall come with weeping,
c51090	and with supplications will I lead
c51091	them: I will cause them to walk by the rivers of waters in a straight way,
c51092	wherein they shall not stumble:
c51093	for I am a father to Israel,
c51094	and Ephraim
c51095	<i>is</i> my firstborn.
c51096	Hear the word of the LORD,
c51097	O ye nations,
c51098	and declare <i>it</i> in the isles afar off,
c51099	and say,
c51100	He that scattered Israel will gather
c51101	him, and keep him, as a shepherd <i>doth</i> his flock.
c51102	For the LORD hath redeemed Jacob,
c51103	and ransomed him from the hand of <i>him that was</i> stronger than he.
c51104	Therefore they shall come
c51105	and sing in the height of Zion,
c51106	and shall flow together to the goodness of the LORD, for wheat, and for wine, and for oil, and for the young of the flock and of the herd:
c51107	and their soul shall be as a watered garden;
c51108	and they shall not sorrow any more at all.
c51110	Then shall the virgin rejoice in the dance,
c51111	both young men and old together:
c51112	for I will turn their mourning into joy,
c51113	and will comfort
c51114	them, and make them rejoice from their sorrow.
c51115	And I will satiate the soul of the priests with fatness,
c51116	and my people shall be satisfied with my goodness,
c51117	saith the LORD.
c51118	Thus saith the LORD;
c51119	A voice was heard in Ramah,
c51120	lamentation, <i>and</i> bitter weeping;
c51121	Rahel
c51122	weeping for her children
c51123	refused
c51124	to be comforted for her children,
c51125	because they <i>were</i> not.
c51126	Thus saith the LORD;
c51127	Refrain thy voice from weeping,
c51128	and thine eyes from tears:
c51129	for thy work shall be rewarded,
c51130	saith the LORD;
c51131	and they shall come again from the land of the enemy.
c51132	And there is hope in thine end,
c51133	saith the LORD,
c51134	that thy children shall come again to their own border.
c51135	I have surely heard Ephraim
c51136	bemoaning himself
c51137	<i>thus;</i> Thou hast chastised
c51138	me, and I was chastised, as a bullock
c51139	unaccustomed
c51140	<i>to the yoke:</i> turn
c51141	thou me, and I shall be turned;
c51142	for thou <i>art</i> the LORD my God.
c51143	Surely
c51144	after that I was turned,
c51145	I repented;
c51147	and after that I was instructed,
c51148	I smote upon <i>my</i> thigh:
c51149	I was ashamed,
c51150	yea, even confounded,
c51151	because I did bear the reproach of my youth.
c51152	<i>Is</i> Ephraim my dear son?
c51153	<i>is he</i> a pleasant child?
c51154	for
c51155	since I spake
c51156	against him, I do earnestly remember him still:
c51157	therefore my bowels are troubled
c51158	for him; I will surely have mercy
c51159	upon him, saith the LORD.
c51160	Set thee up waymarks,
c51161	make thee high heaps:
c51162	set thine heart toward the highway,
c51163	<i>even</i> the way
c51164	<i>which</i> thou wentest:
c51165	turn again,
c51166	O virgin of Israel,
c51167	turn again to these thy cities.
c51168	How long wilt thou go about,
c51169	O thou backsliding daughter?
c51170	for the LORD hath created a new thing in the earth,
c51171	A woman shall compass a man.
c51172	Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel;
c51173	As yet they shall use this speech in the land of Judah and in the cities
c51174	thereof, when I shall bring again their captivity;
c51175	The LORD bless
c51176	thee, O habitation of justice, <i>and</i> mountain of holiness.
c51177	And there shall dwell in Judah itself, and in all the cities thereof together,
c51178	husbandmen,
c51179	and they <i>that</i> go forth with flocks.
c51180	For I have satiated the weary soul,
c51181	every sorrowful soul.
c51183	and I have replenished
c51184	Upon this I awaked,
c51185	and beheld;
c51186	and my sleep was sweet unto me.
c51187	Behold, the days come,
c51188	saith the LORD,
c51189	that I will sow the house of Israel and the house of Judah with the seed of man, and with the seed of beast.
c51190	And it shall come to pass,
c51191	<i>that</i> like as I have watched over
c51192	them, to pluck up,
c51193	and to break down,
c51194	and to throw down,
c51195	and to destroy,
c51196	and to afflict;
c51197	so will I watch over
c51198	them, to build,
c51199	and to plant,
c51200	saith the LORD.
c51201	In those days they shall say no more,
c51202	The fathers have eaten a sour grape,
c51203	and the children's teeth are set on edge.
c51204	But every one shall die for his own iniquity:
c51205	every man
c51206	that eateth the sour grape,
c51207	his teeth shall be set on edge.
c51208	Behold, the days come,
c51209	saith the LORD,
c51210	that I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel, and with the house of Judah:
c51211	Not according to the covenant
c51212	that I made with their fathers in the day
c51213	<i>that</i> I took them by the hand
c51214	to bring them out of the land of Egypt;
c51215	which my covenant they brake,
c51216	although I was an husband
c51217	unto them, saith the LORD:
c51218	But this <i>shall be</i> the covenant
c51219	that I will make with the house of Israel; After those days,
c51220	saith the LORD,
c51221	I will put my law in their inward parts,
c51222	and write it in their hearts;
c51223	and will be their God,
c51224	and they shall be my people.
c51225	And they shall teach no more
c51226	every man his neighbour,
c51227	and every man his brother,
c51228	saying,
c51229	Know the LORD:
c51230	for they shall all know me, from the least of them unto the greatest
c51231	of them, saith the LORD:
c51232	for I will forgive their iniquity,
c51233	and I will remember their sin no more.
c51234	Thus saith the LORD,
c51235	which giveth the sun for a light by day,
c51236	<i>and</i> the ordinances of the moon and of the stars for a light by night,
c51237	which divideth the sea
c51238	when the waves thereof roar;
c51239	The LORD of hosts <i>is</i> his name:
c51240	If those ordinances depart from before
c51241	me, saith the LORD,
c51242	<i>then</i> the seed of Israel also shall cease
c51243	from being a nation before me for ever.
c51244	Thus saith the LORD;
c51245	If heaven above can be measured,
c51246	and the foundations of the earth searched out beneath,
c51247	I will also cast off all the seed of Israel for all
c51248	that they have done,
c51249	saith the LORD.
c51250	Behold, the days come,
c51251	saith the LORD,
c51252	that the city shall be built to the LORD from the tower of Hananeel unto the gate of the corner.
c51253	And the measuring line shall yet go forth over against it upon the hill Gareb,
c51254	and shall compass about to Goath.
c51255	And the whole valley of the dead bodies, and of the ashes, and all the fields unto the brook of Kidron, unto the corner of the horse gate toward the east, <i>shall be</i> holy unto the LORD;
c51256	it shall not be plucked up,
c51257	nor thrown down any more for ever.
c51258	The word
c51259	that came to Jeremiah from the LORD in the tenth year of Zedekiah king of Judah,
c51260	which <i>was</i> the eighteenth year of Nebuchadrezzar.
c51261	For then the king of Babylon's army besieged Jerusalem:
c51262	and Jeremiah the prophet was shut up in the court of the prison,
c51263	which <i>was</i> in the king of Judah's house.
c51264	For Zedekiah king of Judah had shut him up,
c51265	saying,
c51266	Wherefore dost thou prophesy,
c51267	and say,
c51268	Thus saith the LORD,
c51269	Behold, I will give this city into the hand of the king of Babylon,
c51270	and he shall take it;
c51271	And Zedekiah king of Judah shall not escape out of the hand of the Chaldeans,
c51272	but shall surely be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon,
c51273	and shall speak with him mouth to mouth,
c51274	and his eyes shall behold his eyes;
c51275	And he shall lead Zedekiah to Babylon,
c51276	and there shall he be
c51277	until I visit
c51278	him, saith the LORD:
c51279	though ye fight with the Chaldeans,
c51280	ye shall not prosper.
c51281	And Jeremiah said,
c51282	The word of the LORD came unto
c51283	me, saying,
c51284	Behold, Hanameel the son of Shallum thine uncle shall come unto
c51285	thee, saying,
c51286	Buy thee my field
c51287	that <i>is</i> in Anathoth:
c51288	for the right of redemption
c51289	<i>is</i> thine to buy <i>it.</i>
c51290	So Hanameel mine uncle's son came to me in the court of the prison according to the word of the LORD,
c51291	and said unto
c51292	me, Buy my field, I pray thee,
c51293	that <i>is</i> in Anathoth,
c51294	which <i>is</i> in the country of Benjamin:
c51295	for the right of inheritance
c51296	<i>is</i> thine, and the redemption
c51297	<i>is</i> thine; buy
c51298	<i>it</i> for thyself. Then I knew
c51299	that this <i>was</i> the word of the LORD.
c51300	And I bought the field of Hanameel my uncle's son, that <i>was</i> in Anathoth,
c51302	and weighed him the money,
c51303	<i>even</i> seventeen shekels of silver.
c51304	And I subscribed the evidence,
c51305	and sealed
c51306	<i>it,</i> and took witnesses,
c51307	and weighed <i>him</i> the money in the balances.
c51308	So I took the evidence of the purchase, <i>both</i> that which was sealed <i>according</i> to the law and custom, and that which was open:
c51309	And I gave the evidence of the purchase unto Baruch the son of Neriah, the son of Maaseiah, in the sight of Hanameel mine uncle's <i>son,</i> and in the presence of the witnesses
c51310	that subscribed the book of the purchase,
c51311	before all the Jews
c51312	that sat in the court of the prison.
c51313	And I charged Baruch before
c51314	them, saying,
c51315	Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel;
c51316	Take these evidences, this evidence of the purchase, both which is sealed, and this evidence which is open;
c51317	and put them in an earthen vessel,
c51318	that they may continue many days.
c51319	For thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel;
c51320	Houses and fields and vineyards shall be possessed again in this land.
c51321	the LORD,
c51322	Now when I had delivered the evidence of the purchase unto Baruch the son of Neriah, I prayed unto
c51323	saying,
c51324	Ah Lord GOD!
c51325	behold, thou hast made the heaven and the earth by thy great power and stretched out arm,
c51326	<i>and</i> there is nothing too hard for thee:
c51327	Thou shewest lovingkindness unto thousands,
c51328	and recompensest the iniquity of the fathers into the bosom of their children after
c51329	them: the Great, the Mighty God,
c51331	the LORD of hosts, <i>is</i> his name,
c51332	Great in counsel,
c51333	and mighty in work:
c51334	for thine eyes <i>are</i> open upon all the ways of the sons of men:
c51335	to give every one according to his ways, and according to the fruit of his doings:
c51336	Which hast set signs and wonders in the land of Egypt, <i>even</i> unto this day, and in Israel, and among <i>other</i> men;
c51337	and hast made thee a name, as at this day;
c51338	And hast brought forth thy people Israel out of the land of Egypt with signs, and with wonders, and with a strong hand, and with a stretched out arm, and with great terror;
c51339	And hast given them this land,
c51340	which thou didst swear to their fathers
c51341	to give
c51342	them, a land flowing with milk and honey;
c51343	And they came
c51344	in, and possessed
c51345	it; but they obeyed not thy voice,
c51346	neither walked in thy law;
c51348	that thou commandedst them to do:
c51349	they have done
c51350	nothing of all
c51351	therefore thou hast caused all this evil to come upon them:
c51352	Behold the mounts, they are come unto the city
c51353	to take
c51354	it; and the city is given into the hand of the Chaldeans,
c51355	that fight against
c51356	it, because of the sword, and of the famine, and of the pestilence:
c51358	and what thou hast spoken
c51359	is come to pass;
c51360	and, behold, thou seest <i>it.</i>
c51361	And thou hast said unto
c51362	me, O Lord GOD,
c51363	Buy thee the field for money,
c51364	and take witnesses;
c51365	for the city is given into the hand of the Chaldeans.
c51366	Then came the word of the LORD unto Jeremiah,
c51367	saying,
c51368	Behold, I <i>am</i> the LORD, the God of all flesh:
c51369	is there any thing too hard for me?
c51370	Therefore thus saith the LORD;
c51371	Behold, I will give this city into the hand of the Chaldeans, and into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon,
c51372	and he shall take it:
c51373	And the Chaldeans, that fight against this city, shall come
c51375	and set fire on this city,
c51376	and burn
c51377	it with the houses,
c51378	upon whose roofs they have offered incense unto Baal,
c51379	and poured out drink offerings unto other gods,
c51380	to provoke me to anger.
c51381	For the children of Israel and the children of Judah have only done
c51382	evil before
c51383	me from their youth:
c51384	for the children of Israel have only provoked me to anger with the work of their hands,
c51385	saith the LORD.
c51386	For this city hath been to me <i>as</i> a provocation of mine anger and of my fury from the day
c51387	that they built
c51388	it even unto this day;
c51389	that I should remove it from before my face,
c51390	Because of all the evil of the children of Israel and of the children of Judah,
c51391	which they have done
c51392	to provoke me to anger,
c51393	they, their kings, their princes, their priests, and their prophets, and the men of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
c51394	And they have turned unto me the back,
c51395	and not the face:
c51396	though I taught
c51397	them, rising up early
c51398	and teaching
c51399	<i>them,</i> yet they have not hearkened
c51400	to receive instruction.
c51401	But they set their abominations in the house,
c51402	which is called by my name,
c51403	to defile it.
c51404	And they built the high places of Baal,
c51405	which <i>are</i> in the valley of the son of Hinnom,
c51406	to cause their sons and their daughters to pass through <i>the fire</i> unto Molech;
c51407	which I commanded them not,
c51408	neither came it into my mind,
c51409	that they should do this abomination,
c51410	to cause Judah to sin.
c51411	And now
c51412	therefore thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel, concerning this city,
c51413	whereof ye say,
c51414	It shall be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon by the sword, and by the famine, and by the pestilence;
c51415	Behold, I will gather them out of all countries,
c51416	whither I have driven them in mine anger, and in my fury, and in great wrath;
c51417	and I will bring them again unto this place,
c51418	and I will cause them to dwell safely:
c51419	And they shall be my people,
c51420	and I will be their God:
c51421	And I will give them one heart, and one way,
c51422	that they may fear me for ever,
c51423	for the good of them, and of their children after them:
c51424	And I will make an everlasting covenant
c51425	with them, that I will not turn away from
c51426	them, to do them good;
c51427	but I will put my fear in their hearts,
c51428	that they shall not depart from me.
c51429	Yea, I will rejoice over
c51430	them to do them good,
c51431	and I will plant them in this land assuredly with my whole heart and with my whole soul.
c51432	For thus saith the LORD;
c51433	Like as I have brought all this great evil upon this people,
c51434	so will I bring upon them all the good
c51435	that I have promised them.
c51436	And fields shall be bought in this land,
c51437	whereof ye say,
c51438	It <i>is</i> desolate without man or beast;
c51439	it is given into the hand of the Chaldeans.
c51440	Men shall buy fields for money,
c51441	and subscribe evidences,
c51442	and seal
c51443	<i>them,</i> and take witnesses
c51444	in the land of Benjamin, and in the places about Jerusalem, and in the cities of Judah, and in the cities of the mountains, and in the cities of the valley, and in the cities of the south:
c51445	for I will cause their captivity to return,
c51446	saith the LORD.
c51447	Moreover the word of the LORD came unto Jeremiah the second
c51448	time, while he
c51449	was yet shut up in the court of the prison,
c51450	saying,
c51451	Thus saith the LORD
c51452	the maker
c51453	thereof, the LORD
c51454	that formed
c51455	it, to establish
c51456	it; the LORD <i>is</i> his name;
c51457	Call unto
c51458	me, and I will answer
c51459	thee, and shew thee great and mighty
c51460	things, which thou knowest not.
c51461	For thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel, concerning the houses of this city, and concerning the houses of the kings of Judah,
c51462	which are thrown down by the mounts, and by the sword;
c51463	They come
c51464	to fight with the Chaldeans,
c51465	but <i>it is</i> to fill them with the dead bodies of men,
c51466	whom I have slain in mine anger and in my fury,
c51467	and for all whose wickedness I have hid my face from this city.
c51468	Behold, I will bring it health and cure,
c51469	and I will cure
c51470	them, and will reveal unto them the abundance of peace and truth.
c51471	And I will cause the captivity of Judah and the captivity of Israel to return,
c51472	and will build them, as at the first.
c51473	And I will cleanse them from all their iniquity,
c51474	whereby they have sinned
c51475	against me; and I will pardon all their iniquities,
c51476	whereby they have sinned,
c51477	and whereby they have transgressed against me.
c51478	And it shall be to me a name of joy, a praise and an honour before all the nations of the earth,
c51479	which shall hear all the good
c51480	that I do unto
c51481	them: and they shall fear
c51482	and tremble for all the goodness and for all the prosperity
c51483	that I procure unto it.
c51484	Thus saith the LORD;
c51485	Again there shall be heard in this place,
c51486	which ye say
c51487	<i>shall be</i> desolate without man and without beast,
c51488	<i>even</i> in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem,
c51489	that are desolate, without man, and without inhabitant, and without beast,
c51490	The voice of joy, and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the bride,
c51491	the voice of them that shall say,
c51492	Praise the LORD of hosts:
c51493	for the LORD <i>is</i> good;
c51494	for his mercy <i>endureth</i> for ever:
c51495	<i>and</i> of them that shall bring the sacrifice of praise into the house of the LORD.
c51496	For I will cause to return the captivity of the land, as at the first,
c51497	saith the LORD.
c51498	Thus saith the LORD of hosts;
c51499	Again in this place, which is desolate without man and without beast,
c51501	and in all the cities thereof, shall be an habitation of shepherds
c51502	causing <i>their</i> flocks to lie down.
c51503	In the cities of the mountains, in the cities of the vale, and in the cities of the south, and in the land of Benjamin, and in the places about Jerusalem, and in the cities of Judah, shall the flocks pass again under the hands of him that telleth
c51504	<i>them,</i> saith the LORD.
c51505	Behold, the days come,
c51506	saith the LORD,
c51507	that I will perform that good thing
c51508	which I have promised unto the house of Israel and to the house of Judah.
c51509	In those days, and at that time, will I cause the Branch of righteousness to grow up unto David;
c51510	and he shall execute judgment and righteousness in the land.
c51511	In those days shall Judah be saved,
c51512	and Jerusalem shall dwell safely:
c51513	and this
c51514	<i>is the name</i> wherewith she shall be called,
c51515	The LORD our righteousness.
c51516	For thus saith the LORD;
c51517	David shall never want a man
c51518	to sit upon the throne of the house of Israel;
c51519	Neither shall the priests the Levites want a man before
c51520	me to offer burnt offerings,
c51521	and to kindle meat offerings,
c51522	and to do sacrifice
c51523	continually.
c51524	And the word of the LORD came unto Jeremiah,
c51525	saying,
c51526	Thus saith the LORD;
c51527	If ye can break my covenant of the day, and my covenant of the night,
c51528	and that there should not be day and night in their season;
c51529	<i>Then</i> may also my covenant be broken with David my servant,
c51530	that he should not have a son
c51531	to reign upon his throne;
c51532	and with the Levites the priests, my ministers.
c51533	As the host of heaven cannot be numbered,
c51534	neither the sand of the sea measured:
c51535	so will I multiply the seed of David my servant, and the Levites
c51536	that minister unto me.
c51537	Moreover the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah,
c51538	saying,
c51539	Considerest thou not
c51540	what this people have spoken,
c51541	saying,
c51542	The two families
c51543	which the LORD hath chosen,
c51544	he hath even cast them off?
c51545	thus they have despised my people,
c51546	that they should be no more a nation before them.
c51547	Thus saith the LORD;
c51548	If my covenant <i>be</i> not with day and night,
c51549	<i>and if</i> I have not appointed the ordinances of heaven and earth;
c51550	Then will I cast away the seed of Jacob, and David my servant,
c51551	<i>so</i> that I will not take <i>any</i> of his seed <i>to be</i> rulers over the seed of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob:
c51552	for I will cause their captivity to return,
c51553	and have mercy on them.
c51554	The word
c51555	which came unto Jeremiah from the LORD,
c51556	when Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and all his army, and all the kingdoms of the earth of his dominion, and all the people, fought against Jerusalem, and against all the cities
c51557	thereof, saying,
c51558	Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel;
c51559	Go
c51560	and speak to Zedekiah king of Judah,
c51561	and tell
c51562	him, Thus saith the LORD;
c51563	Behold, I will give this city into the hand of the king of Babylon,
c51564	and he shall burn it with fire:
c51565	And thou shalt not escape out of his hand,
c51566	but shalt surely be taken,
c51567	and delivered into his hand;
c51568	and thine eyes shall behold the eyes of the king of Babylon,
c51569	and he shall speak with thee mouth to mouth,
c51570	and thou shalt go to Babylon.
c51571	Yet hear the word of the LORD,
c51572	O Zedekiah king of Judah;
c51573	Thus saith the LORD of
c51574	thee, Thou shalt not die by the sword:
c51575	<i>But</i> thou shalt die in peace:
c51576	and with the burnings of thy fathers, the former kings
c51577	which were before
c51578	thee, so shall they burn
c51580	thee, <i>saying,</i> Ah lord!
c51581	<i>odours</i> for thee; and they will lament
c51582	for I have pronounced the word,
c51583	saith the LORD.
c51584	Then Jeremiah the prophet spake all these words unto Zedekiah king of Judah in Jerusalem,
c51585	When the king of Babylon's army fought against Jerusalem, and against all the cities of Judah that were left, against Lachish, and against Azekah:
c51586	for these defenced cities remained of the cities of Judah.
c51587	<i>This is</i> the word
c51588	that came unto Jeremiah from the LORD, after that the king Zedekiah had made a covenant with
c51589	all the people
c51590	which <i>were</i> at Jerusalem,
c51591	to proclaim liberty unto them;
c51593	That every man should let his manservant,
c51594	and every man his maidservant,
c51595	<i>being</i> an Hebrew or an Hebrewess, go free;
c51596	that none should serve himself of them, <i>to wit,</i> of a Jew his brother.
c51597	Now when all the princes, and all the people, which had entered into the covenant, heard
c51599	go
c51600	that every one should let his manservant,
c51601	and every one his maidservant,
c51602	free,
c51603	that none should serve themselves of them any more,
c51604	then they obeyed,
c51605	and let <i>them</i> go.
c51606	But afterward they turned,
c51607	and caused the servants and the handmaids, whom they had let go free, to return,
c51609	and brought them into subjection for servants and for handmaids.
c51610	Therefore the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah from the LORD,
c51611	saying,
c51612	Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel;
c51613	I made a covenant with your fathers in the day
c51614	that I brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondmen,
c51615	saying,
c51616	At the end of seven years let ye go
c51617	every man his brother
c51618	an Hebrew,
c51619	which hath been sold
c51620	unto thee; and when he hath served thee six years,
c51621	thou shalt let him go free from
c51622	thee: but your fathers hearkened not unto
c51623	me, neither inclined their ear.
c51624	And ye were now turned,
c51625	and had done right in my sight,
c51626	in proclaiming liberty
c51627	every man to his neighbour;
c51628	and ye had made a covenant before me in the house
c51629	which is called by my name:
c51630	But ye turned
c51631	and polluted my name,
c51632	to return,
c51633	and caused every man his servant,
c51634	and every man his handmaid,
c51635	whom ye had set at liberty at their pleasure,
c51636	and brought them into subjection,
c51637	to be unto you for servants and for handmaids.
c51638	Therefore thus saith the LORD;
c51639	Ye have not hearkened unto
c51640	me, in proclaiming liberty,
c51641	every one to his brother,
c51642	and every man to his neighbour:
c51643	behold, I proclaim a liberty
c51644	for you, saith the LORD,
c51645	to the sword, to the pestilence, and to the famine;
c51646	and I will make you to be removed into all the kingdoms of the earth.
c51647	And I will give the men
c51648	that have transgressed my covenant,
c51649	which have not performed the words of the covenant
c51650	which they had made before
c51652	me, when they cut the calf in twain,
c51653	and passed between the parts thereof,
c51654	The princes of Judah, and the princes of Jerusalem, the eunuchs, and the priests, and all the people of the land,
c51655	which passed between the parts of the calf;
c51656	I will even give them into the hand of their enemies, and into the hand of them that seek their life:
c51657	and their dead bodies shall be for meat unto the fowls of the heaven, and to the beasts of the earth.
c51658	And Zedekiah king of Judah and his princes will I give into the hand of their enemies, and into the hand of them that seek their life, and into the hand of the king of Babylon's army,
c51659	which are gone up from you.
c51660	Behold, I will command,
c51661	saith the LORD,
c51662	and cause them to return to this city;
c51663	and they shall fight against
c51664	it, and take
c51665	it, and burn it with fire:
c51666	and I will make the cities of Judah a desolation without an inhabitant.
c51667	The word
c51668	which came unto Jeremiah from the LORD in the days of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah,
c51669	saying,
c51670	Go unto the house of the Rechabites,
c51671	and speak unto
c51672	them, and bring them into the house of the LORD, into one of the chambers,
c51673	and give them wine to drink.
c51674	Then I took Jaazaniah the son of Jeremiah, the son of Habaziniah, and his brethren, and all his sons, and the whole house of the Rechabites;
c51675	And I brought them into the house of the LORD, into the chamber of the sons of Hanan, the son of Igdaliah, a man of God,
c51676	which <i>was</i> by the chamber of the princes,
c51677	which <i>was</i> above the chamber of Maaseiah the son of Shallum, the keeper of the door:
c51678	And I set before the sons of the house of the Rechabites pots
c51679	full of wine,
c51680	and cups,
c51681	and I said unto
c51682	them, Drink ye wine.
c51683	But they said,
c51684	We will drink no wine:
c51685	for Jonadab the son of Rechab our father commanded
c51686	us, saying,
c51687	Ye shall drink no wine, <i>neither</i> ye, nor your sons for ever:
c51688	Neither shall ye build house,
c51689	nor sow seed,
c51690	nor plant vineyard,
c51691	nor have
c51692	<i>any:</i> but all your days ye shall dwell in tents;
c51693	that ye may live many days in the land
c51694	where ye <i>be</i> strangers.
c51695	Thus have we obeyed the voice of Jonadab the son of Rechab our father in all
c51696	that he hath charged
c51697	us, to drink no wine all our days, we, our wives, our sons, nor our daughters;
c51698	Nor to build houses
c51699	for us to dwell
c51700	in: neither have we vineyard, nor field, nor seed:
c51701	But we have dwelt in tents,
c51702	and have obeyed,
c51703	and done according to all
c51704	that Jonadab our father commanded us.
c51705	But it came to pass,
c51706	when Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon came up into the land,
c51707	that we said,
c51708	Come,
c51709	and let us go to Jerusalem for fear of the army of the Chaldeans, and for fear of the army of the Syrians:
c51710	so we dwell at Jerusalem.
c51711	Then came the word of the LORD unto Jeremiah,
c51712	saying,
c51713	Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel;
c51714	Go
c51715	and tell the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem,
c51716	Will ye not receive instruction
c51717	to hearken to my words?
c51718	saith the LORD.
c51719	The words of Jonadab the son of Rechab, that he commanded his sons
c51721	not to drink wine, are performed;
c51722	for unto this day they drink none,
c51723	but obey their father's commandment:
c51724	notwithstanding I have spoken unto you, rising early and speaking;
c51725	but ye hearkened not unto me.
c51726	I have sent also unto you all my servants the prophets, rising up early and sending
c51727	<i>them,</i> saying,
c51728	Return ye now every man from his evil way,
c51729	and amend your doings,
c51730	and go not after other gods
c51731	to serve
c51732	them, and ye shall dwell in the land
c51733	which I have given to you and to your fathers:
c51734	but ye have not inclined your ear,
c51735	nor hearkened unto me.
c51736	Because the sons of Jonadab the son of Rechab have performed the commandment of their father,
c51737	which he commanded
c51738	them; but this people hath not hearkened unto me:
c51739	Therefore thus saith the LORD God of hosts, the God of Israel;
c51740	Behold, I will bring upon Judah and upon all the inhabitants of Jerusalem all the evil
c51741	that I have pronounced against
c51742	them: because I have spoken unto
c51743	them, but they have not heard;
c51744	and I have called
c51745	unto them, but they have not answered.
c51746	And Jeremiah said unto the house of the Rechabites,
c51747	Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel;
c51748	Because ye have obeyed the commandment of Jonadab your father,
c51749	and kept all his precepts,
c51750	and done according unto all
c51751	that he hath commanded you:
c51752	Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel;
c51753	Jonadab the son of Rechab shall not want a man
c51754	to stand before
c51755	me for ever.
c51756	And it came to pass in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah,
c51757	<i>that</i> this word came unto Jeremiah from the LORD,
c51758	saying,
c51759	Take thee a roll of a book,
c51760	and write therein all the words
c51761	that I have spoken unto thee against Israel, and against Judah, and against all the nations, from the day
c51762	I spake unto
c51763	thee, from the days of Josiah, even unto this day.
c51764	It may be that the house of Judah will hear all the evil
c51765	which I purpose
c51766	to do
c51767	unto them; that they may return every man from his evil way;
c51768	that I may forgive their iniquity and their sin.
c51769	Then Jeremiah called Baruch the son of Neriah:
c51770	and Baruch wrote from the mouth of Jeremiah all the words of the LORD,
c51771	which he had spoken unto
c51772	him, upon a roll of a book.
c51773	And Jeremiah commanded Baruch,
c51774	saying,
c51775	I <i>am</i> shut up;
c51776	I cannot
c51777	go into the house of the LORD:
c51778	Therefore go thou,
c51779	and read in the roll,
c51780	which thou hast written from my mouth,
c51781	the words of the LORD in the ears of the people in the LORD'S house upon the fasting day:
c51782	and also thou shalt read them in the ears of all Judah
c51783	that come out of their cities.
c51785	It may be they will present their supplication before the LORD,
c51786	and will return every one from his evil way:
c51787	for great <i>is</i> the anger and the fury
c51788	that the LORD hath pronounced against this people.
c51789	And Baruch the son of Neriah did according to all
c51790	that Jeremiah the prophet commanded
c51791	him, reading in the book the words of the LORD in the LORD'S house.
c51792	And it came to pass in the fifth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, in the ninth month,
c51793	<i>that</i> they proclaimed a fast before the LORD to all the people in Jerusalem, and to all the people
c51794	that came from the cities of Judah unto Jerusalem.
c51795	Then read Baruch in the book the words of Jeremiah in the house of the LORD, in the chamber of Gemariah the son of Shaphan the scribe, in the higher court, at the entry of the new gate of the LORD'S house, in the ears of all the people.
c51796	When Michaiah the son of Gemariah, the son of Shaphan, had heard out of the book all the words of the LORD,
c51797	Then he went down into the king's house, into the scribe's chamber:
c51798	and, lo, all the princes sat there,
c51799	<i>even</i> Elishama the scribe, and Delaiah the son of Shemaiah, and Elnathan the son of Achbor, and Gemariah the son of Shaphan, and Zedekiah the son of Hananiah, and all the princes.
c51800	Then Michaiah declared unto them all the words
c51801	that he had heard,
c51802	when Baruch read the book in the ears of the people.
c51803	Therefore all the princes sent Jehudi the son of Nethaniah, the son of Shelemiah, the son of Cushi, unto Baruch,
c51804	saying,
c51805	the roll
c51806	wherein thou hast read in the ears of the people,
c51807	Take in thine hand
c51808	and come.
c51809	So Baruch the son of Neriah took the roll in his hand,
c51810	and came unto them.
c51811	And they said unto
c51812	him, Sit down now,
c51813	and read it in our ears.
c51814	So Baruch read <i>it</i> in their ears.
c51815	Now it came to pass,
c51816	when they had heard all the words,
c51817	they were afraid
c51818	both one and other,
c51819	and said unto Baruch,
c51820	We will surely tell the king of all these words.
c51821	And they asked Baruch,
c51822	saying,
c51823	Tell us now,
c51824	How didst thou write all these words at his mouth?
c51825	Then Baruch answered
c51826	them, He pronounced all these words unto me with his mouth,
c51827	and I wrote <i>them</i> with ink in the book.
c51828	Then said the princes unto Baruch,
c51829	Go,
c51830	hide thee, thou and Jeremiah;
c51831	and let no man know
c51832	where ye be.
c51833	And they went in to the king into the court,
c51834	but they laid up the roll in the chamber of Elishama the scribe,
c51835	and told all the words in the ears of the king.
c51836	So the king sent Jehudi
c51837	to fetch the roll:
c51838	and he took it out of Elishama the scribe's chamber.
c51839	And Jehudi read it in the ears of the king, and in the ears of all the princes
c51840	which stood beside the king.
c51841	Now the king sat in the winterhouse in the ninth month:
c51842	and <i>there was a fire</i> on the hearth burning before him.
c51843	And it came to pass,
c51844	<i>that</i> when Jehudi had read three or four leaves,
c51845	he cut it with the penknife,
c51846	and cast <i>it</i> into the fire
c51847	that <i>was</i> on the hearth,
c51848	until all the roll was consumed in the fire
c51849	that <i>was</i> on the hearth.
c51850	Yet they were not afraid,
c51851	nor rent their garments, <i>neither</i> the king, nor any of his servants
c51852	that heard all these words.
c51853	Nevertheless Elnathan and Delaiah and Gemariah had made intercession to the king
c51854	that he would not burn the roll:
c51855	but he would not hear them.
c51856	But the king commanded Jerahmeel the son of Hammelech, and Seraiah the son of Azriel, and Shelemiah the son of Abdeel,
c51857	to take Baruch the scribe and Jeremiah the prophet:
c51858	but the LORD hid them.
c51859	Then the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah,
c51860	after that the king had burned the roll, and the words
c51861	which Baruch wrote at the mouth of Jeremiah,
c51862	saying,
c51864	Take thee again another roll,
c51865	and write in it all the former words
c51866	that were in the first roll,
c51867	which Jehoiakim the king of Judah hath burned.
c51868	And thou shalt say to Jehoiakim king of Judah,
c51869	Thus saith the LORD;
c51870	Thou hast burned this roll,
c51871	saying,
c51872	Why hast thou written therein,
c51873	saying,
c51874	The king of Babylon shall certainly come
c51875	and destroy this land,
c51876	and shall cause to cease from thence man and beast?
c51877	Therefore thus saith the LORD of Jehoiakim king of Judah;
c51878	He shall have none
c51879	to sit upon the throne of David:
c51880	and his dead body shall be cast out in the day to the heat, and in the night to the frost.
c51881	And I will punish him and his seed and his servants for their iniquity; and I will bring upon them, and upon
c51882	the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and upon the men of Judah, all the evil
c51883	that I have pronounced against
c51884	them; but they hearkened not.
c51885	Then took Jeremiah another roll,
c51886	and gave it to Baruch the scribe, the son of Neriah;
c51887	who wrote therein from the mouth of Jeremiah all the words of the book
c51888	which Jehoiakim king of Judah had burned in the fire:
c51889	and there were added besides unto them many like words.
c51890	And king Zedekiah the son of Josiah reigned instead of Coniah the son of Jehoiakim,
c51891	whom Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon made king in the land of Judah.
c51892	But neither he, nor his servants, nor the people of the land, did hearken unto the words of the LORD,
c51893	which he spake by the prophet Jeremiah.
c51894	And Zedekiah the king sent Jehucal the son of Shelemiah and Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah the priest to the prophet Jeremiah,
c51895	saying,
c51896	Pray now unto the LORD our God for us.
c51897	Now Jeremiah came in
c51898	and went out among the people:
c51899	for they had not put him into prison.
c51900	Then Pharaoh's army was come forth out of Egypt:
c51901	and when the Chaldeans that besieged Jerusalem heard
c51903	tidings
c51904	of them, they departed from Jerusalem.
c51905	Then came the word of the LORD unto the prophet Jeremiah,
c51906	saying,
c51907	Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel;
c51908	Thus shall ye say to the king of Judah,
c51909	that sent you unto
c51910	me to enquire
c51911	of me; Behold, Pharaoh's army,
c51912	which is come forth to help
c51913	you, shall return to Egypt into their own land.
c51914	And the Chaldeans shall come again,
c51915	and fight against this city,
c51916	and take
c51917	it, and burn it with fire.
c51918	Thus saith the LORD;
c51919	Deceive not yourselves,
c51920	saying,
c51921	The Chaldeans shall surely depart from
c51922	us: for they shall not depart.
c51923	For
c51924	though ye had smitten the whole army of the Chaldeans
c51925	that fight against
c51926	you, and there remained <i>but</i> wounded men
c51927	every man in his tent,
c51928	among them, <i>yet</i> should they rise up
c51929	and burn this city with fire.
c51930	And it came to pass,
c51931	that when the army of the Chaldeans was broken up from Jerusalem for fear of Pharaoh's army,
c51932	Then Jeremiah went forth out of Jerusalem
c51933	to go into the land of Benjamin,
c51934	to separate himself thence in the midst of the people.
c51935	And when he was in the gate of Benjamin,
c51936	a captain of the ward <i>was</i> there,
c51937	whose name <i>was</i> Irijah, the son of Shelemiah, the son of Hananiah;
c51938	and he took Jeremiah the prophet,
c51939	saying,
c51940	Thou fallest away to the Chaldeans.
c51941	Then said Jeremiah,
c51942	<i>It is</i> false;
c51943	I fall not away to the Chaldeans.
c51944	But he hearkened not to
c51945	him: so Irijah took Jeremiah,
c51946	and brought him to the princes.
c51947	Wherefore the princes were wroth with Jeremiah,
c51948	and smote
c51949	him, and put him in prison in the house of Jonathan the scribe:
c51950	for they had made that the prison.
c51951	When Jeremiah was entered into the dungeon, and into the cabins,
c51952	and Jeremiah had remained there many days;
c51953	Then Zedekiah the king sent,
c51954	and took
c51955	him out: and the king asked him secretly in his house,
c51956	and said,
c51957	Is there <i>any</i> word from the LORD?
c51958	And Jeremiah said,
c51959	There is:
c51960	for, said
c51961	he, thou shalt be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon.
c51962	Moreover Jeremiah said unto king Zedekiah,
c51963	What have I offended against thee, or against thy servants, or against this people,
c51964	that ye have put me in prison?
c51965	Where <i>are</i> now your prophets
c51966	which prophesied
c51967	unto you, saying,
c51968	The king of Babylon shall not come against you, nor against this land?
c51970	Therefore hear now, I pray thee,
c51971	O my lord the king:
c51972	let my supplication, I pray thee, be accepted before
c51973	thee; that thou cause me not to return to the house of Jonathan the scribe,
c51974	lest I die there.
c51975	Then Zedekiah the king commanded
c51976	that they should commit Jeremiah into the court of the prison,
c51977	and that they should give him daily a piece of bread out of the bakers' street,
c51978	until all the bread in the city were spent.
c51979	Thus Jeremiah remained in the court of the prison.
c51980	Then Shephatiah the son of Mattan, and Gedaliah the son of Pashur, and Jucal the son of Shelemiah, and Pashur the son of Malchiah, heard the words
c51981	that Jeremiah had spoken unto all the people,
c51982	saying,
c51983	Thus saith the LORD,
c51984	He that remaineth in this city
c51985	shall die by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence:
c51986	but he that goeth forth to the Chaldeans
c51987	shall live;
c51988	for he shall have his life for a prey,
c51989	and shall live.
c51990	Thus saith the LORD,
c51991	This city shall surely be given into the hand of the king of Babylon's army,
c51992	which shall take it.
c51993	Therefore the princes said unto the king,
c51994	We beseech thee, let this man be put to death:
c51995	for thus he weakeneth the hands of the men of war
c51996	that remain in this city,
c51997	and the hands of all the people,
c51998	in speaking such words unto
c51999	them: for this man
c52000	seeketh not the welfare of this people,
c52001	but the hurt.
c52002	Then Zedekiah the king said,
c52003	Behold, he <i>is</i> in your hand:
c52004	for the king <i>is</i> not
c52005	<i>he that</i> can do <i>any</i> thing against you.
c52006	Then took they Jeremiah,
c52007	and cast him into the dungeon of Malchiah the son of Hammelech,
c52008	that <i>was</i> in the court of the prison:
c52009	and they let down Jeremiah with cords.
c52010	And in the dungeon <i>there was</i> no water,
c52011	but mire:
c52012	so Jeremiah sunk in the mire.
c52013	Now when Ebedmelech the Ethiopian, one of the eunuchs which was in the king's house, heard
c52015	that they had put Jeremiah in the dungeon;
c52016	the king then sitting in the gate of Benjamin;
c52017	Ebedmelech went forth out of the king's house,
c52018	and spake to the king,
c52019	saying,
c52020	My lord the king,
c52021	these men have done evil in all
c52022	that they have done to Jeremiah the prophet,
c52023	whom they have cast into the dungeon;
c52024	and he is like to die for hunger in the place where
c52025	he is: for <i>there is</i> no more bread in the city.
c52026	Then the king commanded Ebedmelech the Ethiopian,
c52027	saying,
c52028	Take from hence thirty men with
c52029	thee, and take up Jeremiah the prophet out of the dungeon,
c52030	before he die.
c52031	So Ebedmelech took the men with
c52032	him, and went into the house of the king under the treasury,
c52033	and took thence old cast clouts and old rotten rags,
c52034	and let them down by cords into the dungeon to Jeremiah.
c52035	And Ebedmelech the Ethiopian said unto Jeremiah,
c52036	Put now <i>these</i> old cast clouts and rotten rags under thine armholes under the cords.
c52037	And Jeremiah did so.
c52038	So they drew up Jeremiah with cords,
c52039	and took him up out of the dungeon:
c52040	and Jeremiah remained in the court of the prison.
c52041	Then Zedekiah the king sent,
c52042	and took Jeremiah the prophet unto him into the third entry
c52043	that <i>is</i> in the house of the LORD:
c52044	and the king said unto Jeremiah,
c52045	I will ask thee a thing;
c52046	hide nothing from me.
c52047	Then Jeremiah said unto Zedekiah,
c52048	If I declare
c52049	<i>it</i> unto thee, wilt thou not surely put me to death?
c52050	and if I give thee counsel,
c52051	wilt thou not hearken unto me?
c52052	So Zedekiah the king sware secretly unto Jeremiah,
c52053	saying,
c52054	<i>As</i> the LORD liveth,
c52055	that made us this soul,
c52056	I will not put thee to death,
c52057	neither will I give thee into the hand of these men
c52058	that seek thy life.
c52059	Then said Jeremiah unto Zedekiah,
c52060	Thus saith the LORD, the God of hosts, the God of Israel;
c52061	If thou wilt assuredly go forth unto the king of Babylon's princes,
c52062	then thy soul shall live,
c52063	and this city shall not be burned with fire;
c52064	and thou shalt live, and thine house:
c52065	But if thou wilt not go forth to the king of Babylon's princes,
c52066	then shall this city be given into the hand of the Chaldeans,
c52067	and they shall burn it with fire,
c52068	and thou shalt not escape out of their hand.
c52069	And Zedekiah the king said unto Jeremiah,
c52070	I am afraid of the Jews
c52071	that are fallen to the Chaldeans,
c52072	lest they deliver me into their hand,
c52073	and they mock me.
c52074	But Jeremiah said,
c52075	They shall not deliver
c52076	<i>thee.</i> Obey, I beseech thee, the voice of the LORD,
c52077	which I speak unto
c52078	thee: so it shall be well
c52079	unto thee, and thy soul shall live.
c52080	But if thou refuse
c52081	to go forth,
c52082	this <i>is</i> the word
c52083	that the LORD hath shewed me:
c52084	And, behold, all the women
c52085	that are left in the king of Judah's house
c52086	<i>shall be</i> brought forth to the king of Babylon's princes,
c52087	and those <i>women</i> shall say,
c52089	Thy friends have set thee on, and have prevailed
c52090	against thee: thy feet are sunk in the mire,
c52091	<i>and</i> they are turned away back.
c52092	So they shall bring out all thy wives and thy children to the Chaldeans:
c52093	and thou shalt not escape out of their hand,
c52094	but shalt be taken by the hand of the king of Babylon:
c52095	and thou shalt cause this city to be burned with fire.
c52096	Then said Zedekiah unto Jeremiah,
c52097	Let no man know of these words,
c52098	and thou shalt not die.
c52099	But if the princes hear
c52100	that I have talked with
c52101	thee, and they come unto
c52102	thee, and say unto
c52103	thee, Declare unto us now
c52104	what thou hast said unto the king,
c52105	hide it not from
c52106	us, and we will not put thee to death;
c52107	also what the king said unto thee:
c52108	Then thou shalt say unto
c52109	them, I presented my supplication before the king,
c52110	that he would not cause me to return to Jonathan's house,
c52111	to die there.
c52112	Then came all the princes unto Jeremiah,
c52113	and asked
c52114	him: and he told them according to all these words
c52115	that the king had commanded.
c52116	So they left off speaking with
c52117	him; for the matter was not perceived.
c52118	So Jeremiah abode in the court of the prison until the day
c52119	that Jerusalem was taken:
c52120	and he was
c52121	<i>there</i> when Jerusalem was taken.
c52122	In the ninth year of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the tenth month, came Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon and all his army against Jerusalem,
c52123	and they besieged it.
c52124	<i>And</i> in the eleventh year of Zedekiah, in the fourth month, the ninth <i>day</i> of the month, the city was broken up.
c52125	And all the princes of the king of Babylon came in,
c52126	and sat in the middle gate,
c52127	<i>even</i> Nergalsharezer, Samgarnebo, Sarsechim, Rabsaris, Nergalsharezer, Rabmag, with all the residue of the princes of the king of Babylon.
c52128	And it came to pass,
c52129	<i>that</i> when Zedekiah the king of Judah saw them, and all the men of war,
c52130	then they fled,
c52131	and went forth out of the city by night, by the way of the king's garden, by the gate betwixt the two walls:
c52132	and he went out the way of the plain.
c52133	But the Chaldeans' army pursued after
c52134	them, and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho:
c52135	and when they had taken him, they brought him up to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon to Riblah in the land of Hamath,
c52137	where he gave judgment upon him.
c52138	Then the king of Babylon slew the sons of Zedekiah in Riblah before his eyes:
c52139	also the king of Babylon slew all the nobles of Judah.
c52140	Moreover he put out Zedekiah's eyes,
c52141	and bound him with chains,
c52142	to carry him to Babylon.
c52143	And the Chaldeans burned the king's house, and the houses of the people, with fire,
c52144	and brake down the walls of Jerusalem.
c52145	Then Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive into Babylon the remnant of the people
c52146	that remained in the city,
c52147	and those that fell away,
c52148	that fell to
c52149	him, with the rest of the people
c52150	that remained.
c52153	which had nothing, in the land of Judah,
c52154	But Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left of the poor of the people,
c52155	and gave them vineyards and fields at the same time.
c52156	Now Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon gave charge concerning Jeremiah to Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard,
c52157	saying,
c52158	Take
c52159	him, and look well to
c52160	him, and do him no harm;
c52161	but
c52162	as he shall say unto thee.
c52163	do unto him even
c52164	So Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard sent, and Nebushasban, Rabsaris, and Nergalsharezer, Rabmag, and all the king of Babylon's princes;
c52165	Even they sent,
c52166	and took Jeremiah out of the court of the prison,
c52167	and committed him unto Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan,
c52168	that he should carry him home:
c52169	so he dwelt among the people.
c52170	Now the word of the LORD came unto Jeremiah,
c52171	while he was shut up in the court of the prison,
c52172	saying,
c52173	Go
c52174	and speak to Ebedmelech the Ethiopian,
c52175	saying,
c52176	Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel;
c52177	Behold, I will bring my words upon this city for evil,
c52178	and not for good;
c52179	and they shall be <i>accomplished</i> in that day before thee.
c52180	But I will deliver thee in that day,
c52181	saith the LORD:
c52182	and thou shalt not be given into the hand of the men
c52183	of whom thou <i>art</i> afraid.
c52184	For I will surely deliver
c52185	thee, and thou shalt not fall by the sword,
c52186	but thy life shall be for a prey
c52187	unto thee: because thou hast put thy trust
c52188	in me, saith the LORD.
c52189	The word
c52190	that came to Jeremiah from the LORD,
c52191	after that Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had let him go from Ramah,
c52192	when he had taken
c52193	him being bound in chains among all that were carried away captive of Jerusalem and Judah,
c52194	which were carried away captive unto Babylon.
c52195	And the captain of the guard took Jeremiah,
c52196	and said unto
c52197	him, The LORD thy God hath pronounced this evil upon this place.
c52199	Now the LORD hath brought <i>it,</i> and done
c52200	according as he hath said:
c52201	because ye have sinned against the LORD,
c52202	and have not obeyed his voice,
c52203	therefore this thing is come upon you.
c52204	And now,
c52205	behold, I loose thee this day from the chains
c52206	which <i>were</i> upon thine hand.
c52207	If it seem good unto thee
c52208	to come with me into Babylon,
c52209	come;
c52210	and I will look well unto
c52211	thee: but if it seem ill unto thee
c52212	to come with me into Babylon,
c52213	forbear:
c52214	behold,
c52215	all the land <i>is</i> before
c52216	thee: whither it seemeth good and convenient
c52217	for thee to go, thither
c52218	go.
c52220	Now while he was not yet gone back,
c52221	<i>he said,</i> Go back also to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan,
c52222	whom the king of Babylon hath made governor over the cities of Judah,
c52223	and dwell with him among the people:
c52224	or go wheresoever
c52225	it seemeth convenient
c52227	unto thee to go.
c52228	So the captain of the guard gave him victuals and a reward,
c52229	and let him go.
c52230	Then went Jeremiah unto Gedaliah the son of Ahikam to Mizpah;
c52231	and dwelt with him among the people
c52232	that were left in the land.
c52233	Now when all the captains of the forces which <i>were</i> in the fields,
c52235	<i>even</i> they and their men, heard
c52236	that the king of Babylon had made Gedaliah the son of Ahikam governor in the land,
c52237	and had committed unto him men, and women, and children, and of the poor of the land,
c52238	of them that were not carried away captive to Babylon;
c52239	Then they came to Gedaliah to Mizpah,
c52240	even Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and Johanan and Jonathan the sons of Kareah, and Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth, and the sons of Ephai the Netophathite, and Jezaniah the son of a Maachathite, they and their men.
c52241	And Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan sware unto them and to their men,
c52242	saying,
c52243	Fear not
c52244	to serve the Chaldeans:
c52245	dwell in the land,
c52246	and serve the king of Babylon,
c52247	and it shall be well with you.
c52248	As for me,
c52249	behold, I will dwell at Mizpah
c52250	to serve the Chaldeans,
c52251	which will come unto
c52252	us: but ye, gather ye wine, and summer fruits, and oil,
c52253	and put <i>them</i> in your vessels,
c52254	and dwell in your cities
c52255	that ye have taken.
c52256	Likewise when all the Jews
c52257	that <i>were</i> in Moab, and among the Ammonites, and in Edom,
c52258	and that <i>were</i> in all the countries,
c52259	heard
c52260	that the king of Babylon had left a remnant of Judah,
c52261	and that he had set over them Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan;
c52262	Even all the Jews returned out of all places
c52263	whither they were driven,
c52264	and came to the land of Judah, to Gedaliah, unto Mizpah,
c52265	and gathered wine and summer fruits very much.
c52266	Moreover Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces
c52267	that <i>were</i> in the fields,
c52268	came to Gedaliah to Mizpah,
c52269	And said unto
c52270	him, Dost thou certainly know
c52271	that Baalis the king of the Ammonites hath sent Ishmael the son of Nethaniah
c52272	to slay
c52273	thee? But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam believed them not.
c52274	Then Johanan the son of Kareah spake to Gedaliah in Mizpah secretly,
c52275	saying,
c52276	Let me go, I pray thee,
c52277	and I will slay Ishmael the son of Nethaniah,
c52278	and no man shall know
c52279	<i>it:</i> wherefore should he slay
c52280	thee, that all the Jews which are gathered unto thee should be scattered,
c52282	and the remnant in Judah perish?
c52283	But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam said unto Johanan the son of Kareah,
c52284	Thou shalt not do this thing:
c52285	for thou speakest falsely of Ishmael.
c52286	Now it came to pass in the seventh month,
c52287	<i>that</i> Ishmael the son of Nethaniah the son of Elishama, of the seed royal, and the princes of the king, even ten men with him, came
c52289	unto Gedaliah the son of Ahikam to Mizpah; and there they did eat bread together in Mizpah.
c52291	Then arose Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and the ten men
c52292	that were with
c52293	him, and smote Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan with the sword,
c52294	and slew
c52295	him, whom the king of Babylon had made governor over the land.
c52297	that were with him, <i>even</i> with Gedaliah, at Mizpah,
c52298	and the Chaldeans
c52299	that were found there, <i>and</i> the men of war.
c52300	Ishmael also slew all the Jews
c52301	And it came to pass the second day
c52302	after he had slain Gedaliah,
c52303	and no man knew <i>it,</i>
c52304	That there came certain from Shechem, from Shiloh, and from Samaria,
c52305	<i>even</i> fourscore men, having their beards shaven, and their clothes rent, and having cut themselves,
c52306	with offerings and incense in their hand,
c52307	to bring <i>them</i> to the house of the LORD.
c52308	And Ishmael the son of Nethaniah went forth
c52309	to meet
c52310	from Mizpah
c52311	all along as he went:
c52312	them, weeping
c52313	and it came to pass,
c52314	as he met
c52315	them, he said unto
c52316	them, Come to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam.
c52317	And it was
c52318	<i>so,</i> when they came into the midst of the city,
c52319	that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah slew them, <i>and cast them</i> into the midst of the pit, he, and the men
c52320	that <i>were</i> with him.
c52321	But ten men were found
c52322	among them that said unto Ishmael,
c52323	Slay us not:
c52324	for we have treasures in the field, of wheat, and of barley, and of oil, and of honey.
c52325	So he forbare,
c52326	and slew them not among their brethren.
c52327	Now the pit
c52328	wherein Ishmael had cast all the dead bodies of the men,
c52329	whom he had slain because of Gedaliah,
c52330	<i>was</i> it
c52331	which Asa the king had made for fear of Baasha king of Israel:
c52332	<i>and</i> Ishmael the son of Nethaniah filled it with <i>them that were</i> slain.
c52333	Then Ishmael carried away captive all the residue of the people
c52334	that <i>were</i> in Mizpah,
c52335	<i>even</i> the king's daughters, and all the people
c52336	that remained in Mizpah,
c52337	whom Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had committed to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam:
c52338	and Ishmael the son of Nethaniah carried them away captive,
c52339	and departed
c52340	to go over to the Ammonites.
c52341	But when Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces that <i>were</i> with him, heard
c52343	of all the evil
c52344	that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had done,
c52345	Then they took all the men,
c52346	and went
c52347	to fight with Ishmael the son of Nethaniah,
c52348	and found him by the great waters
c52349	that <i>are</i> in Gibeon.
c52350	Now it came to pass,
c52351	<i>that</i> when all the people which <i>were</i> with Ishmael saw
c52353	Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces
c52354	that <i>were</i> with
c52355	him, then they were glad.
c52356	So all the people that Ishmael had carried away captive from Mizpah cast about
c52358	and returned,
c52359	and went unto Johanan the son of Kareah.
c52360	But Ishmael the son of Nethaniah escaped from Johanan with eight men,
c52361	and went to the Ammonites.
c52362	Then took Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces
c52363	that <i>were</i> with
c52364	him, all the remnant of the people
c52365	whom he had recovered from Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, from Mizpah,
c52366	after <i>that</i> he had slain Gedaliah the son of Ahikam,
c52367	<i>even</i> mighty men of war, and the women, and the children, and the eunuchs,
c52368	whom he had brought again from Gibeon:
c52369	And they departed,
c52370	and dwelt in the habitation of Chimham,
c52371	which is by Bethlehem,
c52372	to go
c52373	to enter into Egypt,
c52374	Because of the Chaldeans:
c52375	for they were afraid of
c52376	them, because Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had slain Gedaliah the son of Ahikam,
c52377	whom the king of Babylon made governor in the land.
c52378	Then all the captains of the forces, and Johanan the son of Kareah, and Jezaniah the son of Hoshaiah, and all the people from the least even unto the greatest, came near,
c52379	And said unto Jeremiah the prophet,
c52380	Let, we beseech thee, our supplication be accepted before
c52381	thee, and pray for us unto the LORD thy God, <i>even</i> for all this remnant;
c52382	(for we are left <i>but</i> a few of many,
c52383	as thine eyes do behold us:)
c52384	That the LORD thy God may shew us the way
c52385	wherein we may walk,
c52386	and the thing
c52387	that we may do.
c52388	Then Jeremiah the prophet said unto
c52389	them, I have heard
c52390	<i>you;</i> behold, I will pray unto the LORD your God according to your words;
c52391	and it shall come to pass,
c52392	<i>that</i> whatsoever thing
c52393	the LORD shall answer
c52394	you, I will declare
c52395	<i>it</i> unto you; I will keep nothing back from you.
c52396	Then they said to Jeremiah,
c52397	The LORD be a true and faithful witness
c52398	between us, if we do not
c52399	according to all things
c52400	for the which the LORD thy God shall send thee to us.
c52401	even
c52402	Whether <i>it be</i> good,
c52403	or whether <i>it be</i> evil,
c52404	the voice of the LORD our God,
c52405	to whom we send
c52406	we will obey
c52407	thee; that it may be well
c52408	with us, when we obey the voice of the LORD our God.
c52409	And it came to pass after ten days,
c52410	that the word of the LORD came unto Jeremiah.
c52411	Then called he Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces
c52412	which <i>were</i> with
c52413	him, and all the people from the least even to the greatest,
c52414	And said unto
c52415	them, Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel,
c52416	unto whom ye sent
c52417	me to present your supplication before him;
c52418	If ye will still abide in this land,
c52419	then will I build
c52420	you, and not pull <i>you</i> down,
c52421	and I will plant
c52422	you, and not pluck <i>you</i> up:
c52423	for I repent me of the evil
c52424	that I have done unto you.
c52425	Be not afraid of the king of Babylon,
c52426	of whom ye are afraid; be not afraid
c52427	of
c52428	him, saith the LORD:
c52429	for I <i>am</i> with
c52430	you to save
c52431	you, and to deliver you from his hand.
c52432	And I will shew mercies
c52433	unto you, that he may have mercy upon
c52434	you, and cause you to return to your own land.
c52435	But if ye say,
c52436	We will not dwell in this land,
c52437	neither obey the voice of the LORD your God,
c52438	Saying,
c52439	No;
c52440	but we will go into the land of Egypt,
c52441	where we shall see no war,
c52442	nor hear the sound of the trumpet,
c52443	nor have hunger of bread;
c52444	and there will we dwell:
c52445	And now
c52446	therefore hear the word of the LORD,
c52447	ye remnant of Judah;
c52448	Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel;
c52449	If ye wholly set your faces
c52450	to enter into Egypt,
c52451	and go
c52452	to sojourn there;
c52453	Then it shall come to pass,
c52454	<i>that</i> the sword,
c52455	which ye feared,
c52456	shall overtake you there in the land of Egypt,
c52457	and the famine,
c52458	whereof ye were afraid,
c52459	shall follow close after you there in Egypt;
c52460	and there ye shall die.
c52461	So shall it be with all the men
c52462	that set their faces
c52463	to go into Egypt
c52464	to sojourn there;
c52465	they shall die by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence:
c52466	and none of them shall remain or escape from the evil
c52467	that I will bring upon them.
c52468	For thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel;
c52469	As mine anger and my fury hath been poured forth upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem;
c52470	so shall my fury be poured forth upon
c52472	you, when ye shall enter into Egypt: and ye shall be an execration, and an astonishment, and a curse, and a reproach;
c52473	and ye shall see this place no more.
c52474	The LORD hath said concerning
c52475	you, O ye remnant of Judah;
c52476	Go ye not into Egypt:
c52477	know certainly
c52478	that I have admonished you this day.
c52479	For ye dissembled in your hearts,
c52480	when ye sent me unto the LORD your God,
c52481	saying,
c52482	Pray for us unto the LORD our God;
c52483	and according unto all
c52484	that the LORD our God shall say,
c52485	so declare
c52486	unto us, and we will do <i>it.</i>
c52487	And <i>now</i> I have this day declared
c52488	<i>it</i> to you; but ye have not obeyed the voice of the LORD your God,
c52489	nor any
c52490	<i>thing</i> for the which he hath sent me unto you.
c52491	Now therefore know certainly
c52492	that ye shall die by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence, in the place
c52493	whither ye desire
c52494	to go
c52495	<i>and</i> to sojourn.
c52496	And it came to pass,
c52497	<i>that</i> when Jeremiah had made an end
c52498	of speaking unto all the people all the words of the LORD their God,
c52499	for which the LORD their God had sent him to them, <i>even</i> all these words,
c52500	Then spake Azariah the son of Hoshaiah, and Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the proud men,
c52501	saying unto Jeremiah,
c52502	Thou speakest falsely:
c52503	the LORD our God hath not sent
c52504	thee to say,
c52505	Go not into Egypt
c52506	to sojourn there:
c52507	But Baruch the son of Neriah setteth thee on
c52508	against us, for to deliver us into the hand of the Chaldeans,
c52509	that they might put us to death,
c52510	and carry us away captives into Babylon.
c52511	So Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces, and all the people, obeyed not the voice of the LORD,
c52512	to dwell in the land of Judah.
c52513	But Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces, took all the remnant of Judah,
c52514	that were returned from all nations,
c52515	whither they had been driven,
c52516	to dwell in the land of Judah;
c52517	<i>Even</i> men, and women, and children, and the king's daughters, and every person
c52518	that Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had left with Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan,
c52519	and Jeremiah the prophet, and Baruch the son of Neriah.
c52520	So they came into the land of Egypt:
c52521	for they obeyed not the voice of the LORD:
c52522	thus came they <i>even</i> to Tahpanhes.
c52523	Then came the word of the LORD unto Jeremiah in Tahpanhes,
c52524	saying,
c52525	Take great stones in thine hand,
c52526	and hide them in the clay in the brickkiln,
c52527	which <i>is</i> at the entry of Pharaoh's house in Tahpanhes,
c52528	in the sight of the men of Judah;
c52529	And say unto
c52530	them, Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel;
c52531	Behold, I will send
c52532	and take Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon, my servant,
c52533	and will set his throne upon these stones
c52534	that I have hid;
c52535	and he shall spread his royal pavilion over them.
c52536	And when he cometh,
c52537	he shall smite the land of Egypt,
c52538	<i>and deliver</i> such <i>as are</i> for death
c52539	to death;
c52541	and such <i>as are</i> for captivity
c52542	to captivity;
c52544	and such <i>as are</i> for the sword
c52545	to the sword.
c52546	And I will kindle a fire in the houses of the gods of Egypt;
c52547	and he shall burn
c52548	them, and carry them away captives:
c52549	and he shall array himself with the land of Egypt,
c52550	as a shepherd putteth on his garment;
c52551	and he shall go forth from thence in peace.
c52552	He shall break also the images of Bethshemesh, that <i>is</i> in the land of Egypt; and the houses
c52554	of the gods of the Egyptians shall he burn with fire.
c52555	The word
c52556	that came to Jeremiah
c52557	concerning all the Jews
c52558	which dwell in the land of Egypt,
c52559	which dwell at Migdol, and at Tahpanhes, and at Noph, and in the country of Pathros,
c52560	saying,
c52561	Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel;
c52562	Ye have seen all the evil
c52563	that I have brought upon Jerusalem, and upon all the cities of Judah;
c52564	and, behold, this day they <i>are</i> a desolation,
c52565	and no man dwelleth therein,
c52566	Because of their wickedness
c52567	which they have committed
c52568	to provoke me to anger,
c52569	in that they went
c52570	to burn incense,
c52571	<i>and</i> to serve other gods,
c52572	whom they knew not,
c52573	<i>neither</i> they, ye, nor your fathers.
c52574	Howbeit I sent unto you all my servants the prophets, rising early and sending
c52575	<i>them,</i> saying,
c52576	Oh, do not this abominable thing
c52577	that I hate.
c52578	But they hearkened not,
c52579	nor inclined their ear
c52580	to turn from their wickedness,
c52581	to burn no incense unto other gods.
c52582	Wherefore my fury and mine anger was poured forth,
c52583	and was kindled in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem;
c52584	and they are wasted
c52585	<i>and</i> desolate, as at this day.
c52586	Therefore now
c52587	thus saith the LORD, the God of hosts, the God of Israel;
c52588	Wherefore commit ye <i>this</i> great evil against your souls,
c52589	to cut off from you man and woman, child and suckling, out of Judah,
c52590	to leave you none to remain;
c52591	In that ye provoke me unto wrath with the works of your hands,
c52592	burning incense unto other gods in the land of Egypt,
c52593	whither ye be gone
c52594	to dwell,
c52595	that ye might cut yourselves off,
c52596	and that ye might be a curse and a reproach among all the nations of the earth?
c52597	Have ye forgotten the wickedness of your fathers, and the wickedness of the kings of Judah, and the wickedness of their wives, and your own wickedness, and the wickedness of your wives,
c52598	which they have committed in the land of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem?
c52599	They are not humbled <i>even</i> unto this day,
c52600	neither have they feared,
c52601	nor walked in my law, nor in my statutes,
c52602	that I set before you and before your fathers.
c52603	Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel;
c52604	Behold, I will set my face against you for evil,
c52605	and to cut off all Judah.
c52606	And I will take the remnant of Judah,
c52607	that have set their faces
c52608	to go into the land of Egypt
c52609	to sojourn there,
c52610	and they shall all be consumed,
c52611	<i>and</i> fall in the land of Egypt; they shall <i>even</i> be consumed by the sword
c52612	<i>and</i> by the famine: they shall die, from the least even unto the greatest,
c52613	by the sword and by the famine:
c52614	and they shall be an execration, <i>and</i> an astonishment, and a curse, and a reproach.
c52615	For I will punish
c52616	them that dwell in the land of Egypt,
c52617	as I have punished Jerusalem, by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence:
c52618	So that none of the remnant of Judah, which are gone
c52620	into the land of Egypt to sojourn there, shall escape or remain,
c52621	that they should return into the land of Judah,
c52622	to the which they have a desire
c52623	to return
c52624	to dwell there:
c52625	for none shall return
c52626	but such as shall escape.
c52627	Then all the men which knew
c52629	that their wives had burned incense unto other gods,
c52630	and all the women
c52631	that stood by,
c52632	a great multitude, even all the people
c52633	that dwelt in the land of Egypt, in Pathros, answered Jeremiah,
c52634	saying,
c52635	<i>As for</i> the word
c52636	that thou hast spoken unto us in the name of the LORD,
c52637	we will not hearken unto thee.
c52638	But we will certainly do whatsoever thing
c52639	goeth forth out of our own mouth,
c52640	to burn incense unto the queen of heaven,
c52641	and to pour out drink offerings
c52642	unto her, as we have done, we, and our fathers, our kings, and our princes, in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem:
c52643	for <i>then</i> had we plenty of victuals,
c52644	and were well,
c52645	and saw no evil.
c52646	But since we left off
c52647	to burn incense to the queen of heaven,
c52648	and to pour out drink offerings
c52649	unto her, we have wanted all
c52650	<i>things,</i> and have been consumed by the sword and by the famine.
c52651	And when we burned incense to the queen of heaven,
c52652	and poured out drink offerings
c52653	unto her, did we make her cakes to worship
c52655	her, and pour out drink offerings unto her, without our men?
c52656	Then Jeremiah said unto all the people, to the men, and to the women, and to all the people
c52657	which had given him <i>that</i> answer,
c52658	saying,
c52659	did not
c52660	The incense that ye burned in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem, ye, and your fathers, your kings, and your princes, and the people of the land,
c52661	the LORD remember
c52662	them, and came it <i>not</i> into his mind?
c52663	So that the LORD could no longer
c52664	bear,
c52665	because of the evil of your doings, <i>and</i> because of the abominations
c52666	which ye have committed;
c52667	therefore is your land a desolation, and an astonishment, and a curse, without an inhabitant, as at this day.
c52668	Because ye have burned incense,
c52669	and because ye have sinned against the LORD,
c52670	and have not obeyed the voice of the LORD,
c52671	nor walked in his law, nor in his statutes, nor in his testimonies;
c52672	therefore this evil is happened unto you, as at this day.
c52673	Moreover Jeremiah said unto all the people, and to all the women,
c52674	Hear the word of the LORD,
c52675	all Judah
c52676	that <i>are</i> in the land of Egypt:
c52677	Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel,
c52678	saying;
c52679	Ye and your wives
c52680	have both spoken with your mouths,
c52681	and fulfilled with your hand,
c52682	saying,
c52683	We will surely perform our vows
c52684	that we have vowed,
c52685	to burn incense to the queen of heaven,
c52686	and to pour out drink offerings
c52687	unto her: ye will surely accomplish your vows,
c52688	and surely perform your vows.
c52689	Therefore hear ye the word of the LORD,
c52690	all Judah
c52691	that dwell in the land of Egypt;
c52692	Behold, I have sworn by my great name,
c52693	saith the LORD,
c52694	that my name shall no more be
c52695	named in the mouth of any man of Judah
c52696	saying,
c52697	The Lord GOD liveth.
c52698	in all the land of Egypt,
c52699	Behold, I will watch over them for evil,
c52700	and not for good:
c52701	and all the men of Judah that <i>are</i> in the land of Egypt shall be consumed
c52703	by the sword and by the famine,
c52704	until there be an end of them.
c52705	Yet a small number that escape the sword shall return out of the land of Egypt into the land of Judah,
c52706	and all the remnant of Judah, that are gone into the land of Egypt
c52708	to sojourn there, shall know
c52709	whose words shall stand, mine, or theirs.
c52710	And this <i>shall be</i> a sign
c52711	unto you, saith the LORD,
c52712	that I will punish you in this place,
c52713	that ye may know
c52714	that my words shall surely stand against you for evil:
c52715	Thus saith the LORD;
c52716	Behold, I will give Pharaohhophra king of Egypt into the hand of his enemies, and into the hand of them that seek his life;
c52717	as I gave Zedekiah king of Judah into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, his enemy, and that sought his life.
c52718	The word
c52719	that Jeremiah the prophet spake unto Baruch the son of Neriah,
c52720	when he had written these words in a book at the mouth of Jeremiah, in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah,
c52721	saying,
c52722	Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel, unto
c52723	thee, O Baruch;
c52724	Thou didst say,
c52725	Woe is me now!
c52726	for the LORD hath added grief to my sorrow;
c52727	I fainted in my sighing,
c52728	and I find no rest.
c52729	Thus shalt thou say unto
c52730	him, The LORD saith thus;
c52731	Behold,
c52732	<i>that</i> which I have built
c52733	will I break down,
c52735	and that which I have planted
c52736	I will pluck up,
c52737	even this whole land.
c52738	And seekest thou great things
c52739	for thyself? seek <i>them</i> not:
c52740	for, behold, I will bring evil upon all flesh,
c52741	saith the LORD:
c52742	but thy life will I give unto thee for a prey in all places
c52743	whither thou goest.
c52744	The word of the LORD which came to Jeremiah the prophet against the Gentiles;
c52745	Against Egypt, against the army of Pharaohnecho king of Egypt,
c52746	which was by the river Euphrates in Carchemish,
c52747	which Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon smote in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah.
c52748	Order ye the buckler and shield,
c52749	and draw near to battle.
c52750	Harness the horses;
c52751	and get up,
c52752	ye horsemen,
c52753	and stand forth with <i>your</i> helmets;
c52754	furbish the spears,
c52755	<i>and</i> put on the brigandines.
c52756	Wherefore have I seen
c52757	them dismayed
c52758	<i>and</i> turned away back?
c52759	and their mighty ones are beaten down,
c52760	and are fled apace,
c52761	and look not back:
c52762	<i>for</i> fear <i>was</i> round about,
c52763	saith the LORD.
c52764	Let not the swift flee away,
c52765	nor the mighty man escape;
c52766	they shall stumble, and fall toward the north by the river Euphrates.
c52768	Who <i>is</i> this <i>that</i> cometh up as a flood,
c52769	whose waters are moved as the rivers?
c52770	Egypt riseth up like a flood,
c52771	and <i>his</i> waters are moved like the rivers;
c52772	and he saith,
c52773	I will go up,
c52774	<i>and</i> will cover the earth;
c52775	I will destroy the city
c52776	and the inhabitants thereof.
c52777	Come up,
c52778	ye horses;
c52779	and rage,
c52780	ye chariots;
c52781	and let the mighty men come forth;
c52782	the Ethiopians and the Libyans, that handle the shield; and the Lydians, that handle <i>and</i> bend the bow.
c52783	For this <i>is</i> the day of the Lord GOD of hosts,
c52784	a day of vengeance,
c52785	that he may avenge him of his adversaries:
c52786	and the sword shall devour,
c52787	and it shall be satiate
c52788	and made drunk with their blood:
c52789	for the Lord GOD of hosts hath a sacrifice in the north country by the river Euphrates.
c52790	Go up into Gilead,
c52791	and take balm,
c52792	O virgin, the daughter of Egypt:
c52793	in vain shalt thou use many medicines;
c52794	<i>for</i> thou shalt not be cured.
c52795	The nations have heard of thy shame,
c52796	and thy cry hath filled the land:
c52797	for the mighty man hath stumbled against the mighty,
c52798	<i>and</i> they are fallen both together.
c52799	The word
c52800	that the LORD spake to Jeremiah the prophet,
c52801	how Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon should come
c52802	<i>and</i> smite the land of Egypt.
c52803	Declare ye in Egypt,
c52804	and publish in Migdol,
c52805	and publish in Noph and in Tahpanhes:
c52806	say
c52807	ye, Stand fast,
c52808	and prepare
c52809	thee; for the sword shall devour round about thee.
c52810	Why are thy valiant <i>men</i> swept away?
c52811	they stood not,
c52812	because the LORD did drive them.
c52813	He made many to fall,
c52814	yea, one fell upon another:
c52815	and they said,
c52816	Arise,
c52817	and let us go again to our own people, and to the land of our nativity, from the oppressing sword.
c52818	They did cry there,
c52819	Pharaoh king of Egypt <i>is but</i> a noise;
c52820	he hath passed the time appointed.
c52821	<i>As</i> I live,
c52822	saith the King,
c52823	whose name <i>is</i> the LORD of hosts,
c52824	Surely as Tabor <i>is</i> among the mountains, and as Carmel by the sea, <i>so</i> shall he come.
c52825	furnish thyself to go into captivity:
c52826	O thou daughter dwelling in Egypt,
c52827	for Noph shall be waste
c52828	and desolate without an inhabitant.
c52829	Egypt <i>is like</i> a very fair heifer,
c52830	<i>but</i> destruction cometh; it cometh out of the north.
c52832	Also her hired men <i>are</i> in the midst of her like fatted bullocks;
c52833	for they also are turned back,
c52834	<i>and</i> are fled away together:
c52835	they did not stand,
c52836	because the day of their calamity was come upon them, <i>and</i> the time of their visitation.
c52837	The voice thereof shall go like a serpent;
c52838	for they shall march with an army,
c52839	and come against her with axes, as hewers of wood.
c52840	They shall cut down her forest,
c52841	saith the LORD,
c52842	though it cannot be searched;
c52843	because they are more than the grasshoppers,
c52844	and <i>are</i> innumerable.
c52845	The daughter of Egypt shall be confounded;
c52846	she shall be delivered into the hand of the people of the north.
c52847	The LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, saith;
c52848	Behold, I will punish the multitude of No, and Pharaoh, and Egypt, with their gods, and their kings; even Pharaoh,
c52849	and <i>all</i> them that trust in him:
c52850	And I will deliver them into the hand of those that seek their lives, and into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, and into the hand of his servants:
c52851	and afterward it shall be inhabited, as in the days of old,
c52852	saith the LORD.
c52853	But fear not thou,
c52854	O my servant Jacob,
c52855	and be not dismayed,
c52856	O Israel:
c52857	for, behold, I will save thee from afar off,
c52858	and thy seed from the land of their captivity;
c52859	and Jacob shall return,
c52860	and be in rest
c52861	and at ease,
c52862	and none shall make <i>him</i> afraid.
c52863	Fear thou not,
c52864	O Jacob my servant,
c52865	saith the LORD:
c52866	for I <i>am</i> with
c52867	thee; for I will make a full end of all the nations
c52868	whither I have driven
c52869	thee: but I will not make a full end
c52870	of thee, but correct thee in measure;
c52871	yet will I not leave thee wholly unpunished.
c52872	The word of the LORD that came to Jeremiah the prophet against the Philistines,
c52873	before that Pharaoh smote Gaza.
c52874	Thus saith the LORD;
c52875	Behold, waters rise up out of the north,
c52876	and shall be an overflowing flood,
c52877	and shall overflow the land, and all that is therein; the city, and them that dwell
c52878	therein: then the men shall cry,
c52879	and all the inhabitants of the land shall howl.
c52880	At the noise of the stamping of the hoofs of his strong <i>horses,</i> at the rushing of his chariots, <i>and at</i> the rumbling of his wheels,
c52881	the fathers shall not look back to <i>their</i> children for feebleness of hands;
c52882	Because of the day
c52883	that cometh
c52884	to spoil all the Philistines,
c52885	<i>and</i> to cut off from Tyrus and Zidon every helper that remaineth:
c52886	for the LORD will spoil the Philistines, the remnant of the country of Caphtor.
c52887	Baldness is come upon Gaza;
c52888	Ashkelon is cut off
c52889	<i>with</i> the remnant of their valley:
c52890	how long wilt thou cut thyself?
c52891	O
c52892	thou sword of the LORD,
c52893	how long <i>will it be</i> ere thou be quiet?
c52894	put up thyself into thy scabbard,
c52895	rest,
c52896	and be still.
c52897	How can it be quiet,
c52898	seeing the LORD hath given it a charge against Ashkelon, and against the sea shore?
c52899	there hath he appointed it.
c52900	Against Moab
c52901	thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel;
c52902	Woe unto Nebo!
c52903	for it is spoiled:
c52905	Kiriathaim is confounded <i>and</i> taken:
c52906	Misgab is confounded
c52907	and dismayed.
c52908	<i>There shall be</i> no more praise of Moab: in Heshbon
c52909	they have devised evil against
c52910	it; come,
c52911	and let us cut it off from <i>being</i> a nation.
c52912	Also thou shalt be cut down, O Madmen;
c52914	the sword shall pursue thee.
c52915	A voice of crying <i>shall be</i> from Horonaim,
c52916	spoiling and great destruction.
c52917	Moab is destroyed;
c52918	her little ones have caused a cry to be heard.
c52919	For in the going up of Luhith continual weeping shall go up;
c52920	for in the going down of Horonaim the enemies have heard a cry of destruction.
c52921	Flee,
c52922	save your lives,
c52923	and be like the heath in the wilderness.
c52924	For
c52925	because thou hast trusted in thy works and in thy treasures,
c52926	thou shalt also be taken:
c52927	and Chemosh shall go forth into captivity
c52928	<i>with</i> his priests and his princes together.
c52929	And the spoiler shall come upon every city,
c52930	and no city shall escape:
c52931	the valley also shall perish,
c52932	and the plain shall be destroyed,
c52933	as the LORD hath spoken.
c52934	Give wings unto Moab,
c52935	that it may flee and get away:
c52936	for the cities thereof shall be desolate,
c52937	without any to dwell therein.
c52938	Cursed
c52939	<i>be</i> he that doeth the work of the LORD deceitfully,
c52940	and cursed
c52941	<i>be</i> he that keepeth back his sword from blood.
c52942	Moab hath been at ease from his youth,
c52943	and he hath settled on his lees,
c52944	and hath not been emptied from vessel to vessel,
c52945	neither hath he gone into captivity:
c52946	therefore his taste remained
c52947	in him, and his scent is not changed.
c52948	Therefore, behold, the days come,
c52949	saith the LORD,
c52950	that I will send unto him wanderers,
c52951	that shall cause him to wander,
c52952	and shall empty his vessels,
c52953	and break their bottles.
c52954	And Moab shall be ashamed of Chemosh,
c52955	as the house of Israel was ashamed of Bethel their confidence.
c52956	How say
c52957	ye, We <i>are</i> mighty
c52958	and strong men for the war?
c52959	Moab is spoiled,
c52960	and gone up <i>out of</i> her cities,
c52961	and his chosen young men are gone down to the slaughter,
c52962	saith the King,
c52963	whose name <i>is</i> the LORD of hosts.
c52964	The calamity of Moab <i>is</i> near
c52965	to come,
c52966	and his affliction hasteth fast.
c52967	him, bemoan
c52968	All ye that are about
c52969	him; and all ye that know his name,
c52970	say,
c52971	How is the strong staff broken, <i>and</i> the beautiful rod!
c52973	in thirst;
c52974	Thou daughter that dost inhabit Dibon, come down from <i>thy</i> glory, and sit
c52975	for the spoiler of Moab shall come
c52976	upon thee, <i>and</i> he shall destroy thy strong holds.
c52977	stand by the way,
c52978	and espy;
c52979	O inhabitant of Aroer,
c52980	ask him that fleeth, and her that escapeth,
c52981	<i>and</i> say,
c52982	What is done?
c52983	Moab is confounded;
c52984	for it is broken down:
c52985	howl
c52986	and cry;
c52987	tell ye it in Arnon,
c52988	that Moab is spoiled,
c52989	And judgment is come upon the plain country; upon Holon, and upon Jahazah, and upon Mephaath,
c52990	And upon Dibon, and upon Nebo, and upon Bethdiblathaim,
c52991	And upon Kiriathaim, and upon Bethgamul, and upon Bethmeon,
c52992	And upon Kerioth, and upon Bozrah, and upon all the cities of the land of Moab, far or near.
c52993	The horn of Moab is cut off,
c52994	and his arm is broken,
c52995	saith the LORD.
c52996	Make ye him drunken:
c52997	for he magnified <i>himself</i> against the LORD:
c52998	Moab also shall wallow in his vomit,
c52999	and he also shall be in derision.
c53000	For was not Israel a derision
c53001	unto thee? was he found among thieves?
c53002	for since thou spakest of him, thou skippedst for joy.
c53003	leave the cities,
c53004	and dwell in the rock,
c53005	O ye that dwell in Moab,
c53006	and be like the dove
c53007	<i>that</i> maketh her nest in the sides of the hole's mouth.
c53008	We have heard
c53009	the pride of Moab, (he is exceeding proud)
c53010	his loftiness, and his arrogancy, and his pride, and the haughtiness of his heart.
c53011	I know
c53012	saith the LORD;
c53013	his wrath,
c53014	but <i>it shall</i> not <i>be</i> so; his lies
c53015	shall not so effect <i>it.</i>
c53016	Therefore will I howl for Moab,
c53017	and I will cry out for all Moab;
c53018	<i>mine heart</i> shall mourn for the men of Kirheres.
c53019	I will weep for thee with the weeping of Jazer:
c53020	O vine of Sibmah,
c53021	thy plants are gone over the sea,
c53022	they reach <i>even</i> to the sea of Jazer:
c53023	the spoiler is fallen upon thy summer fruits and upon thy vintage.
c53024	And joy and gladness is taken from the plentiful field, and from the land of Moab;
c53025	and I have caused wine to fail from the winepresses:
c53026	none shall tread with shouting;
c53027	<i>their</i> shouting <i>shall be</i> no shouting.
c53028	From the cry of Heshbon <i>even</i> unto Elealeh, <i>and even</i> unto Jahaz, have they uttered their voice,
c53029	from Zoar <i>even</i> unto Horonaim, <i>as</i> an heifer of three years old:
c53030	for the waters also of Nimrim shall be desolate.
c53031	Moreover I will cause to cease in Moab,
c53032	saith the LORD,
c53033	him that offereth in the high places,
c53034	and him that burneth incense to his gods.
c53035	Therefore mine heart shall sound for Moab like pipes,
c53036	and mine heart shall sound like pipes for the men of Kirheres:
c53037	because the riches <i>that</i> he hath gotten
c53038	are perished.
c53039	For every head <i>shall be</i> bald,
c53040	and every beard clipped:
c53041	upon all the hands <i>shall be</i> cuttings,
c53042	and upon the loins sackcloth.
c53043	<i>There shall be</i> lamentation generally upon all the housetops of Moab, and in the streets
c53044	thereof: for I have broken Moab like a vessel
c53045	wherein <i>is</i> no pleasure,
c53046	saith the LORD.
c53047	<i>saying,</i> How is it broken down!
c53048	They shall howl,
c53049	how hath Moab turned the back
c53050	with shame!
c53051	so shall Moab be a derision and a dismaying to all them about him.
c53052	For thus saith the LORD;
c53053	Behold, he shall fly as an eagle,
c53054	and shall spread his wings over Moab.
c53055	Kerioth is taken,
c53056	and the strong holds are surprised,
c53057	and the mighty men's hearts in Moab at that day shall be as the heart of a woman in her pangs.
c53058	And Moab shall be destroyed from <i>being</i> a people,
c53059	because he hath magnified <i>himself</i> against the LORD.
c53060	Fear, and the pit, and the snare, <i>shall be</i> upon
c53061	thee, O inhabitant of Moab,
c53062	saith the LORD.
c53063	He that fleeth from the fear
c53064	shall fall into the pit;
c53066	and he that getteth up out of the pit
c53067	shall be taken in the snare:
c53068	for I will bring upon it, <i>even</i> upon Moab, the year of their visitation,
c53069	saith the LORD.
c53071	They that fled stood under the shadow of Heshbon because of the force:
c53072	but a fire shall come forth out of Heshbon,
c53073	and a flame from the midst of Sihon,
c53074	and shall devour the corner of Moab, and the crown of the head of the tumultuous ones.
c53075	Woe
c53076	be unto thee, O Moab!
c53077	the people of Chemosh perisheth:
c53078	for thy sons are taken captives,
c53079	and thy daughters captives.
c53080	Yet will I bring again the captivity of Moab in the latter days,
c53081	saith the LORD.
c53082	Thus far <i>is</i> the judgment of Moab.
c53083	Concerning the Ammonites,
c53084	thus saith the LORD;
c53085	Hath Israel no sons?
c53086	hath he no heir?
c53087	why <i>then</i> doth their king inherit Gad,
c53088	and his people dwell in his cities?
c53089	Therefore, behold, the days come,
c53090	saith the LORD.
c53091	that I will cause an alarm of war to be heard in Rabbah of the Ammonites;
c53092	and it shall be a desolate heap,
c53093	and her daughters shall be burned with fire:
c53094	then shall Israel be heir unto them that were his heirs,
c53095	saith the LORD,
c53096	Howl,
c53097	O Heshbon,
c53098	for Ai is spoiled:
c53099	cry,
c53100	ye daughters of Rabbah,
c53101	gird you with sackcloth;
c53102	lament,
c53103	and run to and fro by the hedges;
c53104	for their king shall go into captivity,
c53105	<i>and</i> his priests and his princes together.
c53106	Wherefore gloriest thou in the valleys,
c53107	thy flowing valley,
c53108	O backsliding daughter?
c53109	that trusted in her treasures,
c53110	<i>saying,</i> Who shall come unto me?
c53111	Behold, I will bring a fear upon
c53112	thee, saith the Lord GOD of hosts,
c53113	from all those that be about
c53114	thee; and ye shall be driven out
c53115	every man right forth;
c53116	and none shall gather up him that wandereth.
c53117	And afterward I will bring again the captivity of the children of Ammon,
c53118	saith the LORD.
c53119	Concerning Edom,
c53120	thus saith the LORD of hosts;
c53121	<i>Is</i> wisdom no more in Teman?
c53122	is counsel perished from the prudent?
c53123	is their wisdom vanished?
c53124	Flee
c53125	ye, turn back,
c53126	deep,
c53127	dwell
c53128	O inhabitants of Dedan;
c53129	for I will bring the calamity of Esau upon
c53130	him, the time
c53131	<i>that</i> I will visit him.
c53132	If grapegatherers come
c53133	to thee, would they not leave <i>some</i> gleaning grapes?
c53134	if thieves by night,
c53135	they will destroy till they have enough.
c53136	But I have made Esau bare,
c53137	I have uncovered his secret places,
c53138	to hide himself:
c53139	and he shall not be able
c53140	his seed is spoiled, and his brethren, and his neighbours,
c53141	and he <i>is</i> not.
c53142	Leave thy fatherless children,
c53143	I will preserve <i>them</i> alive;
c53144	and let thy widows trust in me.
c53145	For thus saith the LORD;
c53146	Behold,
c53147	they whose judgment <i>was</i> not
c53148	to drink of the cup
c53149	have assuredly drunken;
c53150	and <i>art</i> thou he
c53151	<i>that</i> shall altogether go unpunished?
c53152	thou shalt not go unpunished,
c53153	but thou shalt surely drink <i>of it.</i>
c53154	For I have sworn
c53155	by myself, saith the LORD,
c53156	that Bozrah shall become a desolation, a reproach, a waste, and a curse;
c53157	and all the cities thereof shall be perpetual wastes.
c53158	I have heard a rumour from the LORD,
c53159	and an ambassador is sent unto the heathen,
c53160	<i>saying,</i> Gather ye together,
c53161	and come against
c53162	her, and rise up to the battle.
c53163	For, lo, I will make thee small among the heathen,
c53164	<i>and</i> despised among men.
c53165	Thy terribleness hath deceived
c53166	thee, <i>and</i> the pride of thine heart,
c53167	O thou that dwellest in the clefts of the rock,
c53168	that holdest the height of the hill:
c53169	though thou shouldest make thy nest as high as the eagle,
c53170	I will bring thee down from thence,
c53171	saith the LORD.
c53172	Also Edom shall be a desolation:
c53173	every one
c53174	that goeth by
c53175	it shall be astonished,
c53176	and shall hiss at all the plagues thereof.
c53177	As in the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah and the neighbour
c53178	<i>cities</i> thereof, saith the LORD,
c53179	no man shall abide there,
c53180	neither shall a son of man dwell in it.
c53181	Behold, he shall come up like a lion from the swelling of Jordan against the habitation of the strong:
c53182	but I will suddenly
c53183	make him run away from
c53184	her: and who <i>is</i> a chosen
c53185	<i>man, that</i> I may appoint over
c53186	her? for who <i>is</i> like me?
c53187	and who will appoint
c53188	me the time? and who <i>is</i> that shepherd
c53189	that will stand before me?
c53190	Therefore hear the counsel of the LORD,
c53191	that he hath taken against Edom;
c53192	and his purposes,
c53193	that he hath purposed against the inhabitants of Teman:
c53194	Surely the least of the flock shall draw them out:
c53195	surely he shall make their habitations desolate with them.
c53196	at the noise of their fall,
c53197	The earth is moved
c53198	at the cry
c53199	the noise thereof was heard in the Red sea.
c53200	Behold, he shall come up and fly as the eagle,
c53202	and spread his wings over Bozrah:
c53203	and at that day shall the heart of the mighty men of Edom be as the heart of a woman in her pangs.
c53204	Concerning Damascus.
c53205	Hamath is confounded, and Arpad:
c53206	for they have heard evil tidings:
c53207	they are fainthearted;
c53208	<i>there is</i> sorrow on the sea;
c53209	be quiet.
c53210	it cannot
c53211	Damascus is waxed feeble,
c53212	<i>and</i> turneth herself
c53213	to flee,
c53214	and fear hath seized
c53215	on <i>her:</i> anguish and sorrows have taken her, as a woman in travail.
c53216	How is the city of praise not left,
c53217	the city of my joy!
c53218	Therefore her young men shall fall in her streets,
c53219	and all the men of war shall be cut off in that day,
c53220	saith the LORD of hosts.
c53221	And I will kindle a fire in the wall of Damascus,
c53222	and it shall consume the palaces of Benhadad.
c53223	Concerning Kedar, and concerning the kingdoms of Hazor,
c53224	which Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon shall smite,
c53225	thus saith the LORD;
c53226	Arise
c53227	ye, go up to Kedar,
c53228	and spoil the men of the east.
c53229	Their tents and their flocks shall they take away:
c53230	they shall take to themselves their curtains, and all their vessels, and their camels;
c53231	and they shall cry unto
c53232	them, Fear <i>is</i> on every side.
c53233	Flee,
c53234	get you far off,
c53235	deep,
c53236	dwell
c53237	O ye inhabitants of Hazor,
c53238	saith the LORD;
c53239	for Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon hath taken counsel against
c53240	you, and hath conceived a purpose against you.
c53241	Arise,
c53242	get you up unto the wealthy nation,
c53243	that dwelleth without care,
c53244	saith the LORD,
c53245	which have neither gates
c53246	nor bars,
c53247	<i>which</i> dwell alone.
c53248	And their camels shall be a booty,
c53249	and the multitude of their cattle a spoil:
c53250	and I will scatter into all winds them <i>that are</i> in the utmost corners;
c53251	and I will bring their calamity from all sides
c53252	thereof, saith the LORD.
c53253	And Hazor shall be a dwelling for dragons,
c53254	<i>and</i> a desolation for ever:
c53255	there shall no man abide there,
c53256	nor <i>any</i> son of man dwell in it.
c53257	The word of the LORD that came to Jeremiah the prophet against Elam in the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah,
c53258	saying,
c53259	Thus saith the LORD of hosts;
c53260	Behold, I will break the bow of Elam, the chief of their might.
c53261	And upon Elam will I bring the four winds from the four quarters of heaven,
c53262	and will scatter them toward all those winds;
c53263	and there shall be no nation
c53264	whither the outcasts of Elam shall not come.
c53265	For I will cause Elam to be dismayed before their enemies, and before them that seek their life:
c53266	and I will bring evil upon them, <i>even</i> my fierce anger,
c53267	saith the LORD;
c53268	and I will send the sword after
c53269	them, till I have consumed them:
c53270	And I will set my throne in Elam,
c53271	and will destroy from thence the king and the princes,
c53272	saith the LORD.
c53273	But it shall come to pass in the latter days,
c53274	<i>that</i> I will bring again the captivity of Elam,
c53275	saith the LORD.
c53276	The word
c53277	that the LORD spake against Babylon <i>and</i> against the land of the Chaldeans by Jeremiah the prophet.
c53278	Declare ye among the nations,
c53279	and publish,
c53280	and set up a standard;
c53281	publish,
c53282	<i>and</i> conceal not:
c53283	say,
c53284	Babylon is taken,
c53285	Bel is confounded,
c53286	Merodach is broken in pieces;
c53287	her idols are confounded,
c53288	her images are broken in pieces.
c53289	For out of the north there cometh up a nation against
c53290	her, which shall make her land desolate,
c53291	and none shall dwell therein: they shall remove,
c53293	they shall depart, both man and beast.
c53294	In those days, and in that time,
c53295	saith the LORD,
c53296	the children of Israel shall come, they and the children of Judah together,
c53297	going and weeping: they shall go,
c53298	and seek the LORD their God.
c53299	to Zion
c53300	They shall ask the way
c53301	with their faces thitherward,
c53302	<i>saying,</i> Come,
c53303	and let us join ourselves to the LORD in a perpetual covenant
c53304	<i>that</i> shall not be forgotten.
c53305	My people hath been lost sheep:
c53306	their shepherds have caused them to go astray,
c53307	they have turned them away <i>on</i> the mountains:
c53308	they have gone from mountain to hill,
c53309	they have forgotten their restingplace.
c53310	All that found them have devoured
c53311	them: and their adversaries said,
c53312	We offend not,
c53313	because they have sinned against the LORD, the habitation of justice, even the LORD, the hope of their fathers.
c53314	Remove out of the midst of Babylon,
c53315	and go forth out of the land of the Chaldeans,
c53316	and be as the he goats before the flocks.
c53317	For, lo, I will raise
c53318	and cause to come up against Babylon an assembly of great nations from the north country:
c53319	and they shall set themselves in array
c53320	against her; from thence she shall be taken:
c53321	their arrows <i>shall be</i> as of a mighty expert
c53322	man; none shall return in vain.
c53323	And Chaldea shall be a spoil: all that spoil
c53324	her shall be satisfied,
c53325	saith the LORD.
c53326	Because ye were glad,
c53327	because ye rejoiced,
c53328	O ye destroyers of mine heritage,
c53329	because ye are grown fat as the heifer at grass,
c53330	and bellow as bulls;
c53331	Your mother shall be sore confounded;
c53332	she that bare you shall be ashamed:
c53333	behold, the hindermost of the nations <i>shall be</i> a wilderness, a dry land, and a desert.
c53334	Because of the wrath of the LORD it shall not be inhabited,
c53335	but it shall be wholly desolate:
c53337	every one
c53338	that goeth by Babylon
c53339	shall be astonished,
c53340	and hiss at all her plagues.
c53341	Put yourselves in array against Babylon round about:
c53342	all ye that bend the bow,
c53343	shoot at
c53344	her, spare no arrows:
c53345	for she hath sinned against the LORD.
c53346	Shout against her round about:
c53347	she hath given her hand:
c53348	her foundations are fallen,
c53349	her walls are thrown down:
c53350	for it <i>is</i> the vengeance of the LORD:
c53351	take vengeance
c53352	upon her; as she hath done,
c53353	do unto her.
c53354	Cut off the sower from Babylon,
c53355	and him that handleth the sickle in the time of harvest:
c53356	for fear of the oppressing sword
c53357	every one to his people,
c53358	they shall turn
c53360	every one to his own land.
c53361	and they shall flee
c53362	Israel <i>is</i> a scattered sheep;
c53363	the lions have driven <i>him</i> away:
c53364	first
c53365	the king of Assyria hath devoured
c53366	him; and last this
c53367	Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon hath broken his bones.
c53368	Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel;
c53369	Behold, I will punish the king of Babylon and his land,
c53370	as I have punished the king of Assyria.
c53371	And I will bring Israel again to his habitation,
c53372	and he shall feed on Carmel and Bashan, and his soul shall be satisfied upon mount Ephraim
c53373	and Gilead.
c53374	In those days, and in that time,
c53375	saith the LORD,
c53376	the iniquity of Israel shall be sought for,
c53377	and <i>there shall be</i> none;
c53378	and the sins of Judah,
c53379	and they shall not be found:
c53380	for I will pardon
c53381	them whom I reserve.
c53383	Go up against the land of Merathaim, <i>even</i> against it, and against the inhabitants of Pekod:
c53384	waste
c53385	and utterly destroy after
c53386	them, saith the LORD,
c53387	and do according to all
c53388	that I have commanded thee.
c53389	A sound of battle <i>is</i> in the land,
c53390	and of great destruction.
c53391	How is the hammer of the whole earth cut asunder
c53392	and broken!
c53393	how is Babylon become a desolation among the nations!
c53394	I have laid a snare
c53395	for thee, and thou art also taken,
c53396	O Babylon,
c53397	and thou wast not aware:
c53398	thou art found,
c53399	and also caught,
c53400	because thou hast striven against the LORD.
c53401	The LORD hath opened his armoury,
c53402	and hath brought forth the weapons of his indignation:
c53403	for this <i>is</i> the work
c53404	of the Lord GOD of hosts in the land of the Chaldeans.
c53405	Come against her from the utmost border,
c53406	open her storehouses:
c53407	cast her up as heaps,
c53408	and destroy
c53409	her utterly: let nothing of her be left.
c53410	Slay all her bullocks;
c53411	let them go down to the slaughter:
c53412	woe unto
c53413	them! for their day is come, the time of their visitation.
c53414	The voice of them that flee and escape out of the land of Babylon,
c53415	to declare in Zion the vengeance of the LORD our God, the vengeance of his temple.
c53416	Call together the archers against Babylon:
c53417	all ye that bend the bow,
c53418	camp against it round about;
c53419	let none thereof escape:
c53420	recompense her according to her work;
c53421	according to all
c53422	that she hath done,
c53423	do
c53424	unto her: for she hath been proud against the LORD, against the Holy One of Israel.
c53425	Therefore shall her young men fall in the streets,
c53426	and all her men of war shall be cut off in that day,
c53427	saith the LORD.
c53428	Behold, I <i>am</i> against
c53429	thee, <i>O thou</i> most proud,
c53430	saith the Lord GOD of hosts:
c53431	for thy day is come, the time
c53432	<i>that</i> I will visit thee.
c53433	And the most proud shall stumble
c53434	and fall,
c53435	and none shall raise him up:
c53436	and I will kindle a fire in his cities,
c53437	and it shall devour all round about him.
c53438	Thus saith the LORD of hosts;
c53439	The children of Israel and the children of Judah <i>were</i> oppressed together:
c53440	and all that took them captives held them fast;
c53441	they refused
c53442	to let them go.
c53443	Their Redeemer <i>is</i> strong;
c53444	the LORD of hosts <i>is</i> his name:
c53445	he shall throughly plead their cause,
c53446	that he may give rest to the land,
c53447	and disquiet the inhabitants of Babylon.
c53448	A sword <i>is</i> upon the Chaldeans,
c53449	saith the LORD,
c53450	and upon the inhabitants of Babylon, and upon her princes, and upon her wise <i>men.</i>
c53451	A sword <i>is</i> upon the liars;
c53452	and they shall dote:
c53453	a sword <i>is</i> upon her mighty men;
c53454	and they shall be dismayed.
c53455	A sword <i>is</i> upon their horses, and upon their chariots, and upon all the mingled people
c53456	that <i>are</i> in the midst
c53457	of her; and they shall become as women:
c53458	a sword <i>is</i> upon her treasures;
c53459	and they shall be robbed.
c53460	A drought <i>is</i> upon her waters;
c53461	and they shall be dried up:
c53462	for it <i>is</i> the land of graven images, and they
c53463	are mad upon <i>their</i> idols.
c53464	Therefore the wild beasts of the desert with the wild beasts of the islands shall dwell
c53465	<i>there,</i> and the owls shall dwell
c53466	therein: and it shall be no more inhabited for ever;
c53467	neither shall it be dwelt in from generation to generation.
c53468	As God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah and the neighbour
c53469	<i>cities</i> thereof, saith the LORD;
c53470	<i>so</i> shall no man abide there,
c53471	neither shall any son of man dwell therein.
c53472	Behold, a people shall come from the north,
c53473	and a great nation, and many kings shall be raised up from the coasts of the earth.
c53474	They shall hold the bow and the lance:
c53475	they <i>are</i> cruel,
c53476	and will not shew mercy:
c53477	their voice shall roar like the sea,
c53478	and they shall ride upon horses,
c53479	<i>every one</i> put in array, like a man to the battle, against
c53480	thee, O daughter of Babylon.
c53481	The king of Babylon hath heard the report
c53482	of them, and his hands waxed feeble:
c53483	anguish took hold
c53484	of him, <i>and</i> pangs as of a woman in travail.
c53485	Behold, he shall come up like a lion from the swelling of Jordan unto the habitation of the strong:
c53486	but I will make them suddenly
c53487	run away from
c53489	her: and who <i>is</i> a chosen
c53490	<i>man, that</i> I may appoint over
c53491	her? for who <i>is</i> like me?
c53492	and who will appoint me the time?
c53493	and who <i>is</i> that shepherd
c53494	that will stand before me?
c53495	Therefore hear ye the counsel of the LORD,
c53496	that he hath taken against Babylon;
c53497	and his purposes,
c53498	that he hath purposed against the land of the Chaldeans:
c53499	Surely the least of the flock shall draw them out:
c53500	surely he shall make <i>their</i> habitation desolate with them.
c53501	At the noise
c53502	of the taking of Babylon
c53503	the earth is moved,
c53504	and the cry is heard among the nations.
c53505	Thus saith the LORD;
c53506	Behold, I will raise up against Babylon, and against them that dwell in the midst of them that rise up against me, a destroying wind;
c53507	And will send unto Babylon fanners,
c53508	that shall fan
c53509	her, and shall empty her land:
c53510	for in the day of trouble they shall be against her round about.
c53511	Against <i>him that</i> bendeth
c53512	let the archer bend his bow,
c53514	and against <i>him that</i> lifteth himself up in his brigandine: and spare ye not her young men;
c53515	destroy ye utterly all her host.
c53516	Thus the slain shall fall in the land of the Chaldeans,
c53517	and <i>they that are</i> thrust through in her streets.
c53518	For Israel <i>hath</i> not <i>been</i> forsaken, nor Judah of his God, of the LORD of hosts;
c53519	though their land was filled with sin against the Holy One of Israel.
c53520	Flee out of the midst of Babylon,
c53521	and deliver every man his soul:
c53522	be not cut off in her iniquity;
c53523	for this <i>is</i> the time of the LORD'S vengeance;
c53524	he will render unto her a recompence.
c53525	Babylon <i>hath been</i> a golden cup in the LORD'S hand,
c53526	that made all the earth drunken:
c53527	the nations have drunken of her wine;
c53528	therefore the nations are mad.
c53529	Babylon is suddenly fallen
c53530	and destroyed:
c53531	howl for
c53532	her; take balm for her pain,
c53533	if so be she may be healed.
c53534	We would have healed Babylon,
c53535	but she is not healed:
c53536	forsake
c53537	her, and let us go
c53538	every one into his own country:
c53539	for her judgment reacheth unto heaven,
c53540	and is lifted up <i>even</i> to the skies.
c53541	The LORD hath brought forth our righteousness:
c53542	come,
c53543	and let us declare in Zion the work of the LORD our God.
c53544	Make bright the arrows;
c53545	gather the shields:
c53546	the LORD hath raised up the spirit of the kings of the Medes:
c53547	for his device <i>is</i> against Babylon,
c53548	to destroy
c53549	it; because it <i>is</i> the vengeance of the LORD,
c53550	the vengeance of his temple.
c53551	Set up the standard upon the walls of Babylon,
c53552	make the watch strong,
c53553	set up the watchmen,
c53554	prepare the ambushes:
c53555	for the LORD hath both devised
c53556	and done
c53557	that which he spake against the inhabitants of Babylon.
c53558	O thou that dwellest upon many waters,
c53559	abundant in treasures,
c53560	thine end is come,
c53561	<i>and</i> the measure of thy covetousness.
c53562	The LORD of hosts hath sworn by himself,
c53563	<i>saying,</i> Surely I will fill thee with men, as with caterpillers;
c53564	and they shall lift up a shout against thee.
c53565	He hath made the earth by his power,
c53566	he hath established the world by his wisdom,
c53567	and hath stretched out the heaven by his understanding.
c53568	<i>his</i> voice,
c53569	When he uttereth
c53570	<i>there is</i> a multitude of waters in the heavens;
c53571	and he causeth the vapours to ascend from the ends of the earth:
c53572	he maketh lightnings with rain,
c53573	and bringeth forth the wind out of his treasures.
c53574	Every man is brutish by <i>his</i> knowledge;
c53575	every founder is confounded by the graven image:
c53576	for his molten image <i>is</i> falsehood,
c53577	and <i>there is</i> no breath in them.
c53578	They <i>are</i> vanity,
c53579	the work of errors:
c53580	in the time of their visitation they shall perish.
c53581	The portion of Jacob <i>is</i> not like them;
c53582	for he <i>is</i> the former of all things:
c53583	and <i>Israel is</i> the rod of his inheritance:
c53584	the LORD of hosts <i>is</i> his name.
c53585	Thou <i>art</i> my battle axe
c53586	<i>and</i> weapons of war:
c53587	for with thee will I break in pieces the nations,
c53588	and with thee will I destroy kingdoms;
c53589	And with thee will I break in pieces the horse and his rider;
c53590	and with thee will I break in pieces the chariot and his rider;
c53591	With thee also will I break in pieces man and woman;
c53592	and with thee will I break in pieces old and young;
c53593	and with thee will I break in pieces the young man and the maid;
c53594	I will also break in pieces with thee the shepherd and his flock;
c53595	and with thee will I break in pieces the husbandman and his yoke of oxen;
c53596	and with thee will I break in pieces captains and rulers.
c53597	And I will render unto Babylon and to all the inhabitants of Chaldea all their evil
c53598	that they have done in Zion
c53599	in your sight,
c53600	saith the LORD.
c53601	Behold, I <i>am</i> against
c53602	thee, O destroying mountain,
c53603	saith the LORD,
c53604	which destroyest all the earth:
c53605	and I will stretch out mine hand upon
c53606	thee, and roll thee down from the rocks,
c53607	and will make thee a burnt mountain.
c53608	And they shall not take of thee a stone for a corner, nor a stone for foundations;
c53609	but thou shalt be desolate for ever,
c53610	saith the LORD.
c53611	Set ye up a standard in the land,
c53612	blow the trumpet among the nations,
c53613	prepare the nations against
c53614	her, call together against her the kingdoms of Ararat, Minni, and Ashchenaz;
c53615	appoint a captain against
c53616	her; cause the horses to come up as the rough caterpillers.
c53617	Prepare against her the nations with the kings of the Medes, the captains thereof, and all the rulers thereof, and all the land of his dominion.
c53618	And the land shall tremble
c53619	and sorrow:
c53620	for every purpose of the LORD shall be performed against Babylon,
c53621	to make the land of Babylon a desolation without an inhabitant.
c53622	The mighty men of Babylon have forborn
c53623	to fight,
c53624	they have remained in <i>their</i> holds:
c53625	their might hath failed;
c53626	they became as women:
c53627	they have burned her dwellingplaces;
c53628	her bars are broken.
c53629	One post
c53630	shall run to meet
c53631	another,
c53632	and one messenger
c53633	to meet another,
c53634	to shew the king of Babylon
c53635	that his city is taken at <i>one</i> end,
c53636	And that the passages are stopped,
c53637	and the reeds they have burned with fire,
c53638	and the men of war are affrighted.
c53639	For thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel;
c53640	The daughter of Babylon <i>is</i> like a threshingfloor,
c53641	<i>it is</i> time
c53642	to thresh
c53643	her: yet a little while,
c53644	and the time of her harvest shall come.
c53646	Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon hath devoured me, he hath crushed
c53647	me, he hath made me an empty vessel,
c53648	he hath swallowed me up like a dragon,
c53649	he hath filled his belly with my delicates,
c53650	he hath cast me out.
c53651	The violence done to me and to my flesh <i>be</i> upon Babylon,
c53652	shall the inhabitant of Zion say;
c53653	and my blood upon the inhabitants of Chaldea,
c53654	shall Jerusalem say.
c53655	Therefore thus saith the LORD;
c53656	Behold, I will plead thy cause,
c53657	and take vengeance for thee;
c53658	and I will dry up her sea,
c53659	and make her springs dry.
c53660	And Babylon shall become heaps, a dwellingplace for dragons, an astonishment, and an hissing, without an inhabitant.
c53661	They shall roar together like lions:
c53662	they shall yell as lions' whelps.
c53663	In their heat
c53664	I will make their feasts,
c53665	and I will make them drunken,
c53666	that they may rejoice,
c53667	and sleep a perpetual sleep,
c53668	and not wake,
c53669	saith the LORD.
c53670	I will bring them down like lambs
c53671	to the slaughter,
c53672	like rams with he goats.
c53673	How is Sheshach taken!
c53674	and how is the praise of the whole earth surprised!
c53675	how is Babylon become an astonishment among the nations!
c53676	The sea is come up upon Babylon:
c53677	she is covered with the multitude of the waves thereof.
c53678	Her cities are a desolation, a dry land, and a wilderness, a land
c53679	wherein no man dwelleth,
c53680	neither doth <i>any</i> son of man pass thereby.
c53681	And I will punish Bel in Babylon,
c53682	and I will bring forth out of his mouth that which he hath swallowed up:
c53683	and the nations shall not flow together any more unto
c53684	him: yea, the wall of Babylon shall fall.
c53685	go ye out of the midst
c53686	My people,
c53687	of her, and deliver
c53688	ye every man his soul
c53689	from the fierce anger of the LORD.
c53690	And lest your heart faint,
c53691	and ye fear for the rumour
c53692	that shall be heard in the land;
c53693	a rumour shall both come <i>one</i> year,
c53694	and after that in <i>another</i> year <i>shall come</i> a rumour,
c53695	and violence in the land,
c53696	ruler against ruler.
c53697	Therefore, behold, the days come,
c53698	that I will do judgment upon the graven images of Babylon:
c53699	and her whole land shall be confounded,
c53700	and all her slain shall fall in the midst of her.
c53701	Then the heaven and the earth, and all that <i>is</i> therein, shall sing for Babylon:
c53703	for the spoilers shall come unto her from the north,
c53704	saith the LORD.
c53705	As Babylon
c53706	<i>hath caused</i> the slain of Israel to fall,
c53707	so at Babylon shall fall the slain of all the earth.
c53708	Ye that have escaped the sword,
c53709	go away,
c53710	stand not still:
c53711	remember the LORD afar off,
c53712	and let Jerusalem come into your mind.
c53713	We are confounded,
c53714	because we have heard reproach:
c53715	shame hath covered our faces:
c53716	for strangers are come into the sanctuaries of the LORD'S house.
c53717	Wherefore, behold, the days come,
c53718	saith the LORD,
c53719	that I will do judgment upon her graven images:
c53720	and through all her land the wounded shall groan.
c53721	Though Babylon should mount up to heaven,
c53722	and though she should fortify the height of her strength,
c53723	<i>yet</i> from me shall spoilers come
c53724	unto her, saith the LORD.
c53725	A sound of a cry <i>cometh</i> from Babylon,
c53726	and great destruction from the land of the Chaldeans:
c53727	Because the LORD hath spoiled Babylon,
c53728	and destroyed out of her the great voice;
c53729	when her waves do roar like great waters,
c53730	a noise of their voice is uttered:
c53731	Because the spoiler is come upon her, <i>even</i> upon Babylon,
c53732	and her mighty men are taken,
c53733	every one of their bows is broken:
c53734	for the LORD God of recompences shall surely requite.
c53735	And I will make drunk her princes, and her wise <i>men,</i> her captains, and her rulers, and her mighty men:
c53736	and they shall sleep a perpetual sleep,
c53737	and not wake,
c53738	saith the King,
c53739	whose name <i>is</i> the LORD of hosts.
c53740	Thus saith the LORD of hosts;
c53741	The broad walls of Babylon shall be utterly broken,
c53742	and her high gates shall be burned with fire;
c53743	and the people shall labour in vain,
c53744	and the folk in the fire,
c53745	and they shall be weary.
c53746	The word
c53747	which Jeremiah the prophet commanded Seraiah the son of Neriah, the son of Maaseiah,
c53748	when he went with Zedekiah the king of Judah into Babylon in the fourth year
c53749	of his reign.
c53750	And <i>this</i> Seraiah <i>was</i> a quiet prince.
c53751	So Jeremiah wrote in
c53753	a book all the evil that should come upon Babylon, <i>even</i> all these words
c53754	that are written against Babylon.
c53755	And Jeremiah said to Seraiah,
c53756	When thou comest to Babylon,
c53757	and shalt see,
c53758	and shalt read all these words;
c53759	Then shalt thou say,
c53760	O LORD,
c53761	thou hast spoken against this place,
c53762	to cut it off,
c53763	that none shall remain in it, neither man nor beast,
c53764	but that it shall be desolate for ever.
c53765	And it shall be,
c53766	when thou hast made an end
c53767	of reading this book,
c53768	<i>that</i> thou shalt bind a stone to
c53769	it, and cast it into the midst of Euphrates:
c53770	And thou shalt say,
c53771	Thus shall Babylon sink,
c53772	and shall not rise from the evil
c53773	that I will bring upon
c53774	her: and they shall be weary.
c53775	Thus far <i>are</i> the words of Jeremiah.
c53776	Zedekiah <i>was</i> one and twenty years old
c53777	when he began to reign,
c53778	and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem.
c53779	And his mother's name <i>was</i> Hamutal the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah.
c53780	And he did
c53781	<i>that which was</i> evil in the eyes of the LORD,
c53782	according to all
c53783	that Jehoiakim had done.
c53784	For through the anger of the LORD it came to pass in Jerusalem and Judah,
c53785	till he had cast them out from his presence,
c53786	that Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon.
c53787	And it came to pass in the ninth year
c53788	of his reign,
c53789	in the tenth month, in the tenth <i>day</i> of the month,
c53790	<i>that</i> Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon came, he and all his army, against Jerusalem,
c53791	and pitched against
c53792	it, and built forts against it round about.
c53793	So the city was besieged unto the eleventh year of king Zedekiah.
c53794	And in the fourth month, in the ninth <i>day</i> of the month,
c53795	the famine was sore in the city,
c53796	so that there was no bread for the people of the land.
c53797	Then the city was broken up,
c53798	and all the men of war fled,
c53799	and went forth out of the city by night by the way of the gate between the two walls,
c53800	which <i>was</i> by the king's garden;
c53801	(now the Chaldeans <i>were</i> by the city round about:)
c53802	and they went by the way of the plain.
c53803	But the army of the Chaldeans pursued after the king,
c53804	and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho;
c53805	and all his army was scattered from him.
c53806	Then they took the king,
c53807	and carried him up unto the king of Babylon to Riblah in the land of Hamath;
c53808	where he gave judgment upon him.
c53809	And the king of Babylon slew the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes:
c53810	he slew also all the princes of Judah in Riblah.
c53811	Then he put out the eyes of Zedekiah;
c53813	and the king of Babylon bound him in chains, and carried him to Babylon,
c53814	and put him in prison till the day of his death.
c53815	Now in the fifth month, in the tenth <i>day</i> of the month,
c53816	which <i>was</i> the nineteenth year of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, came Nebuzaradan, captain of the guard,
c53818	<i>which</i> served the king of Babylon,
c53819	into Jerusalem,
c53820	And burned the house of the LORD, and the king's house;
c53821	and all the houses of Jerusalem, and all the houses of the great <i>men,</i> burned he with fire:
c53822	And all the army of the Chaldeans, that <i>were</i> with the captain of the guard, brake down all the walls of Jerusalem round about.
c53825	that remained in the city,
c53826	and those that fell away,
c53827	that fell to the king of Babylon, and the rest of the multitude.
c53828	Then Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive <i>certain</i> of the poor of the people, and the residue of the people
c53829	But Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left <i>certain</i> of the poor of the land for vinedressers and for husbandmen.
c53830	Also the pillars of brass
c53831	that <i>were</i> in the house of the LORD,
c53832	and the bases, and the brasen sea
c53833	that <i>was</i> in the house of the LORD,
c53834	the Chaldeans brake,
c53835	and carried all the brass of them to Babylon.
c53836	The caldrons also, and the shovels, and the snuffers, and the bowls, and the spoons, and all the vessels of brass
c53837	wherewith they ministered,
c53838	took they away.
c53839	And the basons, and the firepans, and the bowls, and the caldrons, and the candlesticks, and the spoons, and the cups;
c53840	<i>that</i> which <i>was</i> of gold <i>in</i> gold,
c53841	and <i>that</i> which <i>was</i> of silver <i>in</i> silver,
c53842	took the captain of the guard away.
c53843	The two pillars, one sea, and twelve brasen bulls
c53844	that <i>were</i> under the bases,
c53845	which king Solomon had made in the house of the LORD:
c53846	the brass of all these vessels was without weight.
c53847	And <i>concerning</i> the pillars,
c53848	the height of one pillar <i>was</i> eighteen cubits;
c53849	and a fillet of twelve cubits did compass
c53850	it; and the thickness thereof <i>was</i> four fingers:
c53851	<i>it was</i> hollow.
c53852	And a chapiter of brass <i>was</i> upon
c53853	it; and the height of one chapiter <i>was</i> five cubits,
c53854	with network and pomegranates upon the chapiters round about,
c53855	all <i>of</i> brass.
c53856	The second pillar also and the pomegranates <i>were</i> like unto these.
c53857	And there were ninety and six pomegranates on a side;
c53858	<i>and</i> all the pomegranates upon the network <i>were</i> an hundred round about.
c53859	And the captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest, and Zephaniah the second priest, and the three keepers of the door:
c53860	He took also out of the city an eunuch,
c53861	which had the charge of the men of war; and seven men
c53862	of them that were near the king's person, which were found in the city;
c53864	and the principal scribe of the host,
c53865	who mustered the people of the land;
c53866	and threescore men of the people of the land,
c53867	that were found in the midst of the city.
c53868	So Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard took
c53869	them, and brought them to the king of Babylon to Riblah.
c53870	And the king of Babylon smote
c53871	them, and put them to death in Riblah in the land of Hamath.
c53872	Thus Judah was carried away captive out of his own land.
c53873	This <i>is</i> the people
c53874	whom Nebuchadrezzar carried away captive: in the seventh year
c53875	three thousand Jews and three and twenty:
c53876	In the eighteenth year of Nebuchadrezzar he carried away captive from Jerusalem eight hundred thirty and two persons:
c53877	In the three and twentieth year of Nebuchadrezzar Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive of the Jews seven hundred forty and five persons:
c53878	all the persons <i>were</i> four thousand and six hundred.
c53879	And it came to pass in the seven and thirtieth year of the captivity of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the twelfth month, in the five and twentieth <i>day</i> of the month,
c53880	<i>that</i> Evilmerodach king of Babylon in the <i>first</i> year of his reign lifted up the head of Jehoiachin king of Judah,
c53881	and brought him forth out of prison,
c53882	And spake kindly
c53884	unto him, and set his throne above the throne of the kings that <i>were</i> with him in Babylon,
c53885	And changed his prison garments:
c53886	and he did continually eat bread before him all the days of his life.
c53887	And <i>for</i> his diet,
c53888	there was a continual diet given him of the king of Babylon, every day a portion until the day of his death, all the days of his life.
c53889	Now it came to pass in the thirtieth year, in the fourth <i>month,</i> in the fifth <i>day</i> of the month,
c53890	as I <i>was</i> among the captives by the river of Chebar,
c53891	<i>that</i> the heavens were opened,
c53892	and I saw visions of God.
c53893	In the fifth <i>day</i> of the month,
c53894	which <i>was</i> the fifth year of king Jehoiachin's captivity,
c53895	The word of the LORD came expressly unto Ezekiel the priest, the son of Buzi, in the land of the Chaldeans by the river Chebar;
c53896	and the hand of the LORD was there upon him.
c53897	And I looked,
c53898	and, behold,
c53899	a whirlwind came out of the north,
c53900	a great cloud,
c53901	and a fire infolding itself,
c53902	and a brightness <i>was</i> about
c53903	it, and out of the midst thereof as the colour of amber, out of the midst of the fire.
c53904	Also out of the midst thereof <i>came</i> the likeness of four living creatures.
c53905	And this <i>was</i> their appearance;
c53906	they had the likeness of a man.
c53907	And every one had four faces,
c53908	and every one had four wings.
c53909	And their feet <i>were</i> straight feet;
c53910	and the sole of their feet <i>was</i> like the sole of a calf's foot:
c53911	and they sparkled like the colour of burnished brass.
c53912	And <i>they had</i> the hands of a man under their wings on their four sides;
c53913	and they four had their faces and their wings.
c53914	<i>were</i> joined
c53915	one to another;
c53916	Their wings
c53917	they turned not
c53918	when they went;
c53919	every one straight forward.
c53920	they went
c53921	As for the likeness of their faces, they four had the face of a man,
c53922	and the face of a lion, on the right side:
c53923	and they four had the face of an ox on the left side;
c53924	they four also had the face of an eagle.
c53925	Thus <i>were</i> their faces:
c53926	and their wings <i>were</i> stretched upward;
c53927	two <i>wings</i> of every one
c53928	<i>were</i> joined one to another,
c53929	and two covered their bodies.
c53931	every one straight forward:
c53932	And they went
c53933	whither the spirit was
c53934	to go,
c53935	they went;
c53936	<i>and</i> they turned not
c53937	when they went.
c53938	As for the likeness of the living creatures,
c53939	their appearance <i>was</i> like burning coals of fire,
c53940	<i>and</i> like the appearance of lamps:
c53941	it went up and down among the living creatures;
c53942	and the fire was bright,
c53943	and out of the fire went forth lightning.
c53944	And the living creatures
c53945	ran
c53946	and returned
c53947	as the appearance of a flash of lightning.
c53948	Now as I beheld the living creatures,
c53949	behold one wheel upon the earth by the living creatures, with his four faces.
c53950	The appearance of the wheels and their work <i>was</i> like unto the colour of a beryl:
c53951	and they four had one likeness:
c53952	and their appearance and their work
c53953	<i>was</i> as it were a wheel in the middle of a wheel.
c53954	upon their four sides:
c53955	When they went,
c53956	they went
c53957	<i>and</i> they turned not
c53958	when they went.
c53959	As for their rings,
c53960	they were so high
c53961	that they were dreadful;
c53962	and their rings <i>were</i> full of eyes round about them four.
c53963	And when the living creatures went,
c53964	the wheels went by
c53965	them: and when the living creatures were lifted up from the earth,
c53966	the wheels were lifted up.
c53967	Whithersoever the spirit was
c53968	to go,
c53969	they went,
c53970	thither <i>was their</i> spirit
c53971	to go;
c53972	and the wheels were lifted up over against
c53973	them: for the spirit of the living creature <i>was</i> in the wheels.
c53974	When those went,
c53975	<i>these</i> went;
c53976	and when those stood,
c53977	<i>these</i> stood;
c53978	and when those were lifted up from the earth,
c53979	the wheels were lifted up over against
c53980	them: for the spirit of the living creature <i>was</i> in the wheels.
c53981	And the likeness of the firmament upon the heads of the living creature <i>was</i> as the colour of the terrible crystal,
c53982	stretched forth over their heads above.
c53983	And under the firmament <i>were</i> their wings straight,
c53984	the one toward the other:
c53985	every one had two, which covered on this side,
c53986	and every one had two, which covered on that side, their bodies.
c53987	I heard the noise of their wings, like the noise of great waters, as the voice of the Almighty,
c53988	And when they went,
c53989	the voice of speech, as the noise of an host:
c53990	when they stood,
c53991	they let down their wings.
c53992	And there was a voice from the firmament
c53993	that <i>was</i> over their heads,
c53994	when they stood,
c53995	<i>and</i> had let down their wings.
c53996	And above the firmament
c53997	that <i>was</i> over their heads
c53998	<i>was</i> the likeness of a throne, as the appearance of a sapphire stone:
c53999	and upon the likeness of the throne <i>was</i> the likeness as the appearance of a man above upon it.
c54000	And I saw as the colour of amber,
c54001	as the appearance of fire
c54002	round about within
c54003	it, from the appearance of his loins even upward,
c54004	and from the appearance of his loins even downward,
c54005	I saw as it were the appearance of fire,
c54006	and it had brightness round about.
c54007	As the appearance of the bow
c54008	that is in the cloud in the day of rain,
c54009	so <i>was</i> the appearance of the brightness round about.
c54010	This <i>was</i> the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the LORD.
c54011	And when I saw
c54012	<i>it,</i> I fell upon my face,
c54013	and I heard a voice
c54014	of one that spake.
c54015	And he said unto
c54016	me, Son of man,
c54017	stand upon thy feet,
c54018	and I will speak unto thee.
c54019	And the spirit entered
c54020	into me when he spake unto
c54021	me, and set me upon my feet,
c54022	that I heard him that spake unto me.
c54023	And he said unto
c54024	me, Son of man,
c54025	I send thee to the children of Israel, to a rebellious nation
c54027	that hath rebelled
c54028	against me: they and their fathers have transgressed against me, <i>even</i> unto this very day.
c54029	For <i>they are</i> impudent children and stiffhearted.
c54030	I do send thee unto
c54031	them; and thou shalt say unto
c54032	them, Thus saith the Lord GOD.
c54033	And they,
c54034	whether they will hear,
c54035	or whether they will forbear,
c54036	(for they <i>are</i> a rebellious house,)
c54037	yet shall know
c54038	that there hath been a prophet among them.
c54039	And thou,
c54040	son of man,
c54041	be not afraid of them, neither be afraid of their words,
c54043	though briers and thorns <i>be</i> with
c54044	thee, and thou dost dwell among scorpions:
c54045	be not afraid
c54046	of their words, nor be dismayed at their looks,
c54047	though they <i>be</i> a rebellious house.
c54048	And thou shalt speak my words unto
c54049	them, whether they will hear,
c54050	or whether they will forbear:
c54051	for they <i>are</i> most rebellious.
c54052	But thou,
c54053	son of man,
c54054	hear
c54055	what I say unto
c54056	thee; Be not thou rebellious like that rebellious house:
c54057	open thy mouth,
c54058	and eat
c54059	that I give thee.
c54060	And when I looked,
c54061	behold,
c54062	an hand <i>was</i> sent unto
c54063	me; and, lo,
c54064	a roll of a book <i>was</i> therein;
c54065	And he spread it before
c54066	me; and it <i>was</i> written within and without:
c54067	and <i>there was</i> written therein lamentations, and mourning, and woe.
c54068	Moreover he said unto
c54069	me, Son of man,
c54070	that thou findest;
c54071	eat
c54072	eat this roll,
c54073	and go
c54074	speak unto the house of Israel.
c54075	So I opened my mouth,
c54076	and he caused me to eat that roll.
c54077	And he said unto
c54078	me, Son of man,
c54079	cause thy belly to eat,
c54080	and fill thy bowels with this roll
c54081	that I give
c54082	thee. Then did I eat
c54083	<i>it;</i> and it was in my mouth as honey for sweetness.
c54084	And he said unto
c54085	me, Son of man,
c54086	go,
c54087	get thee unto the house of Israel,
c54088	and speak with my words unto them.
c54089	For thou <i>art</i> not sent to a people of a strange speech and of an hard language,
c54090	<i>but</i> to the house of Israel;
c54091	Not to many people of a strange speech and of an hard language,
c54092	whose words thou canst not understand.
c54093	Surely, had I sent thee to
c54094	them, they would have hearkened unto thee.
c54095	But the house of Israel will not
c54096	hearken unto
c54097	thee; for they will not
c54098	hearken unto
c54099	me: for all the house of Israel
c54100	<i>are</i> impudent and hardhearted.
c54101	Behold, I have made thy face strong against their faces,
c54102	and thy forehead strong against their foreheads.
c54103	As an adamant harder than flint have I made thy forehead:
c54104	fear them not,
c54105	neither be dismayed at their looks,
c54106	though they <i>be</i> a rebellious house.
c54107	Moreover he said unto
c54108	me, Son of man,
c54109	all my words
c54110	that I shall speak unto
c54111	thee receive in thine heart,
c54112	and hear with thine ears.
c54113	And go,
c54114	get thee to them of the captivity, unto the children of thy people,
c54115	and speak unto
c54116	them, and tell
c54117	them, Thus saith the Lord GOD;
c54118	whether they will hear,
c54119	or whether they will forbear.
c54120	Then the spirit took me up,
c54121	and I heard behind me a voice of a great rushing,
c54122	<i>saying,</i> Blessed <i>be</i> the glory of the LORD from his place.
c54123	<i>I heard</i> also the noise of the wings of the living creatures
c54124	that touched
c54125	one another,
c54126	and the noise of the wheels over against
c54127	them, and a noise of a great rushing.
c54128	So the spirit lifted me up,
c54129	and took me away,
c54130	and I went in bitterness, in the heat of my spirit;
c54131	but the hand of the LORD was strong upon me.
c54132	Then I came to them of the captivity at Telabib,
c54133	that dwelt by the river of Chebar,
c54135	and I sat where they
c54136	sat, and remained there astonished among them seven days.
c54137	And it came to pass at the end of seven days,
c54138	that the word of the LORD came unto
c54139	me, saying,
c54140	Son of man,
c54141	I have made thee a watchman unto the house of Israel:
c54142	therefore hear the word at my mouth,
c54143	and give them warning from me.
c54144	When I say unto the wicked,
c54145	Thou shalt surely die;
c54146	and thou givest him not warning,
c54147	nor speakest
c54148	to warn the wicked from his wicked way,
c54149	to save his life;
c54150	the same wicked <i>man</i> shall die in his iniquity;
c54151	but his blood will I require at thine hand.
c54153	Yet if thou warn the wicked,
c54154	and he turn not from his wickedness, nor from his wicked way,
c54155	he shall die in his iniquity;
c54156	but thou hast delivered thy soul.
c54158	Again, When a righteous <i>man</i> doth turn from his righteousness,
c54159	and commit iniquity,
c54160	and I lay a stumblingblock before
c54161	him, he shall die:
c54162	because thou hast not given him warning,
c54163	he shall die in his sin,
c54164	and his righteousness which he hath done shall not be remembered;
c54166	but his blood will I require at thine hand.
c54168	Nevertheless if thou warn the righteous
c54169	<i>man,</i> that the righteous sin not,
c54170	and he doth not sin,
c54171	he shall surely live,
c54172	because he is warned;
c54173	also thou hast delivered thy soul.
c54174	And the hand of the LORD was there upon
c54175	me; and he said unto
c54176	me, Arise,
c54177	go forth into the plain,
c54178	and I will there talk with thee.
c54179	Then I arose,
c54180	and went forth into the plain:
c54181	and, behold, the glory of the LORD stood there, as the glory
c54182	which I saw by the river of Chebar:
c54183	and I fell on my face.
c54184	Then the spirit entered
c54185	into me, and set me upon my feet,
c54186	and spake with
c54187	me, and said unto
c54188	me, Go,
c54189	shut thyself within thine house.
c54190	But thou,
c54191	O son of man,
c54192	behold, they shall put bands upon
c54193	thee, and shall bind
c54194	thee with them, and thou shalt not go out among them:
c54195	And I will make thy tongue cleave to the roof of thy mouth,
c54196	that thou shalt be dumb,
c54197	and shalt not be to them a reprover:
c54199	for they <i>are</i> a rebellious house.
c54201	But when I speak with
c54202	thee, I will open thy mouth,
c54203	and thou shalt say unto
c54204	them, Thus saith the Lord GOD;
c54205	He that heareth,
c54206	let him hear;
c54207	and he that forbeareth, let him forbear:
c54208	for they <i>are</i> a rebellious house.
c54209	Thou
c54210	also, son of man,
c54211	take thee a tile,
c54212	and lay it before
c54213	thee, and pourtray upon it the city, <i>even</i> Jerusalem:
c54214	And lay siege against
c54215	it, and build a fort against
c54216	it, and cast a mount against
c54217	it; set the camp also against
c54218	it, and set <i>battering</i> rams against it round about.
c54220	Moreover take thou unto thee an iron pan,
c54221	and set it <i>for</i> a wall of iron between thee and the city:
c54222	and set thy face against
c54223	it, and it shall be besieged,
c54224	and thou shalt lay siege against
c54225	it. This <i>shall be</i> a sign to the house of Israel.
c54227	Lie thou also upon thy left side,
c54228	and lay the iniquity of the house of Israel upon
c54229	it: <i>according</i> to the number of the days
c54230	that thou shalt lie upon
c54231	it thou shalt bear their iniquity.
c54232	For I have laid upon thee the years of their iniquity, according to the number of the days, three hundred and ninety days:
c54233	so shalt thou bear the iniquity of the house of Israel.
c54234	And when thou hast accomplished them,
c54235	lie again on thy right side,
c54236	and thou shalt bear the iniquity of the house of Judah forty days:
c54237	thee each day for a year.
c54238	I have appointed
c54239	Therefore thou shalt set thy face toward the siege of Jerusalem,
c54240	and thine arm <i>shall be</i> uncovered,
c54241	and thou shalt prophesy against it.
c54242	And, behold, I will lay bands upon
c54243	thee, and thou shalt not turn thee from one side to another,
c54244	till thou hast ended the days of thy siege.
c54246	Take thou also unto thee wheat, and barley, and beans, and lentiles, and millet, and fitches,
c54247	and put them in one vessel,
c54248	and make thee bread
c54249	thereof, <i>according</i> to the number of the days
c54250	that thou shalt lie upon thy side,
c54251	three hundred and ninety days shalt thou eat thereof.
c54252	And thy meat
c54253	which thou shalt eat
c54254	<i>shall be</i> by weight,
c54255	twenty shekels a day:
c54256	from time to time shalt thou eat it.
c54257	Thou shalt drink also water by measure,
c54258	the sixth part of an hin:
c54259	from time to time shalt thou drink.
c54260	it <i>as</i> barley cakes,
c54261	And thou shalt eat
c54263	and thou shalt bake it with dung that cometh out of man, in their sight.
c54264	And the LORD said,
c54265	Even thus shall the children of Israel eat their defiled bread among the Gentiles,
c54266	whither I will drive them.
c54267	Then said
c54268	I, Ah Lord GOD!
c54269	behold, my soul hath not been polluted:
c54270	for from my youth up even till now have I not eaten of that which dieth of itself, or is torn in pieces;
c54271	neither came there abominable flesh into my mouth.
c54272	Then he said unto
c54273	me, Lo,
c54274	I have given thee cow's dung for man's dung,
c54275	and thou shalt prepare thy bread therewith.
c54276	Moreover he said unto
c54277	me, Son of man,
c54278	behold, I will break the staff of bread in Jerusalem:
c54279	and they shall eat bread by weight, and with care;
c54280	and they shall drink water by measure, and with astonishment:
c54281	That they may want bread and water,
c54282	and be astonied one with another,
c54283	and consume away for their iniquity.
c54284	And thou,
c54285	son of man,
c54286	take thee a sharp knife,
c54287	thee a barber's razor,
c54288	take
c54289	and cause <i>it</i> to pass upon thine head and upon thy beard:
c54290	then take thee balances to weigh,
c54291	and divide the <i>hair.</i>
c54292	Thou shalt burn with fire a third part in the midst of the city,
c54293	when the days of the siege are fulfilled:
c54294	and thou shalt take a third part,
c54295	<i>and</i> smite about it with a knife:
c54296	and a third part thou shalt scatter in the wind;
c54297	and I will draw out a sword after them.
c54298	Thou shalt also take thereof a few in number,
c54299	and bind them in thy skirts.
c54300	Then take of them again, and cast them into the midst of the fire,
c54302	and burn them in the fire; <i>for</i> thereof
c54303	shall a fire come forth into all the house of Israel.
c54304	Thus saith the Lord GOD;
c54305	This <i>is</i> Jerusalem:
c54306	I have set it in the midst of the nations
c54307	and countries <i>that are</i> round about her.
c54308	And she hath changed my judgments into wickedness more than the nations,
c54309	and my statutes more than the countries
c54310	that <i>are</i> round about
c54311	her: for they have refused my judgments
c54312	and my statutes,
c54313	they have not walked in them.
c54314	Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD;
c54315	Because ye multiplied more than the nations
c54316	that <i>are</i> round about
c54317	you, <i>and</i> have not walked in my statutes,
c54318	neither have kept my judgments,
c54319	according to the judgments of the nations
c54320	that <i>are</i> round about you;
c54321	neither have done
c54322	Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD;
c54323	Behold, I, even I, <i>am</i> against
c54325	thee, and will execute judgments in the midst of thee in the sight of the nations.
c54326	And I will do
c54327	in thee that which I have not done,
c54328	and whereunto I will not do any more the like,
c54329	because of all thine abominations.
c54330	Therefore the fathers shall eat the sons in the midst
c54331	of thee, and the sons shall eat their fathers;
c54332	and I will execute judgments
c54333	in thee, and the whole remnant of thee will I scatter into all the winds.
c54334	Wherefore,
c54335	<i>as</i> I live,
c54336	saith the Lord GOD;
c54337	Surely,
c54338	because thou hast defiled my sanctuary with all thy detestable things, and with all thine abominations,
c54339	therefore will I also diminish
c54340	<i>thee;</i> neither shall mine eye spare,
c54341	neither will I have any pity.
c54342	A third part of thee shall die with the pestilence,
c54343	and with famine shall they be consumed in the midst
c54344	of thee: and a third part shall fall by the sword round about
c54345	thee; and I will scatter a third part into all the winds,
c54346	and I will draw out a sword after them.
c54347	Thus shall mine anger be accomplished,
c54348	and I will cause my fury to rest
c54349	upon them, and I will be comforted:
c54350	and they shall know
c54351	that I the LORD have spoken <i>it</i> in my zeal,
c54352	when I have accomplished my fury in them.
c54353	Moreover I will make thee waste, and a reproach among the nations
c54354	that <i>are</i> round about
c54355	thee, in the sight of all that pass by.
c54356	So it shall be a reproach and a taunt, an instruction and an astonishment unto the nations
c54357	that <i>are</i> round about
c54358	thee, when I shall execute judgments in thee in anger and in fury and in furious rebukes.
c54359	I the LORD have spoken <i>it.</i>
c54360	When I shall send upon them the evil arrows of famine,
c54361	which shall be for <i>their</i> destruction,
c54362	<i>and</i> which I will send
c54363	to destroy
c54364	you: and I will increase the famine upon
c54365	you, and will break your staff of bread:
c54366	So will I send upon you famine and evil beasts,
c54367	and they shall bereave
c54368	thee; and pestilence and blood shall pass
c54369	through thee; and I will bring the sword upon
c54370	thee. I the LORD have spoken <i>it.</i>
c54371	And the word of the LORD came unto
c54372	me, saying,
c54373	Son of man,
c54374	set thy face toward the mountains of Israel,
c54375	and prophesy against them,
c54376	And say,
c54377	Ye mountains of Israel,
c54378	hear the word of the Lord GOD;
c54379	Thus saith the Lord GOD to the mountains, and to the hills, to the rivers, and to the valleys;
c54380	Behold,
c54381	I, <i>even</i> I, will bring a sword upon
c54382	you, and I will destroy your high places.
c54383	And your altars shall be desolate,
c54384	and your images shall be broken:
c54385	and I will cast down your slain <i>men</i> before your idols.
c54386	And I will lay the dead carcases of the children of Israel before their idols;
c54387	and I will scatter your bones round about your altars.
c54388	In all your dwellingplaces the cities shall be laid waste,
c54389	and the high places shall be desolate;
c54390	that your altars may be laid waste
c54391	and made desolate,
c54393	and your idols may be broken and cease,
c54394	and your images may be cut down,
c54395	and your works may be abolished.
c54396	And the slain shall fall in the midst
c54397	of you, and ye shall know
c54398	that I <i>am</i> the LORD.
c54399	Yet will I leave a remnant,
c54400	that ye may have <i>some</i> that shall escape the sword among the nations,
c54401	when ye shall be scattered through the countries.
c54402	And they that escape of you shall remember me among the nations whither they shall be carried captives,
c54404	because I am broken with their whorish heart,
c54405	which hath departed from me, and with
c54406	their eyes,
c54407	which go a whoring after their idols:
c54408	and they shall lothe themselves for the evils
c54409	which they have committed in all their abominations.
c54410	And they shall know
c54411	that I <i>am</i> the LORD,
c54412	<i>and that</i> I have not said in vain
c54413	that I would do this evil unto them.
c54414	Thus saith the Lord GOD;
c54415	Smite with thine hand,
c54416	and stamp with thy foot,
c54417	and say,
c54418	Alas
c54419	for all the evil abominations of the house of Israel!
c54420	for they shall fall by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence.
c54421	He that is far off shall die of the pestilence;
c54422	and he that is near shall fall by the sword;
c54423	and he that remaineth and is besieged shall die by the famine:
c54424	thus will I accomplish my fury upon them.
c54425	Then shall ye know
c54426	that I <i>am</i> the LORD,
c54427	when their slain <i>men</i> shall be among their idols round about their altars, upon every high hill, in all the tops of the mountains, and under every green tree, and under every thick oak,
c54428	the place
c54429	where they did offer sweet savour to all their idols.
c54430	So will I stretch out my hand upon
c54431	them, and make the land desolate, yea, more desolate than the wilderness toward Diblath, in all their habitations:
c54432	and they shall know
c54433	that I <i>am</i> the LORD.
c54434	Moreover the word of the LORD came unto
c54435	me, saying,
c54436	Also, thou
c54437	son of man,
c54438	thus saith the Lord GOD unto the land of Israel;
c54439	An end,
c54440	the end is come upon the four corners of the land.
c54441	Now <i>is</i> the end <i>come</i> upon
c54442	thee, and I will send mine anger
c54443	upon thee, and will judge thee according to thy ways,
c54444	and will recompense upon thee all thine abominations.
c54445	And mine eye shall not spare
c54446	thee, neither will I have pity:
c54447	but I will recompense thy ways upon
c54448	thee, and thine abominations shall be in the midst
c54449	of thee: and ye shall know
c54450	that I <i>am</i> the LORD.
c54451	Thus saith the Lord GOD;
c54452	An evil, an only evil,
c54453	behold, is come.
c54454	An end is come,
c54455	the end is come:
c54456	it watcheth for
c54457	thee; behold, it is come.
c54458	The morning is come unto
c54459	thee, O thou that dwellest in the land:
c54460	the time is come,
c54461	the day of trouble <i>is</i> near,
c54463	and not the sounding again of the mountains.
c54464	Now will I shortly pour out my fury upon
c54465	thee, and accomplish mine anger
c54466	upon thee: and I will judge thee according to thy ways,
c54467	and will recompense thee for all thine abominations.
c54468	And mine eye shall not spare,
c54469	neither will I have pity:
c54470	I will recompense thee according to thy ways
c54471	and thine abominations <i>that</i> are in the midst
c54472	of thee; and ye shall know
c54473	that I <i>am</i> the LORD that smiteth.
c54474	Behold the day,
c54475	behold, it is come:
c54476	the morning is gone forth;
c54477	the rod hath blossomed,
c54478	pride hath budded.
c54479	Violence is risen up into a rod of wickedness:
c54480	none
c54481	of them <i>shall remain,</i> nor
c54482	of their multitude, nor of any of theirs:
c54483	neither <i>shall there be</i> wailing for them.
c54484	The time is come,
c54485	the day draweth near:
c54486	let not the buyer rejoice,
c54487	nor the seller mourn:
c54488	for wrath <i>is</i> upon all the multitude thereof.
c54489	For the seller shall not return to that which is sold,
c54490	although they were yet alive:
c54491	for the vision <i>is</i> touching the whole multitude thereof, <i>which</i> shall not return;
c54493	in the iniquity of his life.
c54494	neither shall any strengthen himself
c54495	They have blown the trumpet,
c54496	even to make all ready;
c54497	but none goeth to the battle:
c54498	for my wrath <i>is</i> upon all the multitude thereof.
c54499	The sword <i>is</i> without,
c54500	and the pestilence and the famine within:
c54501	he that <i>is</i> in the field
c54502	shall die with the sword;
c54503	and he that <i>is</i> in the city,
c54504	famine and pestilence shall devour him.
c54505	But they that escape of them shall escape,
c54506	and shall be on the mountains like doves of the valleys,
c54507	all of them mourning,
c54508	every one for his iniquity.
c54509	All hands shall be feeble,
c54510	and all knees shall be weak <i>as</i> water.
c54511	They shall also gird <i>themselves</i> with sackcloth,
c54512	and horror shall cover
c54513	them; and shame <i>shall be</i> upon all faces,
c54514	and baldness upon all their heads.
c54515	They shall cast their silver in the streets,
c54516	and their gold shall be removed:
c54517	their silver and their gold shall not be able
c54518	to deliver them in the day of the wrath of the LORD:
c54519	they shall not satisfy their souls,
c54520	neither fill their bowels:
c54521	because it is the stumblingblock of their iniquity.
c54522	As for the beauty of his ornament,
c54523	he set it in majesty:
c54524	but they made the images of their abominations <i>and</i> of their detestable things
c54525	therein: therefore have I set it far from them.
c54526	And I will give it into the hands of the strangers for a prey,
c54527	and to the wicked of the earth for a spoil;
c54528	and they shall pollute it.
c54529	My face will I turn also from
c54530	them, and they shall pollute my secret
c54531	<i>place:</i> for the robbers shall enter
c54532	into it, and defile it.
c54533	Make a chain:
c54534	for the land is full of bloody crimes,
c54535	and the city is full of violence.
c54536	Wherefore I will bring the worst of the heathen,
c54537	and they shall possess their houses:
c54538	I will also make the pomp of the strong to cease;
c54539	and their holy places shall be defiled.
c54540	Destruction cometh;
c54541	and they shall seek peace,
c54542	and <i>there shall be</i> none.
c54543	Mischief shall come upon mischief,
c54544	and rumour shall be upon rumour;
c54545	then shall they seek a vision of the prophet;
c54546	but the law shall perish from the priest,
c54547	and counsel from the ancients.
c54548	The king shall mourn,
c54549	and the prince shall be clothed with desolation,
c54550	and the hands of the people of the land shall be troubled:
c54551	I will do unto them after their way,
c54552	and according to their deserts will I judge
c54553	them; and they shall know
c54554	that I <i>am</i> the LORD.
c54555	And it came to pass in the sixth year, in the sixth <i>month,</i> in the fifth <i>day</i> of the month,
c54556	<i>as</i> I sat in mine house,
c54557	and the elders of Judah sat before
c54558	me, that the hand of the Lord GOD fell there upon me.
c54559	Then I beheld,
c54560	and lo a likeness as the appearance of fire:
c54561	from the appearance of his loins even downward, fire;
c54562	and from his loins even upward, as the appearance of brightness, as the colour of amber.
c54563	And he put forth the form of an hand,
c54564	and took me by a lock of mine head;
c54565	and the spirit lifted me up between the earth and the heaven,
c54566	and brought me in the visions of God to Jerusalem, to the door of the inner gate
c54567	that looketh toward the north;
c54568	where <i>was</i> the seat of the image of jealousy,
c54569	which provoketh to jealousy.
c54570	And, behold, the glory of the God of Israel <i>was</i> there,
c54571	according to the vision
c54572	that I saw in the plain.
c54573	Then said he unto
c54574	me, Son of man,
c54575	lift up thine eyes now the way toward the north.
c54576	So I lifted up mine eyes the way toward the north,
c54577	and behold northward at the gate of the altar this image of jealousy in the entry.
c54578	He said furthermore unto
c54579	me, Son of man,
c54580	seest thou
c54581	what they do?
c54582	<i>even</i> the great abominations
c54583	that the house of Israel committeth here,
c54584	that I should go far off from my sanctuary?
c54585	but turn thee yet again,
c54586	<i>and</i> thou shalt see greater abominations.
c54587	And he brought me to the door of the court;
c54588	and when I looked,
c54589	behold a hole in the wall.
c54590	Then said he unto
c54591	me, Son of man,
c54592	dig now in the wall:
c54593	and when I had digged in the wall,
c54594	behold a door.
c54595	And he said unto
c54596	me, Go in,
c54597	and behold the wicked abominations
c54598	that they do here.
c54599	So I went in
c54600	and saw;
c54601	and behold every form of creeping things, and abominable beasts, and all the idols of the house of Israel, pourtrayed upon the wall round about.
c54603	And there stood before them seventy men of the ancients of the house of Israel, and in the midst
c54604	of them stood Jaazaniah the son of Shaphan,
c54605	with every man
c54606	his censer in his hand;
c54607	and a thick cloud of incense went up.
c54608	Then said he unto
c54609	hast thou seen
c54610	me, Son of man,
c54611	what the ancients of the house of Israel do in the dark,
c54612	every man in the chambers of his imagery?
c54613	for they say,
c54614	The LORD seeth us not;
c54615	the LORD hath forsaken the earth.
c54616	He said also unto
c54617	me, Turn thee yet again,
c54618	<i>and</i> thou shalt see greater abominations
c54619	that they do.
c54620	Then he brought me to the door of the gate of the LORD'S house which <i>was</i> toward the north;
c54622	and, behold, there sat women
c54623	weeping for Tammuz.
c54624	Then said he unto
c54625	me, Hast thou seen
c54626	<i>this,</i> O son of man?
c54627	turn thee yet again,
c54628	<i>and</i> thou shalt see greater abominations than these.
c54629	And he brought me into the inner court of the LORD'S house,
c54630	and, behold, at the door of the temple of the LORD, between the porch and the altar, <i>were</i> about five and twenty men,
c54631	with their backs toward the temple of the LORD,
c54632	and their faces toward the east;
c54633	and they worshipped the sun toward the east.
c54634	Then he said unto
c54635	me, Hast thou seen
c54636	<i>this,</i> O son of man?
c54637	Is it a light thing to the house of Judah
c54638	that they commit the abominations
c54639	which they commit here?
c54640	for they have filled the land with violence,
c54641	and have returned
c54642	to provoke me to anger:
c54643	and, lo, they put the branch to their nose.
c54644	Therefore will I also deal in fury:
c54645	mine eye shall not spare,
c54646	neither will I have pity:
c54647	and though they cry in mine ears with a loud voice,
c54648	<i>yet</i> will I not hear them.
c54649	He cried also in mine ears with a loud voice,
c54650	saying,
c54651	to draw near,
c54652	Cause them that have charge over the city
c54653	even every man
c54654	<i>with</i> his destroying weapon in his hand.
c54655	And, behold,
c54656	six men came from the way of the higher gate,
c54657	which lieth toward the north,
c54658	and every man
c54659	a slaughter weapon in his hand;
c54660	and one man among them <i>was</i> clothed with linen,
c54661	with a writer's inkhorn by his side:
c54662	and they went in,
c54663	and stood beside the brasen altar.
c54664	And the glory of the God of Israel was gone up from the cherub,
c54665	whereupon he was,
c54666	to the threshold of the house.
c54667	And he called to the man
c54668	clothed with linen,
c54669	which <i>had</i> the writer's inkhorn by his side;
c54670	And the LORD said unto
c54671	him, Go through the midst of the city, through the midst of Jerusalem,
c54672	and set a mark upon the foreheads of the men
c54673	that sigh
c54674	and that cry for all the abominations
c54675	that be done in the midst thereof.
c54676	And to the others he said in mine hearing,
c54677	Go ye after him through the city,
c54678	and smite:
c54679	let not your eye spare,
c54680	neither have ye pity:
c54681	Slay utterly old <i>and</i> young, both maids, and little children, and women:
c54682	but come not near any man
c54683	upon whom <i>is</i> the mark;
c54685	and begin at my sanctuary.
c54686	Then they began at the ancient men
c54687	which <i>were</i> before the house.
c54688	And he said unto
c54689	them, Defile the house,
c54690	and fill the courts with the slain:
c54691	go ye forth.
c54692	And they went forth,
c54693	and slew in the city.
c54694	And it came to pass,
c54695	while they were slaying
c54696	them, and I was left,
c54697	that I fell upon my face,
c54698	and cried,
c54699	and said,
c54700	Ah Lord GOD!
c54701	wilt thou destroy all the residue of Israel
c54702	in thy pouring out of thy fury upon Jerusalem?
c54703	Then said he unto
c54704	me, The iniquity of the house of Israel and Judah <i>is</i> exceeding great,
c54705	and the land is full of blood,
c54706	and the city full of perverseness:
c54707	for they say,
c54708	The LORD hath forsaken the earth,
c54709	and the LORD seeth not.
c54710	And as for me also,
c54711	mine eye shall not spare,
c54712	neither will I have pity,
c54713	<i>but</i> I will recompense their way upon their head.
c54714	And, behold,
c54715	the man clothed with linen,
c54716	which <i>had</i> the inkhorn by his side,
c54717	reported the matter,
c54718	saying,
c54719	I have done
c54720	as thou hast commanded me.
c54721	Then I looked,
c54722	and, behold,
c54723	in the firmament
c54724	that was above the head of the cherubims
c54725	there appeared over them as it were a sapphire stone, as the appearance of the likeness of a throne.
c54726	And he spake unto the man clothed with linen,
c54727	and said,
c54728	Go in between the wheels, <i>even</i> under the cherub,
c54729	and fill thine hand with coals of fire from between the cherubims,
c54730	and scatter <i>them</i> over the city.
c54731	And he went in in my sight.
c54732	Now the cherubims stood on the right side of the house,
c54733	when the man went in;
c54734	and the cloud filled the inner court.
c54735	Then the glory of the LORD went up from the cherub, <i>and stood</i> over the threshold of the house;
c54736	and the house was filled with the cloud,
c54737	and the court was full of the brightness of the LORD'S glory.
c54738	And the sound of the cherubims' wings was heard <i>even</i> to the outer court, as the voice of the Almighty God
c54739	when he speaketh.
c54740	And it came to pass,
c54741	<i>that</i> when he had commanded the man clothed with linen,
c54742	saying,
c54743	Take fire from between the wheels, from between the cherubims;
c54744	then he went in,
c54745	and stood beside the wheels.
c54746	And <i>one</i> cherub stretched forth his hand from between the cherubims unto the fire
c54747	that <i>was</i> between the cherubims,
c54748	and took
c54749	<i>thereof,</i> and put <i>it</i> into the hands of <i>him that was</i> clothed with linen:
c54750	who took
c54751	<i>it,</i> and went out.
c54752	And there appeared in the cherubims the form of a man's hand under their wings.
c54753	And when I looked,
c54754	behold
c54755	the four wheels by the cherubims,
c54756	one wheel by one cherub,
c54757	and another wheel by another cherub:
c54758	and the appearance of the wheels <i>was</i> as the colour of a beryl stone.
c54759	And <i>as for</i> their appearances,
c54760	they four had one likeness,
c54761	as if a wheel had been in the midst of a wheel.
c54762	When they went,
c54763	they went upon their four sides;
c54764	they turned not
c54765	as they went,
c54766	but to the place
c54767	whither the head looked
c54768	they followed
c54769	it; they turned not
c54770	as they went.
c54771	And their whole body, and their backs, and their hands, and their wings, and the wheels, <i>were</i> full of eyes round about,
c54772	<i>even</i> the wheels that they four had.
c54773	As for the wheels,
c54774	it was cried unto them in my hearing, O wheel.
c54775	And every one had four faces:
c54776	the first face <i>was</i> the face of a cherub,
c54777	and the second face <i>was</i> the face of a man,
c54778	and the third the face of a lion,
c54779	and the fourth the face of an eagle.
c54780	And the cherubims were lifted up.
c54781	This <i>is</i> the living creature
c54782	that I saw by the river of Chebar.
c54784	And when the cherubims went,
c54785	the wheels went by
c54787	them: and when the cherubims lifted up their wings
c54788	to mount up from the earth,
c54789	the same wheels also turned not from beside them.
c54790	When they stood,
c54791	<i>these</i> stood;
c54793	and when they were lifted up,
c54794	<i>these</i> lifted up
c54795	themselves <i>also:</i> for the spirit of the living creature <i>was</i> in them.
c54796	Then the glory of the LORD departed from off the threshold of the house,
c54797	and stood over the cherubims.
c54798	And the cherubims lifted up their wings,
c54799	and mounted up from the earth in my sight:
c54800	when they went out,
c54801	the wheels also <i>were</i> beside
c54802	them, and <i>every one</i> stood at the door of the east gate of the LORD'S house;
c54803	and the glory of the God of Israel <i>was</i> over them above.
c54804	This <i>is</i> the living creature
c54805	that I saw under the God of Israel by the river of Chebar;
c54806	and I knew
c54807	that they <i>were</i> the cherubims.
c54808	Every one had four faces apiece,
c54809	and every one four wings;
c54810	and the likeness of the hands of a man <i>was</i> under their wings.
c54811	And the likeness of their faces
c54812	<i>was</i> the same faces
c54813	which I saw by the river of Chebar, their appearances
c54814	every one straight forward.
c54815	and themselves: they went
c54816	Moreover the spirit lifted me up,
c54817	and brought me unto the east gate of the LORD'S house,
c54818	which looketh eastward:
c54819	and behold
c54820	at the door of the gate five and twenty men;
c54821	among whom I saw Jaazaniah the son of Azur, and Pelatiah the son of Benaiah, princes of the people.
c54822	Then said he unto
c54823	me, Son of man,
c54824	these <i>are</i> the men
c54825	that devise mischief,
c54826	and give wicked counsel in this city:
c54827	Which say,
c54828	<i>It is</i> not near;
c54829	let us build houses:
c54830	this <i>city is</i> the caldron,
c54831	and we <i>be</i> the flesh.
c54832	Therefore
c54833	prophesy against
c54834	them, prophesy,
c54835	O son of man.
c54836	And the Spirit of the LORD fell upon
c54837	me, and said unto
c54838	me, Speak;
c54839	Thus saith the LORD;
c54840	Thus have ye said,
c54841	O house of Israel:
c54842	for I know the things that come into your mind, <i>every one of</i> them.
c54843	Ye have multiplied your slain in this city,
c54844	and ye have filled the streets thereof with the slain.
c54845	Therefore
c54846	thus saith the Lord GOD;
c54847	Your slain
c54848	whom ye have laid in the midst
c54849	of it, they <i>are</i> the flesh,
c54850	and this <i>city is</i> the caldron:
c54851	but I will bring you forth out of the midst of it.
c54852	Ye have feared the sword;
c54853	and I will bring a sword upon
c54854	you, saith the Lord GOD.
c54855	And I will bring you out of the midst
c54856	thereof, and deliver you into the hands of strangers,
c54857	and will execute judgments among you.
c54858	Ye shall fall by the sword;
c54859	I will judge you in the border of Israel;
c54860	and ye shall know
c54861	that I <i>am</i> the LORD.
c54862	This <i>city</i> shall not be your caldron,
c54863	neither shall ye be the flesh in the midst
c54864	thereof; <i>but</i> I will judge you in the border of Israel:
c54865	And ye shall know
c54866	that I <i>am</i> the LORD:
c54867	for ye have not walked in my statutes,
c54868	neither executed my judgments,
c54869	after the manners of the heathen
c54870	that <i>are</i> round about you.
c54871	but have done
c54872	And it came to pass,
c54873	when I prophesied,
c54874	that Pelatiah the son of Benaiah died.
c54875	Then fell I down upon my face,
c54876	and cried with a loud voice,
c54877	and said,
c54878	Ah Lord GOD!
c54879	wilt thou make a full end of the remnant of Israel?
c54880	Again the word of the LORD came unto
c54881	me, saying,
c54882	Son of man,
c54883	thy brethren, <i>even</i> thy brethren, the men of thy kindred, and all the house of Israel wholly,
c54884	<i>are</i> they unto whom the inhabitants of Jerusalem have said,
c54885	Get you far from the LORD:
c54886	unto us is this
c54887	land given in possession.
c54888	Therefore
c54889	say,
c54890	Thus saith the Lord GOD;
c54891	Although I have cast them far off among the heathen,
c54892	and although I have scattered them among the countries,
c54893	yet will I be to them as a little sanctuary in the countries
c54894	where they shall come.
c54895	Therefore
c54896	say,
c54897	Thus saith the Lord GOD;
c54898	I will even gather you from the people,
c54899	and assemble you out of the countries
c54900	where ye have been scattered,
c54901	and I will give you the land of Israel.
c54902	And they shall come thither,
c54903	and they shall take away all the detestable things thereof and all the abominations thereof from thence.
c54904	And I will give them one heart,
c54905	and I will put a new spirit within
c54906	you; and I will take the stony heart out of their flesh,
c54907	and will give them an heart of flesh:
c54908	That they may walk in my statutes,
c54909	and keep mine ordinances,
c54910	and do
c54911	them: and they shall be my people,
c54912	and I will be their God.
c54913	But <i>as for them</i> whose heart walketh after the heart of their detestable things and their abominations,
c54914	I will recompense their way upon their own heads,
c54915	saith the Lord GOD.
c54916	Then did the cherubims lift up their wings,
c54917	and the wheels beside
c54918	them; and the glory of the God of Israel <i>was</i> over them above.
c54919	And the glory of the LORD went up from the midst of the city,
c54920	and stood upon the mountain
c54921	which <i>is</i> on the east side of the city.
c54922	Afterwards the spirit took me up,
c54923	and brought me in a vision by the Spirit of God into Chaldea, to them of the captivity.
c54924	So the vision that I had seen went up from me.
c54926	Then I spake unto them of the captivity all the things that the LORD
c54927	had shewed me.
c54928	The word of the LORD also came unto
c54929	me, saying,
c54930	Son of man,
c54931	thou dwellest in the midst of a rebellious house,
c54932	which have eyes
c54933	to see,
c54934	and see not;
c54935	they have ears
c54936	to hear,
c54937	and hear not:
c54938	for they <i>are</i> a rebellious house.
c54939	Therefore, thou
c54940	son of man,
c54941	prepare thee stuff for removing,
c54942	and remove by day in their sight;
c54943	and thou shalt remove from thy place to another place in their sight:
c54944	it may be they will consider,
c54945	though they <i>be</i> a rebellious house.
c54946	Then shalt thou bring forth thy stuff by day in their sight, as stuff for removing:
c54947	and thou shalt go forth at even in their sight, as they that go forth into captivity.
c54948	Dig thou through the wall in their sight,
c54949	and carry out thereby.
c54950	In their sight shalt thou bear <i>it</i> upon <i>thy</i> shoulders,
c54951	<i>and</i> carry <i>it</i> forth in the twilight:
c54952	thou shalt cover thy face,
c54953	that thou see not the ground:
c54954	for I have set thee <i>for</i> a sign unto the house of Israel.
c54955	And I did so
c54956	as I was commanded:
c54957	I brought forth my stuff by day, as stuff for captivity,
c54958	and in the even I digged through the wall with mine hand;
c54959	I brought <i>it</i> forth in the twilight,
c54960	<i>and</i> I bare <i>it</i> upon <i>my</i> shoulder in their sight.
c54961	And in the morning came the word of the LORD unto
c54962	me, saying,
c54963	Son of man,
c54964	hath not the house of Israel, the rebellious house, said unto
c54965	thee, What doest thou?
c54966	Say thou unto
c54967	them, Thus saith the Lord GOD;
c54968	This burden <i>concerneth</i> the prince in Jerusalem,
c54969	and all the house of Israel
c54970	that <i>are</i> among them.
c54971	Say,
c54972	I <i>am</i> your sign:
c54973	like as I have done,
c54974	so shall it be done
c54975	unto them: they shall remove <i>and</i> go into captivity.
c54976	And the prince
c54977	that <i>is</i> among
c54978	them shall bear upon <i>his</i> shoulder in the twilight,
c54979	and shall go forth:
c54980	they shall dig through the wall
c54981	to carry out
c54982	thereby: he shall cover his face,
c54983	that he see not the ground with <i>his</i> eyes.
c54984	My net also will I spread upon
c54985	him, and he shall be taken in my snare:
c54986	and I will bring him to Babylon <i>to</i> the land of the Chaldeans;
c54987	yet shall he not see
c54988	it, though he shall die there.
c54991	And I will scatter toward every wind all that <i>are</i> about him to help him, and all his bands;
c54992	and I will draw out the sword after them.
c54993	And they shall know
c54994	that I <i>am</i> the LORD,
c54995	when I shall scatter them among the nations,
c54996	and disperse them in the countries.
c54997	But I will leave a few men of them from the sword, from the famine, and from the pestilence;
c54998	that they may declare all their abominations among the heathen
c54999	whither they come;
c55000	and they shall know
c55001	that I <i>am</i> the LORD.
c55002	Moreover the word of the LORD came to
c55003	me, saying,
c55004	Son of man,
c55005	eat thy bread with quaking,
c55006	and drink thy water with trembling and with carefulness;
c55007	And say unto the people of the land, Thus saith the Lord GOD of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, <i>and</i> of the land
c55008	of Israel;
c55009	They shall eat their bread with carefulness,
c55010	and drink their water with astonishment,
c55011	that her land may be desolate from all that is therein, because of the violence of all
c55012	them that dwell therein.
c55013	And the cities
c55014	that are inhabited
c55015	shall be laid waste,
c55016	and the land shall be desolate;
c55017	and ye shall know
c55018	that I <i>am</i> the LORD.
c55019	And the word of the LORD came unto
c55020	me, saying,
c55021	Son of man,
c55022	what <i>is</i> that proverb <i>that</i> ye have in the land of Israel,
c55023	saying,
c55024	The days are prolonged,
c55025	and every vision faileth?
c55026	them therefore,
c55027	Tell
c55028	Thus saith the Lord GOD;
c55029	I will make this proverb to cease,
c55030	and they shall no more use it as a proverb in Israel;
c55031	but say unto
c55032	them, The days are at hand,
c55033	and the effect of every vision.
c55034	For there shall be no more any vain vision nor flattering divination within the house of Israel.
c55035	For I <i>am</i> the LORD:
c55036	I will speak,
c55037	that I shall speak
c55038	and the word
c55039	shall come to pass;
c55040	it shall be no more prolonged:
c55041	for in your days,
c55042	O rebellious house,
c55043	will I say the word,
c55044	and will perform
c55045	it, saith the Lord GOD.
c55046	Again the word of the LORD came to
c55047	me, saying,
c55048	Son of man,
c55049	behold,
c55050	<i>they of</i> the house of Israel say,
c55051	The vision
c55052	that he seeth
c55053	<i>is</i> for many days
c55054	<i>to come,</i> and he prophesieth of the times <i>that are</i> far off.
c55055	Therefore
c55056	say unto
c55057	them, Thus saith the Lord GOD;
c55058	There shall none of my words be prolonged any more,
c55059	but the word which I have spoken
c55060	shall be done,
c55061	saith the Lord GOD.
c55062	And the word of the LORD came unto
c55063	me, saying,
c55064	Son of man,
c55065	prophesy against the prophets of Israel
c55066	that prophesy,
c55067	and say thou unto them that prophesy out of their own hearts,
c55068	Hear ye the word of the LORD;
c55069	Thus saith the Lord GOD;
c55070	Woe unto the foolish prophets,
c55071	that follow their own spirit,
c55072	and have seen nothing!
c55073	thy prophets are like the foxes in the deserts.
c55074	O Israel,
c55076	Ye have not gone up into the gaps,
c55077	neither made up the hedge for the house of Israel
c55078	to stand in the battle in the day of the LORD.
c55079	They have seen vanity and lying divination,
c55080	saying,
c55081	The LORD saith:
c55082	and the LORD hath not sent
c55083	them: and they have made <i>others</i> to hope
c55084	that they would confirm the word.
c55085	Have ye not seen a vain vision,
c55086	a lying divination, whereas ye say,
c55087	and have ye not spoken
c55088	The LORD saith
c55089	<i>it;</i> albeit I have not spoken?
c55090	Therefore
c55091	thus saith the Lord GOD;
c55092	Because ye have spoken vanity,
c55093	and seen lies,
c55094	therefore, behold, I <i>am</i> against
c55095	you, saith the Lord GOD.
c55096	And mine hand shall be upon the prophets
c55097	that see vanity,
c55098	and that divine lies:
c55099	they shall not be in the assembly of my people,
c55100	neither shall they be written in the writing of the house of Israel,
c55101	neither shall they enter into the land of Israel;
c55102	and ye shall know
c55103	that I <i>am</i> the Lord GOD.
c55104	Because,
c55105	even because they have seduced my people,
c55106	saying,
c55107	Peace;
c55108	and <i>there was</i> no peace;
c55109	and one built up a wall,
c55110	and, lo, others daubed it with untempered <i>morter:</i>
c55111	Say
c55112	unto them which daub <i>it</i> with untempered
c55113	<i>morter,</i> that it shall fall:
c55114	there shall be an overflowing shower;
c55115	and ye,
c55116	O great hailstones,
c55117	shall fall;
c55118	and a stormy wind shall rend <i>it.</i>
c55119	Lo, when the wall is fallen,
c55120	shall it not be said unto
c55121	you, Where <i>is</i> the daubing
c55122	wherewith ye have daubed <i>it?</i>
c55123	Therefore
c55124	thus saith the Lord GOD;
c55125	I will even rend <i>it</i> with a stormy wind in my fury;
c55126	and there shall be an overflowing shower in mine anger,
c55127	and great hailstones in <i>my</i> fury to consume <i>it.</i>
c55128	So will I break down the wall
c55129	that ye have daubed with untempered
c55130	<i>morter,</i> and bring it down to the ground,
c55131	so that the foundation thereof shall be discovered,
c55132	and it shall fall,
c55133	and ye shall be consumed in the midst
c55134	thereof: and ye shall know
c55135	that I <i>am</i> the LORD.
c55136	Thus will I accomplish my wrath upon the wall,
c55137	and upon them that have daubed it with untempered
c55138	<i>morter,</i> and will say
c55139	unto you, The wall <i>is</i> no
c55140	<i>more,</i> neither
c55141	they that daubed it;
c55142	<i>To wit,</i> the prophets of Israel
c55143	which prophesy concerning Jerusalem,
c55144	and which see visions of peace
c55145	for her, and <i>there is</i> no peace,
c55146	saith the Lord GOD.
c55147	Likewise, thou
c55148	son of man,
c55149	set thy face against the daughters of thy people,
c55150	which prophesy out of their own heart;
c55151	and prophesy thou against them,
c55152	And say,
c55153	Thus saith the Lord GOD;
c55154	Woe
c55155	to the <i>women</i> that sew pillows to all armholes,
c55156	and make kerchiefs upon the head of every stature
c55157	to hunt souls!
c55158	Will ye hunt the souls of my people,
c55159	and will ye save the souls alive <i>that come</i> unto you?
c55160	And will ye pollute me among my people for handfuls of barley and for pieces of bread,
c55161	to slay the souls
c55162	that should not die,
c55163	and to save the souls alive
c55164	that should not live,
c55165	by your lying to my people
c55166	that hear <i>your</i> lies?
c55167	Wherefore
c55168	thus saith the Lord GOD;
c55169	Behold, I <i>am</i> against your pillows,
c55170	wherewith ye there hunt the souls to make <i>them</i> fly,
c55171	and I will tear them from your arms,
c55172	and will let the souls go,
c55173	<i>even</i> the souls that ye hunt to make <i>them</i> fly.
c55174	Your kerchiefs also will I tear,
c55175	and deliver my people out of your hand,
c55176	and they shall be no more in your hand to be hunted;
c55177	and ye shall know
c55178	that I <i>am</i> the LORD.
c55179	Because with lies ye have made the heart of the righteous sad,
c55180	whom I have not made sad;
c55181	and strengthened the hands
c55182	of the wicked, that he should not return from his wicked way,
c55183	by promising him life:
c55184	Therefore ye shall see no more vanity,
c55185	nor divine divinations:
c55186	for I will deliver my people out of your hand:
c55187	and ye shall know
c55188	that I <i>am</i> the LORD.
c55189	Then came certain of the elders of Israel unto
c55190	me, and sat before me.
c55191	And the word of the LORD came unto
c55192	me, saying,
c55193	Son of man,
c55194	these men have set up their idols in their heart,
c55195	and put the stumblingblock of their iniquity before their face:
c55196	should I be enquired of at all by them?
c55197	Therefore speak
c55198	unto them, and say unto
c55199	them, Thus saith the Lord GOD;
c55200	Every man of the house of Israel
c55201	that setteth up his idols in his heart,
c55202	and putteth the stumblingblock of his iniquity before his face,
c55203	and cometh to the prophet;
c55204	I the LORD will answer
c55205	him that cometh
c55206	according to the multitude of his idols;
c55207	That I may take the house of Israel in their own heart,
c55208	because they are all estranged from me through their idols.
c55209	Therefore say unto the house of Israel,
c55210	Thus saith the Lord GOD;
c55211	Repent,
c55212	and turn <i>yourselves</i> from your idols;
c55213	and turn away your faces from all your abominations.
c55214	For every one of the house of Israel, or of the stranger
c55215	that sojourneth in Israel,
c55216	which separateth himself from
c55217	me, and setteth up his idols in his heart,
c55218	and putteth the stumblingblock of his iniquity before his face,
c55219	and cometh to a prophet
c55220	to enquire
c55221	of him concerning me; I the LORD will answer him by myself:
c55222	And I will set my face against that man,
c55223	and will make him a sign and a proverb,
c55224	and I will cut him off from the midst of my people;
c55225	and ye shall know
c55226	that I <i>am</i> the LORD.
c55228	And if the prophet be deceived
c55229	when he hath spoken a thing,
c55230	I the LORD have deceived that prophet,
c55231	and I will stretch out my hand upon
c55232	him, and will destroy him from the midst of my people Israel.
c55233	And they shall bear the punishment of their iniquity:
c55234	the punishment of the prophet shall be even as the punishment of him that seeketh <i>unto him;</i>
c55235	That the house of Israel may go no more astray from
c55236	me, neither be polluted any more with all their transgressions;
c55237	but that they may be my people,
c55238	and I may be their God,
c55239	saith the Lord GOD.
c55240	The word of the LORD came again to
c55241	me, saying,
c55242	Son of man,
c55244	when the land sinneth
c55245	against me by trespassing grievously,
c55246	then will I stretch out mine hand upon
c55247	it, and will break the staff of the bread
c55248	thereof, and will send famine
c55249	upon it, and will cut off man and beast from it:
c55250	Though these three men, Noah, Daniel, and Job, were in
c55251	it, they should deliver <i>but</i> their own souls by their righteousness,
c55252	saith the Lord GOD.
c55253	If I cause noisome beasts to pass through the land,
c55254	and they spoil
c55255	it, so that it be desolate,
c55256	that no man may pass through because of the beasts:
c55257	<i>Though</i> these three men <i>were</i> in
c55258	it, <i>as</i> I live,
c55259	saith the Lord GOD,
c55260	neither sons
c55261	nor daughters; they only shall be delivered,
c55262	they shall deliver
c55263	but the land shall be desolate.
c55264	Or <i>if</i> I bring a sword upon that land,
c55265	and say,
c55266	Sword, go through the land;
c55267	so that I cut off man and beast from it:
c55268	Though these three men <i>were</i> in
c55269	it, <i>as</i> I live,
c55270	saith the Lord GOD,
c55271	they shall deliver neither sons nor daughters,
c55272	but they only shall be delivered themselves.
c55273	Or <i>if</i> I send a pestilence into that land,
c55274	and pour out my fury upon it in blood,
c55275	to cut off from it man and beast:
c55276	Though Noah, Daniel, and Job, <i>were</i> in
c55277	it, <i>as</i> I live,
c55278	saith the Lord GOD,
c55279	neither son
c55280	nor daughter; they shall <i>but</i> deliver their own souls by their righteousness.
c55281	they shall deliver
c55282	For thus saith the Lord GOD;
c55283	How much more
c55284	when I send my four sore judgments upon Jerusalem, the sword, and the famine, and the noisome beast, and the pestilence,
c55285	to cut off from it man and beast?
c55286	Yet, behold, therein shall be left a remnant
c55287	that shall be brought forth,
c55288	<i>both</i> sons and daughters:
c55289	behold, they shall come forth unto
c55290	you, and ye shall see their way and their doings: and ye shall be comforted concerning the evil
c55292	that I have brought upon Jerusalem, <i>even</i> concerning all
c55293	that I have brought upon it.
c55294	And they shall comfort
c55295	you, when ye see their ways and their doings:
c55296	and ye shall know
c55297	that I have not done without cause all
c55298	that I have done
c55299	in it, saith the Lord GOD.
c55300	And the word of the LORD came unto
c55301	me, saying,
c55302	Son of man,
c55303	What is the vine tree more than any tree, <i>or than</i> a branch
c55304	which is among the trees of the forest?
c55305	Shall wood be taken thereof
c55306	to do any work?
c55307	or will <i>men</i> take a pin of
c55308	it to hang any vessel thereon?
c55309	Behold, it is cast into the fire for fuel;
c55310	the fire devoureth both the ends
c55311	of it, and the midst of it is burned.
c55312	Is it meet for <i>any</i> work?
c55313	Behold,
c55314	when it was whole,
c55315	it was meet for no work:
c55316	how much less
c55317	when the fire hath devoured
c55318	it, and it is burned?
c55319	shall it be meet yet for <i>any</i> work,
c55320	Therefore
c55321	thus saith the Lord GOD;
c55322	As the vine tree among the trees of the forest,
c55323	which I have given to the fire for fuel,
c55324	so will I give the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
c55325	And I will set my face
c55326	against them; they shall go out from <i>one</i> fire,
c55327	and <i>another</i> fire shall devour
c55328	them; and ye shall know
c55329	that I <i>am</i> the LORD,
c55330	when I set my face against them.
c55331	And I will make the land desolate,
c55332	because they have committed a trespass,
c55333	saith the Lord GOD.
c55334	Again the word of the LORD came unto
c55335	me, saying,
c55336	Son of man,
c55337	cause Jerusalem to know her abominations,
c55338	And say,
c55339	Thus saith the Lord GOD unto Jerusalem;
c55340	Thy birth and thy nativity <i>is</i> of the land of Canaan;
c55341	thy father <i>was</i> an Amorite,
c55342	and thy mother an Hittite.
c55343	And <i>as for</i> thy nativity,
c55344	in the day
c55345	thou wast born
c55346	thy navel was not cut,
c55347	neither wast thou washed in water to supple
c55348	<i>thee;</i> thou wast not salted at all,
c55349	nor swaddled at all.
c55350	None eye pitied
c55351	thee, to do any of these
c55352	unto thee, to have compassion upon
c55353	thee; but thou wast cast out in the open field, to the lothing of thy person, in the day
c55354	that thou wast born.
c55355	And when I passed by
c55356	thee, and saw
c55357	thee polluted in thine own blood,
c55358	I said
c55359	unto thee <i>when thou wast</i> in thy blood, Live;
c55360	yea, I said
c55361	unto thee <i>when thou wast</i> in thy blood, Live.
c55362	I have caused thee to multiply as the bud of the field,
c55363	and thou hast increased
c55364	and waxen great,
c55365	and thou art come to excellent ornaments:
c55366	<i>thy</i> breasts are fashioned,
c55367	and thine hair is grown,
c55368	whereas thou <i>wast</i> naked and bare.
c55369	Now when I passed by
c55370	thee, and looked upon
c55371	thee, behold, thy time <i>was</i> the time of love;
c55372	and I spread my skirt over
c55373	thee, and covered thy nakedness:
c55374	yea, I sware
c55375	unto thee, and entered into a covenant with
c55376	thee, saith the Lord GOD,
c55377	and thou becamest mine.
c55378	Then washed I thee with water;
c55379	yea, I throughly washed away thy blood from
c55380	thee, and I anointed thee with oil.
c55381	I clothed thee also with broidered work,
c55382	and shod thee with badgers' skin,
c55383	and I girded thee about with fine linen,
c55384	and I covered thee with silk.
c55385	I decked thee also with ornaments,
c55386	and I put bracelets upon thy hands,
c55387	and a chain on thy neck.
c55388	And I put a jewel on thy forehead,
c55389	and earrings in thine ears,
c55390	and a beautiful crown upon thine head.
c55391	Thus wast thou decked with gold and silver;
c55392	and thy raiment <i>was of</i> fine linen, and silk, and broidered work;
c55393	thou didst eat fine flour, and honey, and oil:
c55394	and thou wast exceeding beautiful,
c55395	and thou didst prosper into a kingdom.
c55396	And thy renown went forth among the heathen for thy beauty:
c55397	for it <i>was</i> perfect through my comeliness,
c55398	which I had put upon
c55399	thee, saith the Lord GOD.
c55400	But thou didst trust in thine own beauty,
c55401	and playedst the harlot because of thy renown,
c55402	and pouredst out thy fornications on every one that passed by;
c55403	his it was.
c55404	And of thy garments thou didst take,
c55405	and deckedst thy high places with divers colours,
c55406	and playedst the harlot thereupon:
c55407	<i>the like things</i> shall not come,
c55408	neither shall it be <i>so.</i>
c55409	Thou hast also taken thy fair jewels of my gold and of my silver,
c55410	which I had given
c55411	thee, and madest to thyself images of men,
c55412	and didst commit whoredom with them,
c55413	And tookest thy broidered garments,
c55414	and coveredst
c55415	them: and thou hast set mine oil and mine incense before them.
c55416	My meat
c55417	also which I gave
c55418	thee, fine flour, and oil, and honey, <i>wherewith</i> I fed
c55419	thee, thou hast even set it before them for a sweet savour:
c55420	and <i>thus</i> it was,
c55421	saith the Lord GOD.
c55422	Moreover thou hast taken thy sons and thy daughters,
c55423	whom thou hast borne
c55424	unto me, and these hast thou sacrificed
c55425	unto them to be devoured.
c55426	<i>Is this</i> of thy whoredoms a small matter,
c55427	That thou hast slain my children,
c55428	and delivered
c55429	them to cause them to pass through <i>the fire</i> for them?
c55430	And in all thine abominations and thy whoredoms thou hast not remembered the days of thy youth,
c55431	when thou wast naked and bare,
c55432	<i>and</i> wast polluted in thy blood.
c55433	And it came to pass after all thy wickedness,
c55434	(woe, woe
c55435	unto thee! saith the Lord GOD;)
c55436	<i>That</i> thou hast also built unto thee an eminent place,
c55437	and hast made thee an high place in every street.
c55438	Thou hast built thy high place at every head of the way,
c55439	and hast made thy beauty to be abhorred,
c55440	and hast opened thy feet to every one that passed by,
c55441	and multiplied thy whoredoms.
c55442	Thou hast also committed fornication with the Egyptians thy neighbours, great of flesh;
c55443	and hast increased thy whoredoms,
c55444	to provoke me to anger.
c55445	Behold, therefore I have stretched out my hand over
c55446	thee, and have diminished thine ordinary
c55447	<i>food,</i> and delivered thee unto the will of them that hate thee, the daughters of the Philistines,
c55448	which are ashamed of thy lewd way.
c55449	Thou hast played the whore also with the Assyrians, because thou wast unsatiable; yea, thou hast played the harlot
c55451	with them, and yet couldest not be satisfied.
c55452	Thou hast moreover multiplied thy fornication in the land of Canaan unto Chaldea;
c55453	and yet thou wast not satisfied herewith.
c55454	How weak is thine heart,
c55455	saith the Lord GOD,
c55456	seeing thou doest all these
c55457	<i>things,</i> the work of an imperious whorish woman;
c55458	In that thou buildest thine eminent place in the head of every way,
c55459	and makest thine high place in every street;
c55460	and hast not been as an harlot,
c55461	in that thou scornest hire;
c55462	<i>But as</i> a wife
c55463	that committeth adultery,
c55464	<i>which</i> taketh strangers instead of her husband!
c55465	They give gifts to all whores:
c55466	but thou givest thy gifts to all thy lovers,
c55467	and hirest
c55468	them, that they may come unto thee on every side for thy whoredom.
c55469	And the contrary is in thee from <i>other</i> women in thy whoredoms,
c55470	whereas none followeth thee to commit whoredoms:
c55471	and in that thou givest a reward,
c55472	and no reward is given
c55473	unto thee, therefore thou art contrary.
c55474	Wherefore,
c55475	O harlot,
c55476	hear the word of the LORD:
c55477	Thus saith the Lord GOD;
c55478	Because thy filthiness was poured out,
c55479	and thy nakedness discovered through thy whoredoms with thy lovers, and with all the idols of thy abominations,
c55480	and by the blood of thy children,
c55481	which thou didst give unto them;
c55482	Behold, therefore I will gather all thy lovers,
c55483	with whom thou hast taken pleasure,
c55484	and all
c55485	<i>them</i> that thou hast loved,
c55486	with all
c55487	<i>them</i> that thou hast hated;
c55488	I will even gather them round about against
c55489	thee, and will discover thy nakedness unto
c55490	them, that they may see all thy nakedness.
c55491	And I will judge thee, as women that break wedlock and shed blood are judged;
c55492	and I will give thee blood in fury and jealousy.
c55493	And I will also give thee into their hand,
c55494	and they shall throw down thine eminent place,
c55495	and shall break down thy high places:
c55496	they shall strip thee also of thy clothes,
c55497	and shall take thy fair jewels,
c55498	and leave thee naked and bare.
c55499	They shall also bring up a company against
c55500	thee, and they shall stone thee with stones,
c55501	and thrust thee through with their swords.
c55502	And they shall burn thine houses with fire,
c55503	and execute judgments upon thee in the sight of many women:
c55504	and I will cause thee to cease from playing the harlot,
c55505	and thou also shalt give no hire any more.
c55506	So will I make my fury toward thee to rest,
c55507	and my jealousy shall depart from
c55508	thee, and I will be quiet,
c55509	and will be no more angry.
c55510	Because thou hast not remembered the days of thy youth,
c55511	but hast fretted me in all these
c55513	<i>things;</i> behold, therefore I also will recompense thy way upon <i>thine</i> head,
c55514	saith the Lord GOD:
c55515	and thou shalt not commit this lewdness above all thine abominations.
c55516	Behold, every one that useth proverbs shall use <i>this</i> proverb against
c55517	thee, saying,
c55518	As <i>is</i> the mother, <i>so is</i> her daughter.
c55519	Thou <i>art</i> thy mother's daughter,
c55520	that lotheth her husband and her children;
c55521	and thou <i>art</i> the sister of thy sisters,
c55522	which lothed their husbands and their children:
c55523	your mother <i>was</i> an Hittite,
c55524	and your father an Amorite.
c55525	And thine elder sister <i>is</i> Samaria, she and her daughters
c55526	that dwell at thy left hand:
c55527	sister,
c55528	and thy younger
c55529	that dwelleth at thy right hand,
c55530	<i>is</i> Sodom and her daughters.
c55531	Yet hast thou not walked after their ways,
c55532	nor done after their abominations:
c55533	but, as <i>if that were</i> a very little
c55534	<i>thing,</i> thou wast corrupted more than they in all thy ways.
c55535	<i>As</i> I live,
c55536	saith the Lord GOD,
c55537	Sodom thy sister hath not done, she nor her daughters,
c55538	as thou hast done, thou and thy daughters.
c55539	Behold, this was the iniquity of thy sister Sodom,
c55540	pride, fulness of bread, and abundance of idleness was in her and in her daughters,
c55541	neither did she strengthen the hand of the poor and needy.
c55542	And they were haughty,
c55543	and committed abomination before
c55544	me: therefore I took them away
c55545	as I saw <i>good.</i>
c55546	Neither hath Samaria committed half of thy sins;
c55547	but thou hast multiplied thine abominations more than
c55548	they, and hast justified thy sisters in all thine abominations
c55549	which thou hast done.
c55550	Thou also, which hast judged thy sisters, bear thine own shame
c55551	for thy sins
c55552	that thou hast committed more abominable than they: they are more righteous than
c55554	thou: yea, be thou confounded also,
c55555	and bear thy shame,
c55556	in that thou hast justified thy sisters.
c55557	When I shall bring again their captivity, the captivity of Sodom and her daughters, and the captivity of Samaria and her daughters,
c55558	then <i>will I bring again</i> the captivity of thy captives in the midst of them:
c55559	That thou mayest bear thine own shame,
c55560	and mayest be confounded in all
c55561	that thou hast done,
c55562	in that thou art a comfort unto them.
c55563	When thy sisters, Sodom and her daughters, shall return to their former estate,
c55564	and Samaria and her daughters shall return to their former estate,
c55565	then thou and thy daughters shall return to your former estate.
c55566	For thy sister Sodom was not mentioned by thy mouth in the day of thy pride,
c55567	Before thy wickedness was discovered, as at the time of <i>thy</i> reproach of the daughters of Syria, and all <i>that are</i> round about her, the daughters of the Philistines,
c55568	which despise thee round about.
c55569	thy lewdness and thine abominations,
c55570	Thou hast borne
c55571	saith the LORD.
c55572	For thus saith the Lord GOD;
c55573	I will even deal with
c55574	thee as thou hast done,
c55575	which hast despised the oath
c55576	in breaking the covenant.
c55577	Nevertheless I will remember my covenant with thee in the days of thy youth,
c55578	and I will establish unto thee an everlasting covenant.
c55579	Then thou shalt remember thy ways,
c55580	and be ashamed,
c55581	when thou shalt receive thy sisters, thine elder and thy younger:
c55582	and I will give them unto thee for daughters,
c55583	but not by thy covenant.
c55584	And I will establish my covenant with
c55585	thee; and thou shalt know
c55586	that I <i>am</i> the LORD:
c55587	That thou mayest remember,
c55588	and be confounded,
c55589	and never open thy mouth any more because of thy shame,
c55590	when I am pacified toward thee for all
c55591	that thou hast done,
c55592	saith the Lord GOD.
c55593	And the word of the LORD came unto
c55594	me, saying,
c55595	Son of man,
c55596	put forth a riddle,
c55597	and speak a parable unto the house of Israel;
c55598	And say,
c55599	Thus saith the Lord GOD;
c55600	A great eagle
c55601	with great wings, longwinged, full of feathers,
c55602	which had divers colours,
c55603	came unto Lebanon,
c55604	and took the highest branch of the cedar:
c55605	He cropped off the top of his young twigs,
c55606	and carried it into a land of traffick;
c55607	he set it in a city of merchants.
c55608	He took also of the seed of the land,
c55609	and planted it in a fruitful field;
c55610	he placed <i>it</i> by great waters,
c55611	<i>and</i> set it <i>as</i> a willow tree.
c55612	And it grew,
c55613	and became a spreading vine of low stature,
c55614	whose branches turned toward
c55615	him, and the roots thereof were under
c55616	him: so it became a vine,
c55617	and brought forth branches,
c55618	and shot forth sprigs.
c55619	There was also another great eagle with great wings and many feathers:
c55620	and, behold, this vine did bend her roots toward him, and shot forth her branches toward
c55622	him, that he might water it by the furrows of her plantation.
c55623	It was planted in a good soil by great waters,
c55624	that it might bring forth branches,
c55625	and that it might bear fruit,
c55626	that it might be a goodly vine.
c55627	Say
c55628	thou, Thus saith the Lord GOD;
c55629	Shall it prosper?
c55630	shall he not pull up the roots
c55631	thereof, and cut off the fruit
c55632	thereof, that it wither? it shall wither in all the leaves of her spring,
c55634	even without great power or many people to pluck it up by the roots thereof.
c55635	Yea, behold, <i>being</i> planted,
c55636	shall it prosper?
c55637	shall it not
c55638	when the east wind toucheth
c55639	utterly wither,
c55640	it? it shall wither in the furrows where it grew.
c55641	Moreover the word of the LORD came unto
c55642	me, saying,
c55643	Say now to the rebellious house,
c55644	Know ye not
c55645	what these
c55646	<i>things mean?</i> tell
c55647	<i>them,</i> Behold, the king of Babylon is come to Jerusalem,
c55648	and hath taken the king thereof, and the princes
c55649	thereof, and led them with him to Babylon;
c55650	And hath taken of the king's seed,
c55651	and made a covenant with
c55652	him, and hath taken an oath
c55653	of him: he hath also taken the mighty of the land:
c55654	That the kingdom might be base,
c55655	that it might not lift itself up,
c55656	<i>but</i> that by keeping of his covenant
c55657	it might stand.
c55658	But he rebelled
c55659	against him in sending his ambassadors into Egypt,
c55660	that they might give him horses and much people.
c55661	Shall he prosper?
c55662	shall he escape
c55663	that doeth such
c55664	<i>things?</i> or shall he break the covenant,
c55665	and be delivered?
c55666	<i>As</i> I live,
c55667	saith the Lord GOD,
c55668	surely in the place <i>where</i> the king
c55669	<i>dwelleth</i> that made him king,
c55670	whose oath he despised,
c55671	and whose covenant he brake,
c55672	<i>even</i> with him in the midst of Babylon he shall die.
c55673	Neither shall Pharaoh with <i>his</i> mighty army and great company make for him in the war,
c55674	by casting up mounts,
c55675	and building forts,
c55676	to cut off many persons:
c55677	Seeing he despised the oath
c55678	by breaking the covenant,
c55679	when, lo, he had given his hand,
c55680	and hath done all these
c55681	<i>things,</i> he shall not escape.
c55682	Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD;
c55683	<i>As</i> I live,
c55684	surely mine oath
c55685	that he hath despised,
c55686	and my covenant
c55687	that he hath broken,
c55688	even it will I recompense upon his own head.
c55689	And I will spread my net upon
c55690	him, and he shall be taken in my snare,
c55691	and I will bring him to Babylon,
c55692	and will plead with him there for his trespass
c55693	that he hath trespassed against me.
c55694	And all his fugitives with all his bands shall fall by the sword,
c55695	and they that remain shall be scattered toward all winds:
c55696	and ye shall know
c55697	that I the LORD have spoken <i>it.</i>
c55698	Thus saith the Lord GOD;
c55699	I will also take of the highest branch of the high cedar,
c55700	and will set
c55701	<i>it;</i> I will crop off from the top of his young twigs a tender one,
c55702	and will plant <i>it</i> upon an high mountain and eminent:
c55703	In the mountain of the height of Israel will I plant
c55704	it: and it shall bring forth boughs,
c55705	and bear fruit,
c55706	and be a goodly cedar:
c55707	and under it shall dwell all fowl of every wing;
c55708	in the shadow of the branches thereof shall they dwell.
c55709	And all the trees of the field shall know
c55710	that I the LORD have brought down the high tree,
c55711	have exalted the low tree,
c55712	have dried up the green tree,
c55713	and have made the dry tree to flourish:
c55714	I the LORD have spoken
c55715	and have done <i>it.</i>
c55716	The word of the LORD came unto
c55717	me again, saying,
c55718	What
c55719	mean ye, that ye use this proverb concerning the land of Israel,
c55720	saying,
c55721	The fathers have eaten sour grapes,
c55722	and the children's teeth are set on edge?
c55723	<i>As</i> I live,
c55724	saith the Lord GOD,
c55725	ye shall not have <i>occasion</i> any more
c55726	to use this proverb in Israel.
c55727	Behold, all souls
c55729	are mine; as the soul of the father, so also the soul of the son
c55730	is mine: the soul
c55731	that sinneth,
c55732	it shall die.
c55734	But if a man be just,
c55735	and do that which is lawful and right,
c55736	<i>And</i> hath not eaten upon the mountains,
c55737	neither hath lifted up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel,
c55738	neither hath defiled his neighbour's wife,
c55739	neither hath come near to a menstruous woman,
c55740	And hath not oppressed any,
c55741	<i>but</i> hath restored to the debtor his pledge,
c55742	hath spoiled none by violence,
c55743	hath given his bread to the hungry,
c55744	and hath covered the naked with a garment;
c55745	He <i>that</i> hath not given forth upon usury,
c55746	neither hath taken any increase,
c55747	<i>that</i> hath withdrawn his hand from iniquity,
c55748	hath executed true judgment between man and man,
c55749	Hath walked in my statutes,
c55750	and hath kept my judgments,
c55751	to deal truly;
c55752	he <i>is</i> just,
c55753	he shall surely live,
c55754	saith the Lord GOD.
c55755	If he beget a son <i>that is</i> a robber,
c55756	a shedder of blood,
c55757	and <i>that</i> doeth the like to <i>any</i> one of these <i>things,</i>
c55758	And that doeth not any of those
c55759	<i>duties,</i> but even hath eaten upon the mountains,
c55760	and defiled his neighbour's wife,
c55761	Hath oppressed the poor and needy,
c55762	hath spoiled by violence,
c55763	hath not restored the pledge,
c55764	and hath lifted up his eyes to the idols,
c55765	hath committed abomination,
c55766	Hath given forth upon usury,
c55767	and hath taken increase:
c55768	live:
c55769	shall he then live? he shall not
c55770	he hath done all these abominations;
c55771	he shall surely die;
c55772	his blood shall be upon him.
c55773	Now, lo, <i>if</i> he beget a son,
c55774	that seeth all his father's sins
c55775	which he hath done,
c55776	and considereth,
c55777	and doeth not such like,
c55778	<i>That</i> hath not eaten upon the mountains,
c55779	neither hath lifted up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel,
c55780	hath not defiled his neighbour's wife,
c55781	Neither hath oppressed any,
c55782	hath not withholden the pledge,
c55783	neither hath spoiled by violence,
c55784	<i>but</i> hath given his bread to the hungry,
c55785	and hath covered the naked with a garment,
c55786	<i>That</i> hath taken off his hand from the poor,
c55787	<i>that</i> hath not received usury nor increase,
c55788	hath executed my judgments,
c55789	hath walked in my statutes;
c55790	he shall not die for the iniquity of his father,
c55791	he shall surely live.
c55792	<i>As for</i> his father,
c55793	because he cruelly oppressed,
c55794	spoiled his brother by violence,
c55797	and did <i>that</i> which <i>is</i> not good among his people,
c55798	lo, even he shall die in his iniquity.
c55799	Yet say
c55800	ye, Why? doth not the son bear the iniquity of the father?
c55801	When the son hath done that which is lawful and right,
c55802	<i>and</i> hath kept all my statutes,
c55803	and hath done
c55804	them, he shall surely live.
c55805	The soul
c55806	that sinneth,
c55807	it shall die.
c55808	The son shall not bear the iniquity of the father,
c55809	neither shall the father bear the iniquity of the son:
c55810	the righteousness of the righteous shall be upon
c55811	him, and the wickedness of the wicked shall be upon him.
c55813	But if the wicked will turn from all his sins
c55814	that he hath committed,
c55815	and keep all my statutes,
c55816	and do that which is lawful and right,
c55817	he shall surely live,
c55818	he shall not die.
c55819	All his transgressions
c55820	that he hath committed,
c55821	they shall not be mentioned
c55822	unto him: in his righteousness
c55823	that he hath done
c55824	he shall live.
c55825	Have I any pleasure at all that the wicked should die?
c55826	saith the Lord GOD:
c55827	<i>and</i> not
c55828	that he should return from his ways,
c55829	and live?
c55831	But when the righteous turneth away from his righteousness,
c55832	and committeth iniquity, <i>and</i> doeth according to all the abominations
c55833	that the wicked
c55834	<i>man</i> doeth,
c55835	shall he live?
c55836	All his righteousness
c55837	that he hath done
c55838	shall not be mentioned:
c55839	he hath trespassed,
c55840	in his trespass that
c55841	and in his sin
c55842	that he hath sinned,
c55843	in them shall he die.
c55844	Yet ye say,
c55845	The way of the Lord is not equal.
c55846	Hear now,
c55847	O house of Israel;
c55848	Is not my way equal?
c55849	are not your ways unequal?
c55850	When a righteous <i>man</i> turneth away from his righteousness,
c55851	and committeth iniquity,
c55852	and dieth in
c55853	them; for his iniquity
c55854	that he hath done
c55855	shall he die.
c55857	Again, when the wicked <i>man</i> turneth away from his wickedness
c55858	that he hath committed,
c55859	and doeth that which is lawful and right,
c55860	he shall save his soul alive.
c55861	Because he considereth,
c55862	and turneth away from all his transgressions
c55863	that he hath committed,
c55864	he shall surely live,
c55865	he shall not die.
c55866	Yet saith the house of Israel,
c55867	The way of the Lord is not equal.
c55868	are not my ways equal?
c55869	O house of Israel,
c55870	are not your ways unequal?
c55871	Therefore
c55872	every one according to his ways,
c55873	I will judge
c55874	you, O house of Israel,
c55875	saith the Lord GOD.
c55876	Repent,
c55877	and turn <i>yourselves</i> from all your transgressions;
c55878	so iniquity shall not be your ruin.
c55879	Cast away from you all your transgressions,
c55880	whereby ye have transgressed;
c55881	and make you a new heart and a new spirit:
c55882	for why will ye die,
c55883	O house of Israel?
c55884	For I have no pleasure in the death of him that dieth,
c55885	saith the Lord GOD:
c55886	wherefore turn
c55887	<i>yourselves,</i> and live ye.
c55888	Moreover take thou up a lamentation for the princes of Israel,
c55889	And say,
c55890	What <i>is</i> thy mother? A lioness: she lay down among lions,
c55891	among young lions.
c55892	she nourished her whelps
c55893	And she brought up one of her whelps:
c55894	it became a young lion,
c55895	and it learned
c55896	to catch the prey;
c55897	it devoured men.
c55898	The nations also heard of
c55899	him; he was taken in their pit,
c55900	and they brought him with chains unto the land of Egypt.
c55901	Now when she saw
c55902	that she had waited,
c55903	<i>and</i> her hope was lost,
c55904	then she took another of her whelps,
c55905	<i>and</i> made him a young lion.
c55906	And he went up and down among the lions,
c55907	he became a young lion,
c55908	and learned
c55909	to catch the prey,
c55910	<i>and</i> devoured men.
c55911	And he knew their desolate palaces,
c55912	and he laid waste their cities;
c55913	and the land was desolate, and the fulness thereof, by the noise of his roaring.
c55914	Then the nations set against him on every side from the provinces,
c55915	and spread their net over
c55916	him: he was taken in their pit.
c55917	And they put him in ward in chains,
c55918	and brought him to the king of Babylon:
c55919	they brought him into holds,
c55920	that his voice should no more be heard upon the mountains of Israel.
c55921	Thy mother <i>is</i> like a vine in thy blood,
c55922	planted by the waters:
c55923	she was fruitful and full of branches by reason of many waters.
c55924	And she had strong rods for the sceptres of them that bare rule,
c55925	and her stature was exalted among the thick branches,
c55926	and she appeared in her height with the multitude of her branches.
c55927	But she was plucked up in fury,
c55928	she was cast down to the ground,
c55929	and the east wind dried up
c55930	her fruit: her strong rods were broken
c55931	and withered;
c55932	the fire consumed them.
c55933	And now she <i>is</i> planted in the wilderness, in a dry and thirsty ground.
c55934	And fire is gone out of a rod of her branches,
c55935	<i>which</i> hath devoured her fruit,
c55936	so that she hath no strong rod
c55937	<i>to be</i> a sceptre
c55938	to rule.
c55939	This <i>is</i> a lamentation,
c55940	and shall be for a lamentation.
c55941	And it came to pass in the seventh year, in the fifth <i>month,</i> the tenth <i>day</i> of the month,
c55942	<i>that</i> certain of the elders of Israel came
c55943	to enquire of the LORD,
c55944	and sat before me.
c55945	Then came the word of the LORD unto
c55946	me, saying,
c55947	Son of man,
c55948	speak unto the elders of Israel,
c55949	and say unto
c55950	them, Thus saith the Lord GOD;
c55951	to enquire
c55952	Are ye come
c55953	of me? <i>As</i> I live,
c55954	I will not be enquired of by you.
c55955	saith the Lord GOD,
c55956	Wilt thou judge
c55957	wilt thou judge
c55958	them, son of man,
c55959	<i>them?</i> cause them to know the abominations of their fathers:
c55960	And say unto
c55961	them, Thus saith the Lord GOD;
c55962	In the day
c55963	when I chose Israel,
c55964	and lifted up mine hand unto the seed of the house of Jacob,
c55965	and made myself known unto them in the land of Egypt,
c55966	when I lifted up mine hand
c55967	unto them, saying,
c55968	I <i>am</i> the LORD your God;
c55969	In the day <i>that</i> I lifted up mine hand unto them, to bring them forth of the land of Egypt into a land
c55971	that I had espied
c55972	for them, flowing with milk and honey, which
c55973	<i>is</i> the glory of all lands:
c55974	Then said I unto
c55975	them, Cast ye away every man the abominations of his eyes,
c55976	and defile not yourselves with the idols of Egypt:
c55977	I <i>am</i> the LORD your God.
c55978	But they rebelled
c55979	against me, and would not
c55980	hearken unto
c55981	me: they did not every man cast away the abominations of their eyes,
c55982	neither did they forsake the idols of Egypt:
c55983	then I said,
c55984	I will pour out my fury upon
c55985	them, to accomplish my anger against them in the midst of the land of Egypt.
c55986	But I wrought for my name's sake,
c55987	that it should not be polluted before the heathen,
c55988	among whom they
c55989	<i>were,</i> in whose sight I made myself known unto
c55990	them, in bringing them forth out of the land of Egypt.
c55991	Wherefore I caused them to go forth out of the land of Egypt,
c55992	and brought them into the wilderness.
c55993	And I gave them my statutes,
c55994	and shewed them my judgments,
c55995	which <i>if</i> a man do,
c55996	he shall even live in them.
c55997	Moreover also I gave them my sabbaths,
c55998	to be a sign between
c55999	me and them, that they might know
c56000	that I <i>am</i> the LORD
c56001	that sanctify them.
c56002	But the house of Israel rebelled against me in the wilderness:
c56003	they walked not in my statutes,
c56004	and they despised my judgments,
c56005	which <i>if</i> a man do,
c56006	he shall even live
c56007	in them; and my sabbaths they greatly polluted:
c56008	then I said,
c56009	I would pour out my fury upon them in the wilderness,
c56010	to consume them.
c56011	But I wrought for my name's sake,
c56012	that it should not be polluted before the heathen,
c56013	in whose sight I brought them out.
c56014	Yet also I lifted up my hand unto them in the wilderness,
c56015	that I would not bring them into the land
c56016	which I had given
c56017	<i>them,</i> flowing with milk and honey,
c56018	which <i>is</i> the glory of all lands;
c56019	Because they despised my judgments,
c56020	in my statutes,
c56021	and walked not
c56022	but polluted my sabbaths:
c56023	for their heart went after their idols.
c56024	Nevertheless mine eye spared
c56025	them from destroying
c56026	them, neither did I make an end of them in the wilderness.
c56027	But I said unto their children in the wilderness,
c56028	Walk ye not in the statutes of your fathers,
c56029	neither observe their judgments,
c56030	nor defile yourselves with their idols:
c56031	I <i>am</i> the LORD your God;
c56032	walk in my statutes,
c56033	and keep my judgments,
c56034	and do them;
c56035	And hallow my sabbaths;
c56036	and they shall be a sign between
c56037	me and you, that ye may know
c56038	that I <i>am</i> the LORD your God.
c56039	Notwithstanding the children rebelled
c56040	against me: they walked not in my statutes,
c56041	neither kept my judgments
c56042	to do
c56043	them, which <i>if</i> a man do,
c56044	he shall even live
c56045	in them; they polluted my sabbaths:
c56046	then I said,
c56047	I would pour out my fury upon
c56048	them, to accomplish my anger against them in the wilderness.
c56049	Nevertheless I withdrew mine hand,
c56050	and wrought for my name's sake,
c56051	that it should not be polluted in the sight of the heathen,
c56052	in whose sight I brought them forth.
c56053	I lifted up mine hand unto them also in the wilderness,
c56054	that I would scatter them among the heathen,
c56055	and disperse them through the countries;
c56056	Because they had not executed my judgments,
c56057	but had despised my statutes,
c56058	and had polluted my sabbaths,
c56059	and their eyes were after their fathers' idols.
c56060	Wherefore I gave them also statutes
c56061	<i>that were</i> not good,
c56062	and judgments
c56063	whereby they should not live;
c56064	And I polluted them in their own gifts,
c56065	in that they caused to pass through <i>the fire</i> all that openeth the womb,
c56066	that I might make them desolate,
c56067	to the end that they might know
c56068	that I <i>am</i> the LORD.
c56069	Therefore,
c56070	speak unto the house of Israel,
c56071	son of man,
c56072	and say unto
c56073	them, Thus saith the Lord GOD;
c56074	Yet in this your fathers have blasphemed
c56075	me, in that they have committed a trespass against me.
c56076	<i>For</i> when I had brought them into the land,
c56077	<i>for</i> the which I lifted up mine hand
c56078	to give
c56079	it to them, then they saw every high hill, and all the thick trees,
c56080	and they offered there their sacrifices,
c56081	and there they presented the provocation of their offering:
c56082	there also they made their sweet savour,
c56083	and poured out there their drink offerings.
c56084	Then I said unto
c56085	them, What <i>is</i> the high place
c56086	whereunto ye go?
c56087	And the name thereof is called Bamah unto this day.
c56088	Wherefore
c56089	say unto the house of Israel,
c56090	Thus saith the Lord GOD;
c56091	Are ye polluted after the manner of your fathers?
c56092	and commit ye whoredom after their abominations?
c56093	For when ye offer your gifts,
c56094	when ye make your sons to pass through the fire,
c56095	ye pollute yourselves with all your idols, even unto this day:
c56096	and shall I be enquired of
c56097	by you, O house of Israel?
c56098	<i>As</i> I live,
c56099	saith the Lord GOD,
c56100	I will not be enquired of by you.
c56102	And that which cometh into your mind
c56103	shall not be at all,
c56104	that ye say,
c56105	We will be as the heathen, as the families of the countries,
c56106	to serve wood and stone.
c56107	<i>As</i> I live,
c56108	saith the Lord GOD,
c56109	surely with a mighty hand, and with a stretched out arm, and with fury poured out, will I rule over you:
c56110	And I will bring you out from the people,
c56111	and will gather you out of the countries
c56112	wherein ye are scattered,
c56113	with a mighty hand, and with a stretched out arm, and with fury poured out.
c56114	And I will bring you into the wilderness of the people,
c56115	and there will I plead with you face to face.
c56116	Like as I pleaded with your fathers in the wilderness of the land of Egypt,
c56117	so will I plead with
c56118	you, saith the Lord GOD.
c56119	And I will cause you to pass under the rod,
c56120	and I will bring you into the bond of the covenant:
c56121	And I will purge out from
c56122	among you the rebels,
c56123	and them that transgress
c56124	against me: I will bring them forth out of the country where they sojourn,
c56125	and they shall not enter into the land of Israel:
c56126	and ye shall know
c56127	that I <i>am</i> the LORD.
c56128	As for you,
c56129	O house of Israel,
c56130	thus saith the Lord GOD;
c56131	ye every one his idols,
c56132	Go
c56133	ye, serve
c56134	and hereafter
c56135	<i>also,</i> if ye will not hearken unto
c56136	me: but pollute ye my holy name no more with your gifts, and with your idols.
c56137	For in mine holy mountain, in the mountain of the height of Israel,
c56138	saith the Lord GOD,
c56139	there shall all the house of Israel, all of them in the land, serve
c56140	me: there will I accept
c56141	them, and there will I require your offerings, and the firstfruits of your oblations, with all your holy things.
c56142	I will accept you with your sweet savour,
c56143	when I bring you out from the people,
c56144	and gather you out of the countries
c56145	wherein ye have been scattered;
c56146	and I will be sanctified in you before the heathen.
c56147	And ye shall know
c56148	that I <i>am</i> the LORD,
c56149	when I shall bring you into the land of Israel, into the country
c56150	<i>for</i> the which I lifted up mine hand
c56151	to give it to your fathers.
c56152	And there shall ye remember your ways, and all your doings,
c56153	wherein ye have been defiled;
c56154	and ye shall lothe yourselves in your own sight for all your evils
c56155	that ye have committed.
c56156	And ye shall know
c56157	that I <i>am</i> the LORD,
c56158	when I have wrought with you for my name's sake, not according to your wicked ways, nor according to your corrupt doings,
c56159	O ye house of Israel,
c56160	saith the Lord GOD.
c56161	Moreover the word of the LORD came unto
c56162	me, saying,
c56163	Son of man,
c56164	set thy face toward the south,
c56165	and drop <i>thy word</i> toward the south,
c56166	and prophesy against the forest of the south field;
c56167	And say to the forest of the south,
c56168	Hear the word of the LORD;
c56169	Thus saith the Lord GOD;
c56170	Behold, I will kindle a fire
c56171	in thee, and it shall devour every green tree in thee, and every dry tree:
c56172	the flaming flame shall not be quenched,
c56173	and all faces from the south to the north shall be burned therein.
c56174	And all flesh shall see
c56175	that I the LORD have kindled
c56176	it: it shall not be quenched.
c56177	Then said
c56178	I, Ah
c56179	Lord GOD!
c56180	they say
c56181	of me, Doth he not speak parables?
c56182	And the word of the LORD came unto
c56183	me, saying,
c56184	Son of man,
c56185	set thy face toward Jerusalem,
c56186	and drop <i>thy word</i> toward the holy places,
c56187	and prophesy against the land of Israel,
c56188	And say to the land of Israel,
c56189	Thus saith the LORD;
c56190	Behold, I <i>am</i> against
c56191	thee, and will draw forth my sword out of his sheath,
c56192	and will cut off from thee the righteous and the wicked.
c56193	Seeing then that I will cut off from thee the righteous and the wicked,
c56194	therefore shall my sword go forth out of his sheath against all flesh from the south to the north:
c56195	That all flesh may know
c56196	that I the LORD have drawn forth my sword out of his sheath:
c56197	it shall not return any more.
c56199	son of man, with the breaking of <i>thy</i> loins;
c56200	Sigh therefore, thou
c56201	and with bitterness sigh before their eyes.
c56202	And it shall be,
c56203	when they say unto
c56204	thee, Wherefore sighest thou?
c56205	that thou shalt answer,
c56206	For the tidings;
c56207	because it cometh:
c56208	and every heart shall melt,
c56209	and all hands shall be feeble,
c56210	and every spirit shall faint,
c56211	and all knees shall be weak <i>as</i> water:
c56212	behold, it cometh,
c56213	and shall be brought to pass,
c56214	saith the Lord GOD.
c56215	Again the word of the LORD came unto
c56216	me, saying,
c56217	Son of man,
c56218	prophesy,
c56219	and say,
c56220	Thus saith the LORD;
c56221	Say,
c56222	A sword,
c56223	a sword is sharpened,
c56224	and also furbished:
c56225	to make a sore slaughter;
c56226	It is sharpened
c56227	that it may glitter:
c56228	it is furbished
c56229	should we then make mirth?
c56230	it contemneth the rod of my son, <i>as</i> every tree.
c56231	And he hath given
c56232	it to be furbished,
c56233	that it may be handled:
c56234	this sword is sharpened,
c56235	and it is furbished,
c56236	to give it into the hand of the slayer.
c56237	Cry
c56238	and howl,
c56239	son of man:
c56240	for it shall be upon my people,
c56241	it <i>shall be</i> upon all the princes of Israel:
c56242	terrors by reason of the sword shall be upon my people:
c56243	smite therefore upon <i>thy</i> thigh.
c56244	Because <i>it is</i> a trial,
c56245	and what
c56246	if <i>the sword</i> contemn even the rod?
c56247	it shall be no
c56248	<i>more,</i> saith the Lord GOD.
c56249	Thou
c56250	therefore, son of man,
c56251	prophesy,
c56252	and smite <i>thine</i> hands together,
c56253	and let the sword be doubled the third time,
c56254	the sword of the slain: it
c56255	<i>is</i> the sword of the great <i>men that are</i> slain,
c56256	which entereth into their privy chambers.
c56257	that <i>their</i> heart may faint,
c56258	and <i>their</i> ruins be multiplied:
c56259	I have set the point of the sword against all their gates,
c56260	ah!
c56261	<i>it is</i> made bright,
c56262	<i>it is</i> wrapped up for the slaughter.
c56263	Go thee one way or other,
c56264	<i>either</i> on the right hand,
c56266	<i>or</i> on the left,
c56267	whithersoever thy face <i>is</i> set.
c56268	I will also smite mine hands together,
c56269	and I will cause my fury to rest:
c56270	I the LORD have said <i>it.</i>
c56271	The word of the LORD came unto
c56272	me again, saying,
c56273	Also, thou
c56274	son of man,
c56275	appoint thee two ways,
c56276	that the sword of the king of Babylon may come:
c56277	both twain shall come forth out of one land:
c56278	and choose thou a place,
c56279	choose <i>it</i> at the head of the way to the city.
c56280	Appoint a way,
c56281	that the sword may come to Rabbath of the Ammonites, and to Judah in Jerusalem the defenced.
c56282	For the king of Babylon stood at the parting of the way, at the head of the two ways,
c56283	to use divination:
c56284	he made <i>his</i> arrows bright,
c56285	he consulted with images,
c56286	he looked in the liver.
c56287	At his right hand was the divination for Jerusalem,
c56288	to appoint captains,
c56289	to open the mouth in the slaughter,
c56290	to lift up the voice with shouting,
c56291	to appoint <i>battering</i> rams against the gates,
c56292	to cast a mount,
c56293	<i>and</i> to build a fort.
c56294	And it shall be
c56295	unto them as a false divination in their sight,
c56296	to them that have sworn oaths:
c56297	but he will call to remembrance the iniquity,
c56298	that they may be taken.
c56299	Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD;
c56300	Because ye have made your iniquity to be remembered,
c56301	in that your transgressions are discovered,
c56302	so that in all your doings your sins do appear;
c56303	because, <i>I say,</i> that ye are come to remembrance,
c56304	ye shall be taken with the hand.
c56305	And thou,
c56306	profane wicked prince of Israel,
c56307	whose day is come, when iniquity <i>shall have</i> an end,
c56308	Thus saith the Lord GOD;
c56309	Remove the diadem,
c56310	and take off the crown:
c56311	this <i>shall</i> not <i>be</i> the same:
c56312	exalt <i>him that is</i> low,
c56313	and abase <i>him that is</i> high.
c56314	I will overturn, overturn, overturn,
c56315	it: and it shall be no
c56316	<i>more,</i> until he come
c56317	whose right
c56318	it is; and I will give it <i>him.</i>
c56319	And thou,
c56320	son of man,
c56321	prophesy
c56322	and say,
c56323	Thus saith the Lord GOD concerning the Ammonites, and concerning their reproach;
c56324	even say
c56325	thou, The sword, the sword
c56326	<i>is</i> drawn: for the slaughter
c56327	<i>it is</i> furbished,
c56328	to consume
c56329	because of the glittering:
c56330	Whiles they see vanity
c56331	unto thee, whiles they divine a lie
c56332	unto thee, to bring thee upon the necks of <i>them that are</i> slain, of the wicked,
c56333	whose day is come, when their iniquity <i>shall have</i> an end.
c56334	Shall I cause <i>it</i> to return into his sheath?
c56336	where thou wast created, in the land of thy nativity.
c56337	I will judge thee in the place
c56338	And I will pour out mine indignation upon
c56339	thee, I will blow against thee in the fire of my wrath,
c56340	and deliver thee into the hand of brutish men, <i>and</i> skilful to destroy.
c56341	Thou shalt be for fuel to the fire;
c56342	thy blood shall be in the midst of the land;
c56343	thou shalt be no <i>more</i> remembered:
c56344	for I the LORD have spoken <i>it.</i>
c56345	Moreover the word of the LORD came unto
c56346	me, saying,
c56347	Now, thou
c56348	son of man,
c56349	wilt thou judge,
c56350	wilt thou judge the bloody city?
c56351	yea, thou shalt shew her all her abominations.
c56352	Then say
c56353	thou, Thus saith the Lord GOD,
c56354	The city
c56355	sheddeth blood in the midst
c56356	of it, that her time may come,
c56357	and maketh idols against
c56358	herself to defile herself.
c56359	in thy blood
c56360	that thou hast shed;
c56361	Thou art become guilty
c56362	thyself in thine idols
c56363	which thou hast made;
c56364	and hast defiled
c56365	and thou hast caused thy days to draw near,
c56366	and art come <i>even</i> unto thy years:
c56367	therefore have I made thee a reproach unto the heathen,
c56368	and a mocking to all countries.
c56369	<i>Those that be</i> near,
c56370	and <i>those that be</i> far from
c56371	thee, shall mock
c56372	thee, <i>which art</i> infamous <i>and</i> much vexed.
c56373	Behold, the princes of Israel,
c56374	every one were in thee to their power
c56376	to shed blood.
c56377	In thee have they set light by father and mother:
c56378	in the midst of thee have they dealt by oppression with the stranger:
c56379	in thee have they vexed the fatherless and the widow.
c56380	Thou hast despised mine holy things,
c56381	and hast profaned my sabbaths.
c56382	In thee are men that carry tales
c56383	to shed blood:
c56384	and in thee they eat upon the mountains:
c56385	in the midst of thee they commit lewdness.
c56386	In thee have they discovered their fathers' nakedness:
c56387	in thee have they humbled her that was set apart for pollution.
c56388	And one hath committed abomination with his neighbour's wife;
c56389	and another hath lewdly defiled his daughter in law;
c56390	and another in thee hath humbled his sister, his father's daughter.
c56391	In thee have they taken gifts
c56392	to shed blood;
c56393	thou hast taken usury and increase,
c56394	and thou hast greedily gained of thy neighbours by extortion,
c56395	and hast forgotten
c56396	me, saith the Lord GOD.
c56397	Behold, therefore I have smitten mine hand at thy dishonest gain
c56398	which thou hast made,
c56399	and at thy blood
c56400	which hath been in the midst of thee.
c56401	Can thine heart endure,
c56402	or can thine hands be strong, in the days
c56403	that I shall deal
c56404	with thee? I the LORD have spoken
c56405	<i>it,</i> and will do <i>it.</i>
c56406	And I will scatter thee among the heathen,
c56407	and disperse thee in the countries,
c56408	and will consume thy filthiness out of thee.
c56409	And thou shalt take thine inheritance in thyself in the sight of the heathen,
c56410	and thou shalt know
c56411	that I <i>am</i> the LORD.
c56412	And the word of the LORD came unto
c56413	me, saying,
c56414	Son of man,
c56415	the house of Israel is to me become dross:
c56416	all they <i>are</i> brass, and tin, and iron, and lead, in the midst of the furnace;
c56417	they are <i>even</i> the dross of silver.
c56418	Therefore
c56419	thus saith the Lord GOD;
c56420	Because ye are all become dross,
c56421	behold, therefore I will gather you into the midst of Jerusalem.
c56422	<i>As</i> they gather silver, and brass, and iron, and lead, and tin, into the midst of the furnace,
c56423	to blow the fire upon
c56424	it, to melt
c56425	<i>it;</i> so will I gather <i>you</i> in mine anger and in my fury,
c56426	and I will leave
c56427	<i>you there,</i> and melt you.
c56428	Yea, I will gather
c56429	you, and blow upon you in the fire of my wrath,
c56430	and ye shall be melted in the midst thereof.
c56431	As silver is melted in the midst of the furnace,
c56432	so shall ye be melted in the midst
c56433	thereof; and ye shall know
c56434	that I the LORD have poured out my fury upon you.
c56435	And the word of the LORD came unto
c56436	me, saying,
c56437	Son of man,
c56438	say
c56439	unto her, Thou <i>art</i> the land
c56440	that is not cleansed,
c56441	nor rained upon in the day of indignation.
c56442	<i>There is</i> a conspiracy of her prophets in the midst thereof, like a roaring lion
c56443	ravening the prey;
c56444	they have devoured souls;
c56445	they have taken the treasure and precious things;
c56446	they have made her many widows in the midst thereof.
c56447	Her priests have violated my law,
c56448	and have profaned mine holy things:
c56449	they have put no difference between the holy and profane,
c56450	neither have they shewed <i>difference</i> between the unclean and the clean,
c56451	and have hid their eyes from my sabbaths,
c56452	and I am profaned among them.
c56453	Her princes in the midst
c56454	thereof <i>are</i> like wolves ravening the prey,
c56455	to shed blood,
c56456	<i>and</i> to destroy souls,
c56457	to get dishonest gain.
c56458	And her prophets have daubed them with untempered
c56459	<i>morter,</i> seeing vanity,
c56460	and divining lies
c56461	unto them, saying,
c56462	Thus saith the Lord GOD,
c56463	when the LORD hath not spoken.
c56464	The people of the land have used oppression,
c56465	and exercised robbery,
c56466	and have vexed the poor and needy:
c56467	yea, they have oppressed the stranger wrongfully.
c56468	And I sought for a man among
c56469	them, that should make up the hedge,
c56470	and stand in the gap before me for the land,
c56471	that I should not destroy
c56472	it: but I found none.
c56473	Therefore have I poured out mine indignation upon
c56474	them; I have consumed them with the fire of my wrath:
c56475	their own way have I recompensed upon their heads,
c56476	saith the Lord GOD.
c56477	The word of the LORD came again unto
c56478	me, saying,
c56479	Son of man,
c56480	there were two women, the daughters of one mother:
c56481	And they committed whoredoms in Egypt;
c56482	they committed whoredoms in their youth:
c56483	there were their breasts pressed,
c56484	and there they bruised the teats of their virginity.
c56485	And the names
c56486	of them <i>were</i> Aholah the elder,
c56487	and Aholibah her sister:
c56488	and they were
c56489	mine, and they bare sons and daughters.
c56490	Thus <i>were</i> their names;
c56491	Samaria <i>is</i> Aholah,
c56492	and Jerusalem Aholibah.
c56493	And Aholah played the harlot when she was
c56494	mine; and she doted on her lovers, on the Assyrians <i>her</i> neighbours,
c56495	<i>Which were</i> clothed with blue,
c56496	captains and rulers,
c56497	all of them desirable young men,
c56498	horsemen
c56499	riding upon horses.
c56500	Thus she committed her whoredoms with
c56501	them, with all them <i>that were</i> the chosen men of Assyria,
c56502	and with all
c56503	on whom she doted:
c56504	with all their idols she defiled herself.
c56505	Neither left she her whoredoms <i>brought</i> from Egypt:
c56506	for in her youth they lay with
c56507	her, and they bruised the breasts of her virginity,
c56508	and poured their whoredom upon her.
c56509	Wherefore I have delivered her into the hand of her lovers, into the hand of the Assyrians,
c56510	upon whom she doted.
c56511	These discovered her nakedness:
c56512	they took her sons and her daughters,
c56513	and slew her with the sword:
c56514	and she became famous among women;
c56515	for they had executed judgment upon her.
c56516	And when her sister Aholibah saw
c56517	<i>this,</i> she was more corrupt in her inordinate love than
c56518	she, and in her whoredoms more than her sister in <i>her</i> whoredoms.
c56519	She doted upon the Assyrians
c56520	<i>her</i> neighbours, captains and rulers
c56521	clothed most gorgeously,
c56522	horsemen
c56523	riding upon horses,
c56524	all of them desirable young men.
c56525	Then I saw
c56526	that she was defiled,
c56527	<i>that</i> they <i>took</i> both one way,
c56528	And <i>that</i> she increased her whoredoms:
c56529	for when she saw men
c56530	pourtrayed upon the wall,
c56531	the images of the Chaldeans
c56532	pourtrayed with vermilion,
c56533	Girded with girdles upon their loins,
c56534	exceeding in dyed attire upon their heads,
c56535	all of them princes to look to, after the manner of the Babylonians of Chaldea, the land of their nativity:
c56536	And as soon as she saw them with her eyes, she doted upon
c56537	them, and sent messengers unto them into Chaldea.
c56538	And the Babylonians came to her into the bed of love,
c56539	and they defiled her with their whoredom,
c56540	and she was polluted
c56541	with them, and her mind was alienated from them.
c56542	So she discovered her whoredoms,
c56543	and discovered her nakedness:
c56544	then my mind was alienated from
c56545	her, like as my mind was alienated from her sister.
c56546	Yet she multiplied her whoredoms,
c56547	in calling to remembrance the days of her youth,
c56548	wherein she had played the harlot in the land of Egypt.
c56549	For she doted upon their paramours,
c56550	whose flesh <i>is as</i> the flesh of asses,
c56551	and whose issue <i>is like</i> the issue of horses.
c56552	Thus thou calledst to remembrance the lewdness of thy youth,
c56553	in bruising thy teats by the Egyptians for the paps of thy youth.
c56554	Therefore,
c56555	O Aholibah,
c56556	thus saith the Lord GOD;
c56557	Behold, I will raise up thy lovers against
c56558	thee, from whom thy mind is alienated,
c56559	and I will bring them against thee on every side;
c56560	The Babylonians, and all the Chaldeans, Pekod, and Shoa, and Koa,
c56561	<i>and</i> all the Assyrians with
c56563	them: all of them desirable young men, captains and rulers,
c56564	great lords and renowned,
c56565	all of them riding upon horses.
c56566	And they shall come against thee with chariots, wagons, and wheels,
c56567	and with an assembly of people,
c56568	<i>which</i> shall set against thee buckler and shield and helmet round about:
c56569	and I will set judgment before
c56570	them, and they shall judge thee according to their judgments.
c56571	And I will set my jealousy
c56572	against thee, and they shall deal furiously with
c56573	thee: they shall take away thy nose and thine ears;
c56574	and thy remnant shall fall by the sword:
c56575	they shall take thy sons and thy daughters;
c56576	and thy residue shall be devoured by the fire.
c56577	They shall also strip thee out of thy clothes,
c56578	and take away thy fair jewels.
c56579	Thus will I make thy lewdness to cease from
c56580	thee, and thy whoredom <i>brought</i> from the land of Egypt:
c56581	so that thou shalt not lift up thine eyes unto
c56582	them, nor remember Egypt any more.
c56583	For thus saith the Lord GOD;
c56584	Behold, I will deliver thee into the hand
c56585	<i>of them</i> whom thou hatest,
c56586	into the hand
c56587	<i>of them</i> from whom thy mind is alienated:
c56588	And they shall deal with thee hatefully,
c56589	and shall take away all thy labour,
c56590	and shall leave thee naked and bare:
c56591	and the nakedness of thy whoredoms shall be discovered, both thy lewdness and thy whoredoms.
c56592	I will do these
c56593	<i>things</i> unto thee, because thou hast gone a whoring after the heathen,
c56594	<i>and</i> because thou art polluted with their idols.
c56595	Thou hast walked in the way of thy sister;
c56596	therefore will I give her cup into thine hand.
c56597	Thus saith the Lord GOD;
c56598	Thou shalt drink of thy sister's cup deep and large:
c56599	thou shalt be laughed to scorn and had in derision;
c56600	much.
c56601	it containeth
c56602	Thou shalt be filled with drunkenness and sorrow,
c56603	with the cup of astonishment and desolation, with the cup of thy sister Samaria.
c56604	Thou shalt even drink
c56605	it and suck <i>it</i> out,
c56606	and thou shalt break the sherds
c56607	thereof, and pluck off thine own breasts:
c56608	for I have spoken
c56609	<i>it,</i> saith the Lord GOD.
c56610	Therefore
c56611	thus saith the Lord GOD;
c56612	Because thou hast forgotten
c56613	me, and cast me behind thy back,
c56614	therefore bear thou also thy lewdness and thy whoredoms.
c56615	The LORD said moreover unto
c56616	me; Son of man,
c56617	wilt thou judge Aholah and Aholibah?
c56618	yea, declare unto them their abominations;
c56619	That they have committed adultery,
c56620	and blood <i>is</i> in their hands,
c56621	and with their idols have they committed adultery,
c56622	and have also caused their sons,
c56623	whom they bare
c56624	unto me, to pass for them through <i>the fire,</i> to devour <i>them.</i>
c56625	Moreover this they have done
c56626	unto me: they have defiled my sanctuary in the same day,
c56627	and have profaned my sabbaths.
c56628	For when they had slain their children to their idols,
c56629	then they came the same day into my sanctuary
c56630	to profane
c56631	it; and, lo, thus have they done in the midst of mine house.
c56632	And furthermore, that ye have sent for men
c56633	to come from far,
c56634	unto whom a messenger <i>was</i> sent;
c56635	and, lo, they came:
c56636	for whom thou didst wash
c56637	thyself, paintedst thy eyes,
c56638	and deckedst thyself with ornaments,
c56639	And satest upon a stately bed,
c56640	and a table prepared before
c56641	it, whereupon thou hast set mine incense and mine oil.
c56642	And a voice of a multitude being at ease
c56643	<i>was</i> with her: and with the men of the common sort <i>were</i> brought Sabeans from the wilderness,
c56644	which put bracelets upon their hands, and beautiful crowns upon
c56645	their heads.
c56646	Then said I unto <i>her that was</i> old in adulteries,
c56647	Will they now commit whoredoms
c56648	with her, and she <i>with them?</i>
c56649	Yet they went in unto
c56650	her, as they go in unto a woman that playeth the harlot:
c56651	so went they in unto Aholah and unto Aholibah, the lewd women.
c56652	And the righteous men,
c56653	they shall judge them after the manner of adulteresses, and after the manner of women that shed blood;
c56654	because they <i>are</i> adulteresses,
c56655	and blood <i>is</i> in their hands.
c56656	For thus saith the Lord GOD;
c56657	I will bring up a company upon
c56658	them, and will give them to be removed and spoiled.
c56659	And the company shall stone them with stones,
c56660	and dispatch them with their swords;
c56661	they shall slay their sons and their daughters,
c56662	and burn up their houses with fire.
c56663	Thus will I cause lewdness to cease out of the land,
c56664	that all women may be taught
c56665	not to do after your lewdness.
c56666	And they shall recompense your lewdness upon
c56667	you, and ye shall bear the sins of your idols:
c56668	and ye shall know
c56669	that I <i>am</i> the Lord GOD.
c56670	Again in the ninth year, in the tenth month, in the tenth <i>day</i> of the month, the word of the LORD came unto
c56671	me, saying,
c56672	Son of man,
c56673	write thee the name of the day,
c56674	<i>even</i> of this same day:
c56675	the king of Babylon set himself against Jerusalem this same day.
c56676	And utter a parable unto the rebellious house,
c56677	and say unto
c56678	them, Thus saith the Lord GOD;
c56679	Set on a pot,
c56680	set <i>it</i> on,
c56681	and also pour water into it:
c56682	Gather the pieces thereof into it, <i>even</i> every good piece, the thigh, and the shoulder;
c56683	fill <i>it</i> with the choice bones.
c56684	Take the choice of the flock,
c56685	and burn also the bones under
c56686	it, <i>and</i> make it boil well,
c56687	and let them seethe the bones of it therein.
c56688	Wherefore
c56689	thus saith the Lord GOD;
c56690	Woe to the bloody city,
c56691	to the pot
c56692	whose scum
c56693	<i>is</i> therein, and whose scum is not gone out of
c56694	it! bring it out piece by piece;
c56695	let no lot fall upon it.
c56696	For her blood is in the midst
c56697	of her; she set it upon the top of a rock;
c56698	she poured it not upon the ground,
c56699	to cover it with dust;
c56700	That it might cause fury to come up
c56701	to take vengeance;
c56702	I have set her blood upon the top of a rock,
c56703	that it should not be covered.
c56704	Therefore
c56705	thus saith the Lord GOD;
c56706	Woe to the bloody city!
c56707	I will even make the pile for fire great.
c56708	Heap on wood,
c56709	kindle the fire,
c56710	consume the flesh,
c56711	and spice it well,
c56712	and let the bones be burned.
c56713	Then set it empty upon the coals
c56714	thereof, that the brass of it may be hot,
c56715	and may burn,
c56716	and <i>that</i> the filthiness of it may be molten in
c56717	it, <i>that</i> the scum of it may be consumed.
c56718	She hath wearied <i>herself</i> with lies,
c56719	and her great scum went not forth out of
c56720	her: her scum <i>shall be</i> in the fire.
c56721	In thy filthiness <i>is</i> lewdness:
c56722	because I have purged
c56723	thee, and thou wast not purged, thou shalt not be purged from thy filthiness
c56724	any more,
c56725	till I have caused my fury to rest upon thee.
c56726	I the LORD have spoken
c56727	<i>it:</i> it shall come to pass,
c56728	and I will do
c56729	<i>it;</i> I will not go back,
c56730	neither will I spare,
c56731	neither will I repent;
c56732	according to thy ways, and according to thy doings, shall they judge
c56733	thee, saith the Lord GOD.
c56734	Also the word of the LORD came unto
c56735	me, saying,
c56736	Son of man,
c56737	behold, I take away from thee the desire of thine eyes with a stroke:
c56738	yet neither shalt thou mourn
c56739	nor weep,
c56740	neither shall thy tears run down.
c56741	to cry,
c56742	Forbear
c56743	make no mourning for the dead,
c56744	bind the tire of thine head upon
c56745	thee, and put on thy shoes upon thy feet,
c56746	and cover not <i>thy</i> lips,
c56747	and eat not the bread of men.
c56748	So I spake unto the people in the morning:
c56749	and at even my wife died;
c56750	and I did in the morning
c56751	as I was commanded.
c56752	And the people said unto
c56753	me, Wilt thou not tell
c56754	us what these
c56755	<i>things are</i> to us, that thou doest <i>so?</i>
c56756	Then I answered
c56757	them, The word of the LORD came unto
c56758	me, saying,
c56759	Speak unto the house of Israel,
c56760	Thus saith the Lord GOD;
c56761	Behold, I will profane my sanctuary, the excellency of your strength, the desire of your eyes, and that which your soul pitieth;
c56762	and your sons and your daughters
c56763	whom ye have left
c56764	shall fall by the sword.
c56765	And ye shall do
c56766	as I have done:
c56767	ye shall not cover <i>your</i> lips,
c56768	nor eat the bread of men.
c56769	And your tires <i>shall be</i> upon your heads,
c56770	and your shoes upon your feet:
c56771	ye shall not mourn
c56772	nor weep;
c56773	but ye shall pine away for your iniquities,
c56774	and mourn
c56775	one toward another.
c56776	Thus Ezekiel is unto you a sign:
c56777	according to all
c56778	that he hath done
c56779	shall ye do:
c56780	and when this cometh,
c56781	ye shall know
c56782	that I <i>am</i> the Lord GOD.
c56783	Also, thou
c56784	son of man,
c56785	<i>shall it</i> not <i>be</i> in the day
c56786	when I take from them their strength, the joy of their glory, the desire of their eyes, and that whereupon they set their minds, their sons and their daughters,
c56787	<i>That</i> he that escapeth in that day shall come unto thee, to cause <i>thee</i> to hear <i>it</i> with <i>thine</i> ears?
c56788	In that day shall thy mouth be opened to him which is escaped,
c56789	and thou shalt speak,
c56790	and be no more dumb:
c56791	and thou shalt be a sign
c56792	unto them; and they shall know
c56793	that I <i>am</i> the LORD.
c56794	The word of the LORD came again unto
c56795	me, saying,
c56796	Son of man,
c56797	set thy face against the Ammonites,
c56798	and prophesy against them;
c56799	And say unto the Ammonites,
c56800	Hear the word of the Lord GOD;
c56801	Thus saith the Lord GOD;
c56802	Because thou saidst,
c56803	Aha,
c56804	against my sanctuary,
c56805	when it was profaned;
c56806	and against the land of Israel,
c56807	when it was desolate;
c56808	and against the house of Judah,
c56809	when they went into captivity;
c56811	Behold, therefore I will deliver thee to the men of the east for a possession,
c56812	and they shall set their palaces
c56813	in thee, and make their dwellings
c56814	in thee: they shall eat thy fruit,
c56815	and they shall drink thy milk.
c56816	And I will make Rabbah a stable for camels,
c56817	and the Ammonites a couchingplace for flocks:
c56818	and ye shall know
c56819	that I <i>am</i> the LORD.
c56820	For thus saith the Lord GOD;
c56821	Because thou hast clapped <i>thine</i> hands,
c56822	and stamped with the feet,
c56823	and rejoiced in heart with all thy despite against the land of Israel;
c56825	Behold, therefore I will stretch out mine hand upon
c56826	thee, and will deliver thee for a spoil to the heathen;
c56827	and I will cut thee off from the people,
c56828	and I will cause thee to perish out of the countries:
c56829	I will destroy
c56830	thee; and thou shalt know
c56831	that I <i>am</i> the LORD.
c56832	Thus saith the Lord GOD;
c56833	Because that Moab and Seir do say,
c56834	Behold, the house of Judah <i>is</i> like unto all the heathen;
c56835	Therefore,
c56836	behold, I will open the side of Moab from the cities, from his cities <i>which are</i> on his frontiers,
c56837	the glory of the country, Bethjeshimoth, Baalmeon, and Kiriathaim,
c56838	Unto the men of the east with the Ammonites,
c56839	and will give them in possession,
c56840	that the Ammonites may not be remembered among the nations.
c56841	And I will execute judgments upon Moab;
c56842	and they shall know
c56843	that I <i>am</i> the LORD.
c56844	Thus saith the Lord GOD;
c56845	Because that Edom hath dealt
c56846	against the house of Judah by taking vengeance,
c56847	and hath greatly offended,
c56848	and revenged himself upon them;
c56849	Therefore
c56850	thus saith the Lord GOD;
c56851	I will also stretch out mine hand upon Edom,
c56852	and will cut off man and beast from
c56853	it; and I will make it desolate from Teman; and they of Dedan
c56854	shall fall by the sword.
c56855	And I will lay my vengeance upon Edom by the hand of my people Israel:
c56856	and they shall do in Edom according to mine anger and according to my fury;
c56857	and they shall know my vengeance,
c56858	saith the Lord GOD.
c56859	Thus saith the Lord GOD;
c56860	Because the Philistines have dealt by revenge,
c56861	and have taken vengeance with a despiteful heart, to destroy <i>it</i> for the old hatred;
c56862	Therefore
c56863	thus saith the Lord GOD;
c56864	Behold, I will stretch out mine hand upon the Philistines,
c56865	and I will cut off the Cherethims,
c56866	and destroy the remnant of the sea coast.
c56867	And I will execute great vengeance upon them with furious rebukes;
c56868	and they shall know
c56869	that I <i>am</i> the LORD,
c56870	when I shall lay my vengeance upon them.
c56871	And it came to pass in the eleventh year, in the first <i>day</i> of the month,
c56872	<i>that</i> the word of the LORD came unto
c56873	me, saying,
c56874	Son of man,
c56875	because that Tyrus hath said against Jerusalem,
c56876	Aha,
c56877	she is broken <i>that was</i> the gates of the people:
c56878	she is turned unto
c56879	me: I shall be replenished,
c56880	<i>now</i> she is laid waste:
c56881	Therefore
c56882	thus saith the Lord GOD;
c56883	Behold, I <i>am</i> against
c56884	thee, O Tyrus,
c56885	and will cause many nations to come up against
c56886	thee, as the sea causeth his waves to come up.
c56887	And they shall destroy the walls of Tyrus,
c56888	and break down her towers:
c56889	I will also scrape her dust from
c56890	her, and make her like the top of a rock.
c56891	It shall be <i>a place for</i> the spreading of nets in the midst of the sea:
c56892	for I have spoken
c56893	<i>it,</i> saith the Lord GOD:
c56894	and it shall become a spoil to the nations.
c56895	And her daughters
c56896	which <i>are</i> in the field
c56897	shall be slain by the sword;
c56898	and they shall know
c56899	that I <i>am</i> the LORD.
c56900	For thus saith the Lord GOD;
c56901	Behold, I will bring upon Tyrus Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, a king of kings, from the north, with horses, and with chariots, and with horsemen, and companies, and much people.
c56902	He shall slay with the sword thy daughters in the field:
c56903	and he shall make a fort against
c56904	thee, and cast a mount against
c56905	thee, and lift up the buckler against thee.
c56906	And he shall set engines of war against thy walls,
c56907	and with his axes he shall break down thy towers.
c56908	By reason of the abundance of his horses their dust shall cover
c56909	thee: thy walls shall shake at the noise of the horsemen, and of the wheels, and of the chariots,
c56910	when he shall enter into thy gates, as men enter into a city wherein is made a breach.
c56911	With the hoofs of his horses shall he tread down all thy streets:
c56912	he shall slay thy people by the sword,
c56913	and thy strong garrisons shall go down to the ground.
c56914	And they shall make a spoil of thy riches,
c56915	and make a prey of thy merchandise:
c56916	and they shall break down thy walls,
c56917	and destroy thy pleasant houses:
c56918	and they shall lay thy stones and thy timber and thy dust in the midst of the water.
c56919	And I will cause the noise of thy songs to cease;
c56920	and the sound of thy harps shall be no more heard.
c56921	And I will make thee like the top of a rock:
c56922	thou shalt be <i>a place</i> to spread nets upon;
c56923	thou shalt be built no more:
c56924	for I the LORD have spoken <i>it,</i> saith the Lord GOD.
c56926	Thus saith the Lord GOD to Tyrus;
c56927	Shall not the isles shake at the sound of thy fall,
c56928	when the wounded cry,
c56929	when the slaughter is made in the midst of thee?
c56931	Then all the princes of the sea shall come down from their thrones,
c56932	and lay away their robes,
c56933	and put off their broidered garments:
c56934	they shall clothe themselves with trembling;
c56935	they shall sit upon the ground,
c56936	and shall tremble at <i>every</i> moment,
c56937	and be astonished at thee.
c56938	And they shall take up a lamentation for
c56939	thee, and say
c56940	to thee, How art thou destroyed,
c56941	<i>that wast</i> inhabited of seafaring men,
c56942	city,
c56943	the renowned
c56944	which wast strong in the sea, she and her inhabitants,
c56945	which cause their terror <i>to be</i> on all that haunt it!
c56946	Now shall the isles tremble in the day of thy fall;
c56947	yea, the isles that <i>are</i> in the sea shall be troubled
c56949	at thy departure.
c56950	For thus saith the Lord GOD;
c56951	When I shall make
c56952	thee a desolate city,
c56953	like the cities
c56954	that are not inhabited;
c56955	when I shall bring up the deep upon
c56956	thee, and great waters shall cover thee;
c56957	When I shall bring thee down with them that descend into the pit, with the people of old time,
c56958	and shall set thee in the low parts of the earth, in places desolate of old, with them that go down to the pit,
c56959	that thou be not inhabited;
c56960	and I shall set glory in the land of the living;
c56961	I will make thee a terror,
c56962	and thou <i>shalt be</i> no
c56963	<i>more:</i> though thou be sought for,
c56964	yet shalt thou never be found again,
c56965	saith the Lord GOD.
c56966	The word of the LORD came again unto
c56967	me, saying,
c56968	Now, thou
c56969	son of man,
c56970	take up a lamentation for Tyrus;
c56971	And say unto Tyrus,
c56972	O thou that art situate at the entry of the sea,
c56973	<i>which art</i> a merchant of the people for many isles,
c56974	Thus saith the Lord GOD;
c56975	O Tyrus,
c56976	thou hast said,
c56977	I <i>am</i> of perfect beauty.
c56978	Thy borders <i>are</i> in the midst of the seas,
c56979	thy builders have perfected thy beauty.
c56980	They have made all thy <i>ship</i> boards of fir trees of Senir:
c56981	they have taken cedars from Lebanon
c56982	to make masts for thee.
c56983	<i>Of</i> the oaks of Bashan have they made thine oars;
c56984	the company of the Ashurites have made thy benches <i>of</i> ivory, <i>brought</i> out of the isles of Chittim.
c56985	Fine linen with broidered work from Egypt was that which thou spreadest forth
c56986	to be thy sail;
c56987	blue and purple from the isles of Elishah was that which covered thee.
c56988	The inhabitants of Zidon and Arvad were thy mariners:
c56989	thy wise
c56990	<i>men,</i> O Tyrus,
c56991	<i>that</i> were
c56992	in thee, were thy pilots.
c56993	The ancients of Gebal and the wise <i>men</i> thereof were
c56994	in thee thy calkers:
c56995	all the ships of the sea with their mariners were
c56996	in thee to occupy thy merchandise.
c56997	They of Persia and of Lud and of Phut were in thine army, thy men of war:
c56998	they hanged the shield and helmet
c56999	in thee; they set forth thy comeliness.
c57000	The men of Arvad with thine army <i>were</i> upon thy walls round about,
c57001	and the Gammadims were in thy towers:
c57002	they hanged their shields upon thy walls round about;
c57003	they have made thy beauty perfect.
c57004	Tarshish <i>was</i> thy merchant by reason of the multitude of all <i>kind of</i> riches;
c57005	with silver, iron, tin, and lead, they traded in thy fairs.
c57006	Javan, Tubal, and Meshech,
c57007	they <i>were</i> thy merchants:
c57008	they traded the persons of men and vessels of brass in thy market.
c57009	They of the house of Togarmah traded in thy fairs with horses and horsemen and mules.
c57010	The men of Dedan <i>were</i> thy merchants;
c57011	many isles <i>were</i> the merchandise of thine hand:
c57012	they brought thee <i>for</i> a present horns of ivory and ebony.
c57013	Syria <i>was</i> thy merchant by reason of the multitude of the wares of thy making:
c57014	they occupied in thy fairs with emeralds, purple, and broidered work, and fine linen, and coral, and agate.
c57015	Judah, and the land of Israel,
c57016	they <i>were</i> thy merchants:
c57017	they traded in thy market wheat of Minnith, and Pannag, and honey, and oil, and balm.
c57018	Damascus <i>was</i> thy merchant in the multitude of the wares of thy making,
c57019	for the multitude of all riches; in the wine of Helbon, and white wool.
c57020	Dan also and Javan going to and fro occupied in thy fairs: bright iron,
c57021	cassia, and calamus, were in thy market.
c57022	Dedan <i>was</i> thy merchant in precious clothes for chariots.
c57023	Arabia, and all the princes of Kedar,
c57024	they occupied with
c57025	thee in lambs, and rams, and goats:
c57026	in these <i>were they</i> thy merchants.
c57027	The merchants of Sheba and Raamah,
c57028	they <i>were</i> thy merchants:
c57029	they occupied in thy fairs with chief of all spices, and with all precious stones, and gold.
c57030	Haran, and Canneh, and Eden, the merchants of Sheba,
c57031	Asshur, <i>and</i> Chilmad, <i>were</i> thy merchants.
c57032	These <i>were</i> thy merchants in all sorts <i>of things,</i> in blue clothes, and broidered work, and in chests of rich apparel, bound with cords, and made of cedar, among thy merchandise.
c57033	The ships of Tarshish did sing of thee in thy market:
c57034	and thou wast replenished,
c57035	and made very glorious in the midst of the seas.
c57036	have brought thee into great waters:
c57037	Thy rowers
c57038	the east wind hath broken thee in the midst of the seas.
c57039	Thy riches, and thy fairs, thy merchandise, thy mariners, and thy pilots, thy calkers, and the occupiers of thy merchandise, and all thy men of war,
c57040	that
c57041	<i>are</i> in thee, and in all thy company
c57042	which <i>is</i> in the midst
c57043	of thee, shall fall into the midst of the seas in the day of thy ruin.
c57044	The suburbs shall shake at the sound of the cry of thy pilots.
c57045	And all that handle the oar, the mariners, <i>and</i> all the pilots of the sea, shall come down from their ships,
c57046	they shall stand upon the land;
c57047	And shall cause their voice to be heard against
c57048	thee, and shall cry bitterly,
c57049	and shall cast up dust upon their heads,
c57050	they shall wallow themselves in the ashes:
c57051	And they shall make themselves utterly bald for
c57052	thee, and gird them with sackcloth,
c57053	and they shall weep for thee with bitterness of heart <i>and</i> bitter wailing.
c57054	And in their wailing they shall take up a lamentation for
c57055	thee, and lament over
c57056	thee, <i>saying,</i> What <i>city is</i> like Tyrus,
c57057	like the destroyed in the midst of the sea?
c57058	When thy wares went forth out of the seas,
c57059	thou filledst many people;
c57060	thou didst enrich the kings of the earth with the multitude of thy riches and of thy merchandise.
c57061	In the time
c57062	<i>when</i> thou shalt be broken by the seas in the depths of the waters
c57063	thy merchandise and all thy company in the midst of thee shall fall.
c57064	All the inhabitants of the isles shall be astonished at
c57065	thee, and their kings shall be sore afraid,
c57066	they shall be troubled in <i>their</i> countenance.
c57067	The merchants among the people shall hiss at
c57068	thee; thou shalt be a terror,
c57069	and never <i>shalt be</i> any more.
c57070	The word of the LORD came again unto
c57071	me, saying,
c57072	Son of man,
c57073	say unto the prince of Tyrus,
c57074	Thus saith the Lord GOD;
c57075	Because thine heart <i>is</i> lifted up,
c57076	and thou hast said,
c57077	I <i>am</i> a God,
c57078	I sit <i>in</i> the seat of God, in the midst of the seas;
c57079	yet thou <i>art</i> a man,
c57080	and not God,
c57081	though thou set thine heart as the heart of God:
c57082	Behold, thou <i>art</i> wiser than Daniel;
c57083	there is no secret that they can hide from thee:
c57084	With thy wisdom and with thine understanding thou hast gotten thee riches,
c57085	and hast gotten gold and silver into thy treasures:
c57086	By thy great wisdom <i>and</i> by thy traffick hast thou increased thy riches,
c57087	and thine heart is lifted up because of thy riches:
c57088	Therefore
c57089	thus saith the Lord GOD;
c57090	Because thou hast set thine heart as the heart of God;
c57092	Behold, therefore I will bring strangers upon thee, the terrible of the nations:
c57093	and they shall draw their swords against the beauty of thy wisdom,
c57094	and they shall defile thy brightness.
c57095	They shall bring thee down to the pit,
c57096	and thou shalt die the deaths of <i>them that are</i> slain in the midst of the seas.
c57097	Wilt thou yet say
c57098	thee, I <i>am</i> God?
c57099	before him that slayeth
c57100	but thou <i>shalt be</i> a man,
c57101	and no God,
c57102	in the hand of him that slayeth thee.
c57103	Thou shalt die the deaths of the uncircumcised by the hand of strangers:
c57104	for I have spoken
c57105	<i>it,</i> saith the Lord GOD.
c57106	Moreover the word of the LORD came unto
c57107	me, saying,
c57108	Son of man,
c57109	take up a lamentation upon the king of Tyrus,
c57110	and say
c57111	unto him, Thus saith the Lord GOD;
c57112	Thou sealest up the sum,
c57113	full of wisdom, and perfect in beauty.
c57114	Thou hast been in Eden the garden of God;
c57115	every precious stone <i>was</i> thy covering,
c57116	the sardius, topaz, and the diamond, the beryl, the onyx, and the jasper, the sapphire, the emerald, and the carbuncle,
c57117	and gold: the workmanship of thy tabrets and of thy pipes
c57118	in thee in the day
c57119	that thou wast created.
c57120	was prepared
c57121	Thou <i>art</i> the anointed cherub that covereth;
c57122	and I have set
c57123	thee <i>so:</i> thou wast upon the holy mountain of God;
c57124	thou hast walked up and down in the midst of the stones of fire.
c57125	Thou <i>wast</i> perfect in thy ways from the day
c57126	that thou wast created,
c57127	till iniquity was found in thee.
c57128	By the multitude of thy merchandise they have filled the midst of thee with violence,
c57129	and thou hast sinned:
c57130	therefore I will cast thee as profane out of the mountain of God:
c57131	and I will destroy
c57132	cherub,
c57133	thee, O covering
c57134	from the midst of the stones of fire.
c57135	Thine heart was lifted up because of thy beauty,
c57136	thou hast corrupted thy wisdom by reason of thy brightness:
c57137	I will cast thee to the ground,
c57138	I will lay thee before kings,
c57139	that they may behold thee.
c57140	Thou hast defiled thy sanctuaries by the multitude of thine iniquities, by the iniquity of thy traffick;
c57141	therefore will I bring forth a fire from the midst
c57142	of thee, it shall devour
c57143	thee, and I will bring thee to ashes upon the earth in the sight of all them that behold thee.
c57144	All they that know thee among the people shall be astonished at
c57145	thee: thou shalt be a terror,
c57146	and never <i>shalt</i> thou <i>be</i> any more.
c57147	Again the word of the LORD came unto
c57148	me, saying,
c57149	Son of man,
c57150	set thy face against Zidon,
c57151	and prophesy against it,
c57152	And say,
c57153	Thus saith the Lord GOD;
c57154	Behold, I <i>am</i> against
c57155	thee, O Zidon;
c57156	and I will be glorified in the midst
c57157	of thee: and they shall know
c57158	that I <i>am</i> the LORD,
c57159	when I shall have executed judgments
c57160	in her, and shall be sanctified in her.
c57161	For I will send into her pestilence, and blood into her streets;
c57162	and the wounded shall be judged in the midst of her by the sword upon her on every side;
c57163	and they shall know
c57164	that I <i>am</i> the LORD.
c57165	And there shall be no more a pricking brier unto the house of Israel, nor <i>any</i> grieving thorn of all <i>that are</i> round about
c57166	them, that despised
c57167	them; and they shall know
c57168	that I <i>am</i> the Lord GOD.
c57169	Thus saith the Lord GOD;
c57170	When I shall have gathered the house of Israel from the people
c57171	among whom they are scattered,
c57172	and shall be sanctified in them in the sight of the heathen,
c57173	then shall they dwell in their land
c57174	that I have given to my servant Jacob.
c57175	And they shall dwell safely therein,
c57176	and shall build houses,
c57177	and plant vineyards;
c57178	yea, they shall dwell with confidence,
c57179	when I have executed judgments upon all
c57180	those that despise them round about
c57181	them; and they shall know
c57182	that I <i>am</i> the LORD their God.
c57183	In the tenth year, in the tenth <i>month,</i> in the twelfth <i>day</i> of the month,
c57184	the word of the LORD came unto
c57185	me, saying,
c57186	Son of man,
c57187	set thy face against Pharaoh king of Egypt,
c57188	and prophesy against him, and against all Egypt:
c57189	Speak,
c57190	and say,
c57191	Thus saith the Lord GOD;
c57192	Behold, I <i>am</i> against
c57193	thee, Pharaoh king of Egypt, the great dragon
c57194	that lieth in the midst of his rivers,
c57195	which hath said,
c57196	My river
c57197	<i>is</i> mine own, and I have made <i>it</i> for myself.
c57198	But I will put hooks in thy jaws,
c57199	and I will cause the fish of thy rivers to stick unto thy scales,
c57200	and I will bring thee up out of the midst of thy rivers,
c57201	and all the fish of thy rivers shall stick unto thy scales.
c57202	And I will leave thee <i>thrown</i> into the wilderness, thee and all the fish of thy rivers:
c57203	thou shalt fall upon the open fields;
c57204	thou shalt not be brought together,
c57205	nor gathered:
c57206	I have given thee for meat to the beasts of the field and to the fowls of the heaven.
c57207	And all the inhabitants of Egypt shall know
c57208	that I <i>am</i> the LORD,
c57209	because they have been a staff of reed to the house of Israel.
c57210	When they took hold of thee by thy hand,
c57211	thou didst break,
c57212	and rend all their shoulder:
c57214	and when they leaned upon
c57215	thee, thou brakest,
c57216	and madest all their loins to be at a stand.
c57217	Therefore
c57218	thus saith the Lord GOD;
c57219	Behold, I will bring a sword upon
c57220	thee, and cut off man and beast out of thee.
c57221	And the land of Egypt shall be desolate and waste;
c57222	and they shall know
c57223	that I <i>am</i> the LORD:
c57224	because he hath said,
c57225	The river
c57226	<i>is</i> mine, and I have made <i>it.</i>
c57228	Behold, therefore I <i>am</i> against thee, and against thy rivers,
c57229	and I will make the land of Egypt utterly waste <i>and</i> desolate, from the tower of Syene even unto the border of Ethiopia.
c57230	No foot of man shall pass
c57231	through it, nor foot of beast shall pass
c57232	through it, neither shall it be inhabited forty years.
c57233	And I will make the land of Egypt desolate in the midst of the countries <i>that are</i> desolate,
c57234	and her cities among the cities <i>that are</i> laid waste shall be desolate forty years:
c57235	and I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations,
c57236	and will disperse them through the countries.
c57237	Yet thus saith the Lord GOD;
c57238	At the end of forty years will I gather the Egyptians from the people
c57239	whither they were scattered:
c57240	And I will bring again the captivity of Egypt,
c57241	and will cause them to return <i>into</i> the land of Pathros, into the land of their habitation;
c57242	and they shall be there a base kingdom.
c57243	It shall be the basest of the kingdoms;
c57244	neither shall it exalt itself any more above the nations:
c57245	for I will diminish
c57246	them, that they shall no more rule over the nations.
c57247	And it shall be no more the confidence of the house of Israel,
c57248	which bringeth <i>their</i> iniquity to remembrance,
c57249	when they shall look after
c57250	them: but they shall know
c57251	that I <i>am</i> the Lord GOD.
c57252	And it came to pass in the seven and twentieth year, in the first <i>month,</i> in the first <i>day</i> of the month,
c57253	the word of the LORD came unto
c57254	me, saying,
c57255	Son of man,
c57256	Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon caused his army to serve a great service against Tyrus:
c57257	every head <i>was</i> made bald,
c57258	and every shoulder <i>was</i> peeled:
c57259	yet had he no wages, nor his army, for Tyrus, for the service
c57260	that he had served against it:
c57261	Therefore
c57262	thus saith the Lord GOD;
c57263	Behold, I will give the land of Egypt unto Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon;
c57264	and he shall take her multitude,
c57265	and take her spoil,
c57266	and take her prey;
c57267	and it shall be the wages for his army.
c57268	<i>for</i> his labour
c57269	wherewith he served
c57270	I have given him the land of Egypt
c57271	against it, because they wrought
c57272	for me, saith the Lord GOD.
c57273	In that day will I cause the horn of the house of Israel to bud forth,
c57274	and I will give thee the opening of the mouth in the midst
c57275	of them; and they shall know
c57276	that I <i>am</i> the LORD.
c57277	The word of the LORD came again unto
c57278	me, saying,
c57279	Son of man,
c57280	prophesy
c57281	and say,
c57282	Thus saith the Lord GOD;
c57283	Howl
c57284	ye, Woe worth the day!
c57285	For the day <i>is</i> near,
c57286	even the day of the LORD <i>is</i> near,
c57287	a cloudy day; it shall be the time of the heathen.
c57288	And the sword shall come upon Egypt,
c57289	and great pain shall be in Ethiopia,
c57290	when the slain shall fall in Egypt,
c57291	and they shall take away her multitude,
c57292	and her foundations shall be broken down.
c57293	Ethiopia, and Libya, and Lydia, and all the mingled people, and Chub, and the men of the land that is in league, shall fall with them by the sword.
c57294	Thus saith the LORD;
c57295	They also that uphold Egypt shall fall;
c57296	and the pride of her power shall come down: from the tower of Syene
c57297	shall they fall in it by the sword,
c57298	saith the Lord GOD.
c57299	And they shall be desolate in the midst of the countries <i>that are</i> desolate,
c57300	and her cities shall be in the midst of the cities <i>that are</i> wasted.
c57301	And they shall know
c57302	that I <i>am</i> the LORD,
c57303	when I have set a fire in Egypt,
c57304	and <i>when</i> all her helpers shall be destroyed.
c57305	In that day shall messengers go forth from me in ships
c57306	to make the careless Ethiopians afraid,
c57307	and great pain shall come upon them, as in the day of Egypt:
c57308	for, lo, it cometh.
c57309	Thus saith the Lord GOD;
c57310	I will also make the multitude of Egypt to cease by the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon.
c57311	He and his people with him, the terrible of the nations, shall be brought
c57312	to destroy the land:
c57313	and they shall draw their swords against Egypt,
c57314	and fill the land with the slain.
c57315	And I will make the rivers dry,
c57316	and sell the land into the hand of the wicked:
c57317	and I will make the land waste, and all that is therein, by the hand of strangers:
c57318	I the LORD have spoken <i>it.</i>
c57319	Thus saith the Lord GOD;
c57320	I will also destroy the idols,
c57321	and I will cause <i>their</i> images to cease out of Noph;
c57322	and there shall be no more a prince of the land of Egypt:
c57323	and I will put a fear in the land of Egypt.
c57324	And I will make Pathros desolate,
c57325	and will set fire in Zoan,
c57326	and will execute judgments in No.
c57327	And I will pour my fury upon Sin, the strength of Egypt;
c57328	and I will cut off the multitude of No.
c57329	And I will set fire in Egypt:
c57330	Sin shall have great pain,
c57331	and No shall be
c57332	rent asunder,
c57333	and Noph <i>shall have</i> distresses daily.
c57334	The young men of Aven and of Pibeseth shall fall by the sword:
c57335	and these <i>cities</i> shall go into captivity.
c57336	At Tehaphnehes also the day shall be darkened,
c57337	when I shall break there the yokes of Egypt:
c57338	and the pomp of her strength shall cease
c57339	in her: as for her,
c57340	a cloud shall cover
c57341	her, and her daughters shall go into captivity.
c57342	Thus will I execute judgments in Egypt:
c57343	and they shall know
c57344	that I <i>am</i> the LORD.
c57345	And it came to pass in the eleventh year, in the first <i>month,</i> in the seventh <i>day</i> of the month,
c57346	<i>that</i> the word of the LORD came unto
c57347	me, saying,
c57348	Son of man,
c57349	I have broken the arm of Pharaoh king of Egypt;
c57350	and, lo,
c57351	it shall not be bound up
c57352	to be healed,
c57353	to put a roller
c57354	to bind
c57355	it, to make it strong
c57356	to hold the sword.
c57357	Therefore
c57358	thus saith the Lord GOD;
c57359	Behold, I <i>am</i> against Pharaoh king of Egypt,
c57360	and will break his arms, the strong, and that which was broken;
c57361	and I will cause the sword to fall out of his hand.
c57362	And I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations,
c57363	and will disperse them through the countries.
c57364	And I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon,
c57365	and put my sword in his hand:
c57366	but I will break Pharaoh's arms,
c57367	and he shall groan before him with the groanings of a deadly wounded <i>man.</i>
c57368	But I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon,
c57369	and the arms of Pharaoh shall fall down;
c57370	and they shall know
c57371	that I <i>am</i> the LORD,
c57372	when I shall put my sword into the hand of the king of Babylon,
c57373	and he shall stretch it out upon the land of Egypt.
c57374	And I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations,
c57375	and disperse them among the countries;
c57376	and they shall know
c57377	that I <i>am</i> the LORD.
c57378	And it came to pass in the eleventh year, in the third <i>month,</i> in the first <i>day</i> of the month,
c57379	<i>that</i> the word of the LORD came unto
c57380	me, saying,
c57381	Son of man,
c57382	speak unto Pharaoh king of Egypt, and to his multitude;
c57383	Whom art thou like in thy greatness?
c57384	Behold, the Assyrian <i>was</i> a cedar in Lebanon
c57385	with fair branches,
c57386	and with a shadowing shroud,
c57387	and of an high stature;
c57388	and his top was among the thick boughs.
c57389	The waters made him great,
c57390	the deep set him up on high
c57391	with her rivers running round about his plants,
c57392	and sent out her little rivers unto all the trees of the field.
c57393	Therefore his height was exalted above all the trees of the field,
c57394	and his boughs were multiplied,
c57395	and his branches became long because of the multitude of waters,
c57396	when he shot forth.
c57397	All the fowls of heaven made their nests in his boughs,
c57398	and under his branches did all the beasts of the field bring forth their young,
c57399	and under his shadow dwelt all great nations.
c57400	Thus was he fair in his greatness, in the length of his branches:
c57401	for his root was by great waters.
c57402	The cedars in the garden of God could not hide
c57403	him: the fir trees were not like his boughs,
c57404	and the chesnut trees were not like his branches;
c57405	nor any tree in the garden of God was like unto him in his beauty.
c57406	I have made him fair by the multitude of his branches:
c57407	so that all the trees of Eden, that <i>were</i> in the garden of God, envied him.
c57409	Therefore
c57410	thus saith the Lord GOD;
c57411	Because thou hast lifted up thyself in height,
c57412	and he hath shot up his top among the thick boughs,
c57413	and his heart is lifted up in his height;
c57414	I have therefore delivered him into the hand of the mighty one of the heathen;
c57415	he shall surely deal with him: I have driven him out for his wickedness.
c57417	And strangers, the terrible of the nations, have cut him off,
c57418	and have left
c57419	him: upon the mountains and in all the valleys his branches are fallen,
c57420	and his boughs are broken by all the rivers of the land;
c57421	and all the people of the earth are gone down from his shadow,
c57422	and have left him.
c57423	Upon his ruin shall all the fowls of the heaven remain,
c57424	and all the beasts of the field shall be upon his branches:
c57425	To the end that none of all the trees by the waters exalt themselves for their height,
c57426	neither shoot up their top among the thick boughs,
c57427	neither their trees stand up in their height, all that drink water:
c57428	for they are all delivered unto death, to the nether parts of the earth, in the midst of the children of men, with them that go down to the pit.
c57429	Thus saith the Lord GOD;
c57430	In the day
c57431	when he went down to the grave
c57432	I caused a mourning:
c57433	I covered the deep for
c57434	him, and I restrained the floods
c57435	thereof, and the great waters were stayed:
c57436	and I caused Lebanon to mourn for
c57437	him, and all the trees of the field fainted for him.
c57438	I made the nations to shake at the sound of his fall,
c57439	when I cast him down to hell with them that descend into the pit:
c57440	and all the trees of Eden, the choice and best of Lebanon, all that drink water, shall be comforted in the nether parts of the earth.
c57441	They also went down into hell with him unto <i>them that be</i> slain with the sword;
c57442	and <i>they that were</i> his arm, <i>that</i> dwelt under his shadow in the midst of the heathen.
c57443	To whom art thou thus like in glory and in greatness among the trees of Eden?
c57444	yet shalt thou be brought down with the trees of Eden unto the nether parts of the earth:
c57445	thou shalt lie in the midst of the uncircumcised
c57446	with <i>them that be</i> slain by the sword.
c57447	This <i>is</i> Pharaoh and all his multitude,
c57448	saith the Lord GOD.
c57449	And it came to pass in the twelfth year, in the twelfth month, in the first <i>day</i> of the month,
c57450	<i>that</i> the word of the LORD came unto
c57451	me, saying,
c57452	Son of man,
c57453	take up a lamentation for Pharaoh king of Egypt,
c57454	and say unto
c57455	a young lion of the nations,
c57456	him, Thou art like
c57457	and thou <i>art</i> as a whale in the seas:
c57458	and thou camest forth with thy rivers,
c57459	and troubledst the waters with thy feet,
c57460	and fouledst their rivers.
c57461	Thus saith the Lord GOD;
c57462	I will therefore spread out my net over thee with a company of many people;
c57463	and they shall bring thee up in my net.
c57464	Then will I leave thee upon the land,
c57465	I will cast thee forth upon the open field,
c57466	and will cause all the fowls of the heaven to remain upon
c57467	thee, and I will fill the beasts of the whole earth with thee.
c57468	And I will lay thy flesh upon the mountains,
c57469	and fill the valleys with thy height.
c57470	I will also water with thy blood the land wherein thou swimmest,
c57471	<i>even</i> to the mountains;
c57472	and the rivers shall be full of thee.
c57474	And when I shall put thee out, I will cover the heaven,
c57475	and make the stars thereof dark;
c57476	I will cover the sun with a cloud,
c57477	and the moon shall not give her light.
c57478	All the bright lights of heaven will I make dark over
c57479	thee, and set darkness upon thy land,
c57480	saith the Lord GOD.
c57481	I will also vex the hearts of many people,
c57482	when I shall bring thy destruction among the nations,
c57483	into the countries
c57484	which thou hast not known.
c57485	Yea, I will make many people amazed at
c57486	thee, and their kings shall be horribly afraid for
c57487	thee, when I shall brandish my sword before
c57488	them; and they shall tremble at <i>every</i> moment,
c57489	every man for his own life,
c57490	in the day of thy fall.
c57491	For thus saith the Lord GOD;
c57492	The sword of the king of Babylon shall come upon thee.
c57493	By the swords of the mighty will I cause thy multitude to fall,
c57494	the terrible of the nations, all
c57495	of them: and they shall spoil the pomp of Egypt,
c57496	and all the multitude thereof shall be destroyed.
c57497	I will destroy also all the beasts thereof from beside the great waters;
c57498	neither shall the foot of man trouble them any more,
c57499	nor the hoofs of beasts trouble them.
c57500	Then will I make their waters deep,
c57501	and cause their rivers to run like oil,
c57502	saith the Lord GOD.
c57503	When I shall make the land of Egypt desolate,
c57504	and the country shall be destitute of that whereof it was full,
c57505	when I shall smite all
c57506	them that dwell
c57507	therein, then shall they know
c57508	that I <i>am</i> the LORD.
c57509	This <i>is</i> the lamentation wherewith they shall lament
c57511	her: the daughters of the nations shall lament
c57512	her: they shall lament for her, <i>even</i> for Egypt, and for all her multitude,
c57513	saith the Lord GOD.
c57514	It came to pass also in the twelfth year, in the fifteenth <i>day</i> of the month,
c57515	<i>that</i> the word of the LORD came unto
c57516	me, saying,
c57517	Son of man,
c57518	wail for the multitude of Egypt,
c57519	and cast them down, <i>even</i> her, and the daughters of the famous nations, unto the nether parts of the earth, with them that go down into the pit.
c57520	Whom dost thou pass in beauty?
c57521	go down,
c57522	and be thou laid with the uncircumcised.
c57523	They shall fall in the midst of <i>them that are</i> slain by the sword:
c57524	she is delivered to the sword:
c57525	draw
c57526	her and all her multitudes.
c57527	The strong among the mighty shall speak to him out of the midst of hell with them that help
c57528	him: they are gone down,
c57529	they lie uncircumcised, slain by the sword.
c57530	Asshur <i>is</i> there and all her company:
c57531	his graves <i>are</i> about
c57532	him: all of them slain,
c57533	fallen by the sword:
c57534	Whose graves are set in the sides of the pit,
c57535	and her company is round about her grave:
c57536	all of them slain,
c57537	fallen by the sword,
c57538	which caused terror in the land of the living.
c57539	There <i>is</i> Elam and all her multitude round about her grave,
c57540	all of them slain,
c57541	fallen by the sword,
c57542	which are gone down uncircumcised into the nether parts of the earth,
c57543	which caused their terror in the land of the living;
c57544	yet have they borne their shame with them that go down to the pit.
c57545	They have set her a bed in the midst of the slain with all her multitude:
c57546	her graves <i>are</i> round about
c57547	him: all of them uncircumcised,
c57548	slain by the sword:
c57549	though their terror was caused in the land of the living,
c57550	yet have they borne their shame with them that go down to the pit:
c57551	he is put in the midst of <i>them that be</i> slain.
c57552	There <i>is</i> Meshech, Tubal, and all her multitude:
c57553	her graves <i>are</i> round about
c57554	him: all of them uncircumcised, slain by the sword,
c57555	though they caused their terror in the land of the living.
c57556	And they shall not lie with the mighty
c57557	<i>that are</i> fallen of the uncircumcised,
c57558	which are gone down to hell with their weapons of war:
c57559	and they have laid their swords under their heads,
c57560	but their iniquities shall be upon their bones,
c57561	though <i>they were</i> the terror of the mighty in the land of the living.
c57562	Yea, thou shalt be broken in the midst of the uncircumcised,
c57563	and shalt lie with <i>them that are</i> slain with the sword.
c57564	There <i>is</i> Edom, her kings, and all her princes,
c57565	which with their might are laid by <i>them that were</i> slain by the sword:
c57566	they shall lie with the uncircumcised,
c57567	and with them that go down to the pit.
c57568	There <i>be</i> the princes of the north, all of them, and all the Zidonians,
c57569	which are gone down with the slain; with their terror
c57570	they are ashamed of their might;
c57571	and they lie uncircumcised with <i>them that be</i> slain by the sword,
c57572	and bear their shame with them that go down to the pit.
c57573	Pharaoh shall see
c57574	them, and shall be comforted over all his multitude,
c57575	<i>even</i> Pharaoh and all his army slain by the sword,
c57576	saith the Lord GOD.
c57577	For I have caused my terror in the land of the living:
c57578	and he shall be laid in the midst of the uncircumcised with <i>them that are</i> slain with the sword, <i>even</i> Pharaoh and all his multitude,
c57579	saith the Lord GOD.
c57580	Again the word of the LORD came unto
c57581	me, saying,
c57582	Son of man,
c57583	speak to the children of thy people,
c57584	and say unto
c57585	a land,
c57586	them, When I bring the sword upon
c57587	if the people of the land take a man of their coasts,
c57588	and set him for their watchman:
c57589	If when he seeth the sword
c57590	come upon the land,
c57591	he blow the trumpet,
c57592	and warn the people;
c57593	Then whosoever heareth the sound of the trumpet,
c57594	and taketh not warning;
c57595	if the sword come,
c57596	and take him away,
c57597	his blood shall be upon his own head.
c57598	He heard the sound of the trumpet,
c57599	and took not warning;
c57600	his blood shall be
c57601	upon him. But he that taketh warning
c57602	shall deliver his soul.
c57604	But if the watchman see the sword
c57605	come,
c57606	and blow not the trumpet,
c57607	and the people be not warned;
c57608	if the sword come,
c57609	and take <i>any</i> person
c57611	from among them, he is taken away in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at the watchman's hand.
c57612	So thou,
c57613	O son of man,
c57614	I have set thee a watchman unto the house of Israel;
c57615	therefore thou shalt hear the word at my mouth,
c57616	and warn them from me.
c57617	When I say unto the wicked,
c57618	O wicked
c57619	<i>man,</i> thou shalt surely die;
c57620	if thou dost not speak
c57621	to warn the wicked from his way,
c57622	that wicked <i>man</i> shall die in his iniquity;
c57623	but his blood will I require at thine hand.
c57625	Nevertheless, if thou warn the wicked of his way
c57626	to turn from
c57627	it; if he do not turn from his way,
c57628	he shall die in his iniquity;
c57629	but thou hast delivered thy soul.
c57630	Therefore, O thou
c57631	son of man,
c57632	speak unto the house of Israel;
c57633	Thus ye speak,
c57634	saying,
c57635	If our transgressions and our sins <i>be</i> upon
c57636	us, and we pine away
c57637	in them, how should we then live?
c57638	Say unto
c57639	them, <i>As</i> I live,
c57640	saith the Lord GOD,
c57641	I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked;
c57642	but that the wicked turn from his way
c57643	and live:
c57644	turn
c57645	ye, turn ye from your evil ways;
c57646	for why will ye die,
c57647	O house of Israel?
c57648	Therefore, thou
c57649	son of man,
c57650	say unto the children of thy people,
c57651	The righteousness of the righteous shall not deliver him in the day of his transgression:
c57652	as for the wickedness of the wicked,
c57653	he shall not fall thereby in the day
c57654	that he turneth from his wickedness;
c57655	neither shall the righteous be able
c57656	to live for his <i>righteousness</i> in the day
c57657	that he sinneth.
c57658	When I shall say to the righteous,
c57659	<i>that</i> he shall surely live;
c57660	if he trust to his own righteousness,
c57661	and commit iniquity,
c57662	all his righteousnesses shall not be remembered;
c57663	but for his iniquity
c57664	that he hath committed,
c57665	he shall die for it.
c57667	Again, when I say unto the wicked,
c57668	Thou shalt surely die;
c57669	if he turn from his sin,
c57670	and do that which is lawful and right;
c57671	<i>If</i> the wicked restore the pledge,
c57672	give again that he had robbed,
c57673	walk in the statutes of life,
c57674	without committing iniquity;
c57675	he shall surely live,
c57676	he shall not die.
c57678	that he hath committed shall be mentioned
c57679	None of his sins
c57680	unto him: he hath done that which is lawful and right;
c57681	he shall surely live.
c57682	Yet the children of thy people say,
c57683	The way of the Lord is not equal:
c57684	but as for them,
c57685	their way is not equal.
c57686	When the righteous turneth from his righteousness,
c57687	and committeth iniquity,
c57688	he shall even die thereby.
c57690	But if the wicked turn from his wickedness,
c57691	and do that which is lawful and right,
c57692	he shall live thereby.
c57693	Yet ye say,
c57694	The way of the Lord is not equal.
c57695	you every one after his ways.
c57696	I will judge
c57697	O ye house of Israel,
c57698	And it came to pass in the twelfth year of our captivity, in the tenth <i>month,</i> in the fifth <i>day</i> of the month,
c57699	<i>that</i> one that had escaped out of Jerusalem came unto
c57700	me, saying,
c57701	The city is smitten.
c57702	Now the hand of the LORD was upon me in the evening,
c57703	afore he that was escaped came;
c57704	and had opened my mouth,
c57705	until he came to me in the morning;
c57706	and my mouth was opened,
c57707	and I was no more dumb.
c57708	Then the word of the LORD came unto
c57709	me, saying,
c57710	Son of man,
c57711	they that inhabit those wastes of the land of Israel speak,
c57712	saying,
c57713	Abraham was one,
c57714	and he inherited the land:
c57715	but we <i>are</i> many;
c57716	the land is given us for inheritance.
c57717	Wherefore
c57718	say unto
c57719	them, Thus saith the Lord GOD;
c57720	Ye eat with the blood,
c57721	and lift up your eyes toward your idols,
c57722	and shed blood:
c57723	and shall ye possess the land?
c57724	Ye stand upon your sword,
c57725	ye work abomination,
c57727	every one his neighbour's wife:
c57728	and ye defile
c57729	and shall ye possess the land?
c57730	Say thou thus unto
c57731	them, Thus saith the Lord GOD;
c57732	<i>As</i> I live,
c57733	surely
c57734	they that <i>are</i> in the wastes
c57735	shall fall by the sword,
c57737	and him that <i>is</i> in the open field
c57738	will I give to the beasts
c57739	to be devoured,
c57741	and they that <i>be</i> in the forts and in the caves
c57742	shall die of the pestilence.
c57743	For I will lay the land most desolate,
c57744	and the pomp of her strength shall cease;
c57745	and the mountains of Israel shall be desolate, that none shall pass through.
c57746	Then shall they know
c57747	that I <i>am</i> the LORD,
c57748	when I have laid the land most desolate because of all their abominations
c57749	which they have committed.
c57750	Also, thou
c57751	son of man,
c57752	the children of thy people
c57753	still are talking against thee by the walls and in the doors of the houses,
c57754	and speak one to another, every one to
c57755	his brother,
c57756	saying,
c57757	Come, I pray you,
c57758	and hear
c57759	what is the word
c57760	that cometh forth from the LORD.
c57761	And they come unto thee as the people cometh,
c57762	and they sit before thee <i>as</i> my people,
c57763	and they hear thy words,
c57764	but they will not do
c57765	them: for with their mouth they shew much love,
c57766	<i>but</i> their heart goeth after their covetousness.
c57767	And, lo, thou <i>art</i> unto them as a very lovely song of one that hath a pleasant voice,
c57769	and can play well on an instrument:
c57770	for they hear thy words,
c57771	but they do them not.
c57772	And when this cometh to pass,
c57773	(lo, it will come,)
c57774	then shall they know
c57775	that a prophet hath been among them.
c57776	And the word of the LORD came unto
c57777	me, saying,
c57778	Son of man,
c57779	prophesy against the shepherds of Israel,
c57780	prophesy,
c57781	and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD unto the shepherds;
c57783	Woe <i>be</i> to the shepherds of Israel
c57784	that do feed
c57785	themselves! should not the shepherds feed the flocks?
c57786	Ye eat the fat,
c57787	and ye clothe you with the wool,
c57788	ye kill them that are fed:
c57789	<i>but</i> ye feed not the flock.
c57790	The diseased have ye not strengthened,
c57791	neither have ye healed that which was sick,
c57792	neither have ye bound up <i>that which was</i> broken,
c57793	neither have ye brought again that which was driven away,
c57794	neither have ye sought that which was lost;
c57795	but with force and with cruelty have ye ruled them.
c57796	And they were scattered, because <i>there is</i> no shepherd:
c57797	and they became meat to all the beasts of the field,
c57798	when they were scattered.
c57799	My sheep wandered through all the mountains, and upon every high hill:
c57800	yea, my flock was scattered upon all the face of the earth,
c57801	and none did search
c57802	or seek <i>after them.</i>
c57803	Therefore,
c57804	ye shepherds,
c57805	hear the word of the LORD;
c57806	<i>As</i> I live,
c57807	saith the Lord GOD,
c57808	surely
c57809	because my flock became a prey,
c57810	and my flock became meat to every beast of the field, because <i>there was</i> no shepherd,
c57811	neither did my shepherds search for my flock,
c57812	but the shepherds fed
c57813	themselves, and fed not my flock;
c57814	Therefore,
c57815	O ye shepherds,
c57816	hear the word of the LORD;
c57817	Thus saith the Lord GOD;
c57818	Behold, I <i>am</i> against the shepherds;
c57819	and I will require my flock at their hand,
c57820	and cause them to cease
c57821	from feeding the flock;
c57822	neither shall the shepherds feed themselves any more;
c57823	for I will deliver my flock from their mouth,
c57824	that they may not be meat for them.
c57825	For thus saith the Lord GOD;
c57826	Behold,
c57827	I, <i>even</i> I,
c57828	will both search my sheep,
c57829	and seek them out.
c57831	As a shepherd seeketh out his flock
c57832	in the day
c57833	that he is among his sheep <i>that are</i> scattered;
c57834	so will I seek out my sheep,
c57835	and will deliver them out of all places
c57836	where they have been scattered in the cloudy and dark day.
c57837	And I will bring them out from the people,
c57838	and gather them from the countries,
c57839	and will bring them to their own land,
c57840	and feed them upon the mountains of Israel by the rivers, and in all the inhabited places of the country.
c57841	I will feed them in a good pasture,
c57842	and upon the high mountains of Israel shall their fold be:
c57843	there shall they lie in a good fold,
c57844	and <i>in</i> a fat pasture shall they feed upon the mountains of Israel.
c57845	I will feed my flock,
c57846	and I will cause them to lie down,
c57847	saith the Lord GOD.
c57848	I will seek that which was lost,
c57849	and bring again that which was driven away,
c57850	and will bind up <i>that which was</i> broken,
c57851	and will strengthen that which was sick:
c57852	but I will destroy the fat and the strong;
c57853	I will feed them with judgment.
c57854	And <i>as for</i> you,
c57855	O my flock,
c57856	thus saith the Lord GOD;
c57857	Behold, I judge between cattle and cattle, between the rams and the he goats.
c57858	<i>Seemeth it</i> a small thing unto
c57859	you to have eaten up the good pasture,
c57860	but ye must tread down with your feet the residue of your pastures?
c57861	and to have drunk of the deep waters,
c57862	but ye must foul the residue with your feet?
c57863	And <i>as for</i> my flock, they eat that which ye have trodden with your feet;
c57864	and they drink that which ye have fouled with your feet.
c57865	Therefore
c57866	thus saith the Lord GOD unto
c57867	them; Behold,
c57868	I,
c57869	<i>even</i> I, will judge between the fat cattle and between the lean cattle.
c57870	Because ye have thrust with side and with shoulder,
c57871	and pushed all the diseased with your horns,
c57872	till ye have scattered them abroad;
c57873	Therefore will I save my flock,
c57874	and they shall no more be a prey;
c57875	and I will judge between cattle and cattle.
c57876	And I will set up one shepherd over
c57877	them, and he shall feed them, <i>even</i> my servant David;
c57878	he shall feed them, and he
c57879	shall be their shepherd.
c57880	And I the LORD will be their God,
c57881	and my servant David a prince among
c57882	them; I the LORD have spoken <i>it.</i>
c57883	And I will make with them a covenant of peace,
c57884	and will cause the evil beasts to cease out of the land:
c57885	and they shall dwell safely in the wilderness,
c57886	and sleep in the woods.
c57887	And I will make them and the places round about my hill a blessing;
c57888	and I will cause the shower to come down in his season;
c57889	there shall be showers of blessing.
c57890	And the tree of the field shall yield her fruit,
c57891	and the earth shall yield her increase,
c57892	and they shall be safe in their land,
c57893	and shall know
c57894	that I <i>am</i> the LORD,
c57895	when I have broken the bands of their yoke,
c57896	and delivered them out of the hand
c57897	of those that served themselves of them.
c57898	And they shall no more be a prey to the heathen,
c57899	neither shall the beast of the land devour
c57900	them; but they shall dwell safely,
c57901	and none shall make <i>them</i> afraid.
c57902	And I will raise up for them a plant of renown,
c57903	and they shall be no more consumed with hunger in the land,
c57904	neither bear the shame of the heathen any more.
c57905	Thus shall they know
c57906	that I the LORD their God <i>am</i> with
c57907	them, and <i>that</i> they, <i>even</i> the house of Israel, <i>are</i> my people,
c57908	saith the Lord GOD.
c57909	And ye my flock, the flock of my pasture,
c57910	<i>are</i> men,
c57911	<i>and</i> I <i>am</i> your God,
c57912	saith the Lord GOD.
c57913	Moreover the word of the LORD came unto
c57914	me, saying,
c57915	Son of man,
c57916	set thy face against mount Seir,
c57917	and prophesy against it,
c57918	And say
c57919	unto it, Thus saith the Lord GOD;
c57920	Behold, O mount Seir, I <i>am</i> against
c57922	thee, and I will stretch out mine hand against
c57923	thee, and I will make thee most desolate.
c57924	I will lay thy cities waste,
c57925	and thou shalt be desolate,
c57926	and thou shalt know
c57927	that I <i>am</i> the LORD.
c57928	Because thou hast had a perpetual hatred,
c57929	and hast shed <i>the blood of</i> the children of Israel by the force of the sword in the time of their calamity, in the time <i>that their</i> iniquity <i>had</i> an end:
c57930	Therefore,
c57931	<i>as</i> I live,
c57932	saith the Lord GOD,
c57933	I will prepare thee unto blood,
c57934	and blood shall pursue
c57935	thee: sith thou hast not hated blood,
c57936	even blood shall pursue thee.
c57937	Thus will I make mount Seir most desolate,
c57938	and cut off from it him that passeth out and him that returneth.
c57939	And I will fill his mountains with his slain
c57940	<i>men:</i> in thy hills, and in thy valleys, and in all thy rivers,
c57941	shall they fall that are slain with the sword.
c57942	I will make thee perpetual desolations,
c57943	and thy cities shall not return:
c57944	and ye shall know
c57945	that I <i>am</i> the LORD.
c57946	Because thou hast said,
c57947	These two nations and these two countries
c57948	shall be
c57949	mine, and we will possess
c57950	it; whereas the LORD was there:
c57951	Therefore,
c57952	<i>as</i> I live,
c57953	saith the Lord GOD,
c57954	I will even do according to thine anger, and according to thine envy
c57955	which thou hast used out of thy hatred
c57956	against them; and I will make myself known
c57957	among them, when I have judged thee.
c57958	And thou shalt know
c57959	that I <i>am</i> the LORD,
c57960	<i>and that</i> I have heard all thy blasphemies
c57961	which thou hast spoken against the mountains of Israel,
c57962	saying,
c57963	They are laid desolate,
c57964	they are given us to consume.
c57965	Thus with your mouth ye have boasted against
c57966	me, and have multiplied your words against
c57967	me: I have heard <i>them.</i>
c57968	Thus saith the Lord GOD;
c57969	When the whole earth rejoiceth,
c57970	I will make thee desolate.
c57971	As thou didst rejoice at the inheritance of the house of Israel,
c57972	because it was desolate,
c57973	so will I do
c57974	unto thee: thou shalt be desolate,
c57975	O mount Seir, and all Idumea, <i>even</i> all
c57976	of it: and they shall know
c57977	that I <i>am</i> the LORD.
c57978	Also, thou
c57979	son of man,
c57980	prophesy unto the mountains of Israel,
c57981	and say,
c57982	Ye mountains of Israel,
c57983	hear the word of the LORD:
c57984	Thus saith the Lord GOD;
c57985	Because the enemy hath said against
c57986	you, Aha,
c57987	even the ancient high places are ours in possession:
c57988	Therefore
c57989	prophesy
c57990	and say,
c57991	Thus saith the Lord GOD;
c57992	Because
c57993	they have made <i>you</i> desolate,
c57994	and swallowed you up on every side,
c57995	that ye might be a possession unto the residue of the heathen,
c57996	and ye are taken up in the lips of talkers, and <i>are</i> an infamy of the people:
c57997	Therefore,
c57998	ye mountains of Israel,
c57999	hear the word of the Lord GOD;
c58000	Thus saith the Lord GOD to the mountains, and to the hills, to the rivers, and to the valleys, to the desolate wastes,
c58002	and to the cities
c58003	that are forsaken,
c58004	which became a prey and derision to the residue of the heathen
c58005	that <i>are</i> round about;
c58006	Therefore
c58007	thus saith the Lord GOD;
c58008	Surely in the fire of my jealousy have I spoken against the residue of the heathen, and against all Idumea,
c58009	which have appointed my land into their possession with the joy of all <i>their</i> heart, with despiteful minds,
c58010	to cast it out for a prey.
c58012	Prophesy therefore concerning the land of Israel,
c58013	and say unto the mountains, and to the hills, to the rivers, and to the valleys,
c58014	Thus saith the Lord GOD;
c58015	Behold, I have spoken in my jealousy and in my fury,
c58016	because ye have borne the shame of the heathen:
c58017	Therefore
c58018	thus saith the Lord GOD;
c58019	I have lifted up mine hand,
c58020	Surely the heathen
c58021	that <i>are</i> about
c58022	you, they shall bear their shame.
c58023	But ye,
c58024	O mountains of Israel,
c58025	ye shall shoot forth your branches,
c58026	and yield your fruit to my people of Israel;
c58027	for they are at hand
c58028	to come.
c58029	For, behold, I <i>am</i> for
c58030	you, and I will turn unto
c58031	you, and ye shall be tilled
c58032	and sown:
c58033	And I will multiply men upon you, all the house of Israel, <i>even</i> all
c58034	of it: and the cities shall be inhabited,
c58035	and the wastes shall be builded:
c58036	And I will multiply upon you man and beast;
c58037	and they shall increase
c58038	and bring fruit:
c58039	and I will settle you after your old estates,
c58040	and will do better <i>unto you</i> than at your beginnings:
c58041	and ye shall know
c58042	that I <i>am</i> the LORD.
c58043	Yea, I will cause men to walk upon you, <i>even</i> my people Israel;
c58044	and they shall possess
c58045	thee, and thou shalt be their inheritance,
c58046	and thou shalt no more henceforth
c58047	bereave them <i>of men.</i>
c58048	Thus saith the Lord GOD;
c58049	Because they say
c58050	unto you, Thou <i>land</i> devourest up men,
c58051	and hast bereaved thy nations;
c58052	Therefore
c58053	thou shalt devour men no more,
c58054	neither bereave thy nations any more,
c58055	saith the Lord GOD.
c58056	Neither will I cause <i>men</i> to hear in thee the shame of the heathen any more,
c58057	neither shalt thou bear the reproach of the people any more,
c58058	neither shalt thou cause thy nations to fall any more,
c58059	saith the Lord GOD.
c58060	Moreover the word of the LORD came unto
c58061	me, saying,
c58062	Son of man,
c58063	when the house of Israel
c58064	dwelt in their own land,
c58065	they defiled it by their own way and by their doings:
c58066	their way was before me as the uncleanness of a removed woman.
c58067	Wherefore I poured my fury upon them for the blood
c58068	that they had shed upon the land,
c58069	and for their idols <i>wherewith</i> they had polluted it:
c58070	And I scattered them among the heathen,
c58071	and they were dispersed through the countries:
c58072	according to their way and according to their doings I judged them.
c58073	And when they entered unto the heathen,
c58074	whither they went,
c58075	they profaned my holy name,
c58076	when they said
c58077	to them, These <i>are</i> the people of the LORD,
c58078	and are gone forth out of his land.
c58079	But I had pity for mine holy name,
c58080	which the house of Israel had profaned among the heathen,
c58081	whither they went.
c58082	Therefore
c58083	say unto the house of Israel,
c58084	Thus saith the Lord GOD;
c58085	I do not <i>this</i> for your sakes,
c58086	O house of Israel,
c58087	but for mine holy name's
c58088	sake, which ye have profaned among the heathen,
c58089	whither ye went.
c58090	And I will sanctify my great name,
c58091	which was profaned among the heathen,
c58092	which ye have profaned in the midst
c58093	of them; and the heathen shall know
c58094	that I <i>am</i> the LORD,
c58095	saith the Lord GOD,
c58096	when I shall be sanctified in you before their eyes.
c58097	For I will take you from among the heathen,
c58098	and gather you out of all countries,
c58099	and will bring you into your own land.
c58100	Then will I sprinkle clean water upon
c58101	you, and ye shall be clean: from all your filthiness,
c58102	and from all your idols, will I cleanse you.
c58103	A new heart also will I give
c58104	you, and a new spirit will I put within
c58105	you: and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh,
c58106	and I will give you an heart of flesh.
c58107	And I will put my spirit within you, and cause
c58109	you to walk in my statutes,
c58110	and ye shall keep my judgments,
c58111	and do <i>them.</i>
c58112	And ye shall dwell in the land
c58113	that I gave to your fathers;
c58114	and ye shall be my people,
c58115	and I will be your God.
c58116	I will also save you from all your uncleannesses:
c58117	and I will call for the corn,
c58118	and will increase
c58119	it, and lay no famine upon you.
c58120	And I will multiply the fruit of the tree, and the increase of the field,
c58121	that ye shall receive no more reproach of famine among the heathen.
c58122	Then shall ye remember your own evil ways,
c58123	and your doings
c58124	that <i>were</i> not good,
c58125	and shall lothe yourselves in your own sight for your iniquities and for your abominations.
c58126	Not for your sakes do I
c58127	<i>this,</i> saith the Lord GOD,
c58128	be it known
c58129	unto you: be ashamed
c58130	and confounded for your own ways,
c58131	O house of Israel.
c58132	Thus saith the Lord GOD;
c58133	In the day
c58134	that I shall have cleansed you from all your iniquities
c58135	I will also cause <i>you</i> to dwell in the cities,
c58136	and the wastes shall be builded.
c58137	And the desolate land shall be tilled,
c58138	whereas it lay desolate in the sight of all that passed by.
c58139	And they shall say,
c58140	This land
c58141	that was desolate
c58142	is become like the garden of Eden;
c58143	and the waste and desolate and ruined cities <i>are become</i> fenced, <i>and</i> are inhabited.
c58144	Then the heathen that are left round about you shall know
c58146	that I the LORD build
c58147	the ruined
c58148	<i>places, and</i> plant
c58149	that that was desolate:
c58150	I the LORD have spoken
c58151	<i>it,</i> and I will do <i>it.</i>
c58152	Thus saith the Lord GOD;
c58153	I will yet <i>for</i> this be enquired of by the house of Israel,
c58154	to do
c58155	<i>it</i> for them; I will increase them with men like a flock.
c58156	As the holy flock,
c58157	as the flock of Jerusalem in her solemn feasts;
c58158	so shall the waste cities be filled with flocks of men:
c58159	and they shall know
c58160	that I <i>am</i> the LORD.
c58161	The hand of the LORD was upon
c58162	me, and carried me out in the spirit of the LORD,
c58163	and set me down in the midst of the valley
c58164	which <i>was</i> full of bones,
c58165	And caused me to pass by them round about:
c58166	and, behold,
c58167	<i>there were</i> very many in the open valley;
c58168	and, lo,
c58169	<i>they were</i> very dry.
c58170	And he said unto
c58171	me, Son of man,
c58172	can these bones live?
c58173	And I answered,
c58174	O Lord GOD,
c58175	thou knowest.
c58176	Again he said unto
c58177	me, Prophesy upon these bones,
c58178	and say unto
c58179	them, O ye dry bones,
c58180	hear the word of the LORD.
c58181	Thus saith the Lord GOD unto these bones;
c58182	Behold, I will cause breath to enter
c58183	into you, and ye shall live:
c58184	And I will lay sinews upon
c58185	you, and will bring up flesh upon
c58186	you, and cover you with skin,
c58187	and put breath
c58188	in you, and ye shall live;
c58189	and ye shall know
c58190	that I <i>am</i> the LORD.
c58191	So I prophesied
c58192	as I was commanded:
c58193	there was a noise,
c58194	and as I prophesied,
c58195	and behold
c58196	a shaking,
c58197	and the bones came together,
c58198	bone to his bone.
c58199	And when I beheld,
c58200	lo,
c58201	the sinews and the flesh came up upon
c58203	them, and the skin covered them above:
c58204	but <i>there was</i> no breath in them.
c58205	Then said he unto
c58206	me, Prophesy unto the wind,
c58207	prophesy,
c58208	son of man,
c58209	and say to the wind,
c58210	Thus saith the Lord GOD;
c58211	Come from the four winds,
c58212	O breath,
c58213	and breathe upon these slain,
c58214	that they may live.
c58215	So I prophesied
c58216	as he commanded
c58217	me, and the breath came
c58218	into them, and they lived,
c58219	and stood up upon their feet,
c58220	an exceeding great army.
c58221	Then he said unto
c58222	me, Son of man,
c58223	these bones
c58224	are the whole house of Israel:
c58225	behold, they say,
c58226	Our bones are dried,
c58227	and our hope is lost:
c58228	we are cut off for our parts.
c58229	Therefore
c58230	prophesy
c58231	and say unto
c58232	them, Thus saith the Lord GOD;
c58233	Behold, O my people, I will open your graves,
c58234	and cause you to come up out of your graves,
c58236	and bring you into the land of Israel.
c58237	And ye shall know
c58238	that I <i>am</i> the LORD,
c58239	when I have opened your graves,
c58240	and brought you up out of your graves,
c58241	O my people,
c58242	And shall put my spirit
c58243	in you, and ye shall live,
c58244	and I shall place you in your own land:
c58245	then shall ye know
c58246	that I the LORD have spoken
c58247	<i>it,</i> and performed
c58248	<i>it,</i> saith the LORD.
c58249	The word of the LORD came again unto
c58250	me, saying,
c58251	Moreover, thou
c58252	son of man,
c58253	take thee one stick,
c58254	and write upon
c58255	it, For Judah, and for the children of Israel his companions:
c58256	then take another stick,
c58257	and write upon
c58258	it, For Joseph, the stick of Ephraim, and <i>for</i> all the house of Israel his companions:
c58259	And join them one to another into one stick;
c58260	and they shall become one in thine hand.
c58262	And when the children of thy people shall speak unto
c58263	thee, saying,
c58264	Wilt thou not shew
c58265	us what thou <i>meanest</i> by these?
c58266	Say unto
c58267	them, Thus saith the Lord GOD;
c58268	Behold, I will take the stick of Joseph,
c58269	which <i>is</i> in the hand of Ephraim,
c58270	and the tribes of Israel his fellows,
c58271	and will put them with him, <i>even</i> with the stick of Judah,
c58272	and make them one stick,
c58273	and they shall be one in mine hand.
c58274	And the sticks whereon thou writest shall be
c58276	in thine hand before their eyes.
c58277	And say unto
c58278	them, Thus saith the Lord GOD;
c58279	Behold, I will take the children of Israel from among the heathen,
c58280	whither they be gone,
c58281	and will gather them on every side,
c58282	and bring them into their own land:
c58283	And I will make them one nation in the land upon the mountains of Israel;
c58284	and one king shall be king to them all:
c58285	and they shall be no more two nations,
c58286	neither shall they be divided into two kingdoms any more at all:
c58287	Neither shall they defile themselves any more with their idols, nor with their detestable things, nor with any of their transgressions:
c58288	but I will save them out of all their dwellingplaces,
c58289	wherein they have sinned,
c58290	and will cleanse
c58291	them: so shall they be my people,
c58292	and I will be their God.
c58293	And David my servant <i>shall be</i> king over
c58294	them; and they all shall have one shepherd:
c58295	they shall also walk in my judgments,
c58296	and observe my statutes,
c58297	and do them.
c58298	And they shall dwell in the land
c58299	that I have given unto Jacob my servant,
c58300	wherein your fathers have dwelt;
c58301	and they shall dwell therein, <i>even</i> they, and their children, and their children's children for ever:
c58302	and my servant David <i>shall be</i> their prince for ever.
c58303	Moreover I will make a covenant of peace
c58304	with them; it shall be an everlasting covenant with
c58305	them: and I will place
c58306	them, and multiply
c58307	them, and will set my sanctuary in the midst of them for evermore.
c58308	My tabernacle also shall be with
c58309	them: yea, I will be their God,
c58310	and they shall be my people.
c58311	And the heathen shall know
c58312	that I the LORD do sanctify Israel,
c58313	when my sanctuary shall be in the midst of them for evermore.
c58314	And the word of the LORD came unto me,
c58315	saying,
c58316	Son of man,
c58317	set thy face against Gog, the land of Magog, the chief prince of Meshech and Tubal,
c58318	and prophesy against him,
c58319	And say,
c58320	Thus saith the Lord GOD;
c58321	Behold, I <i>am</i> against
c58322	thee, O Gog, the chief prince of Meshech and Tubal:
c58323	And I will turn thee back,
c58324	and put hooks into thy jaws,
c58325	and I will bring thee forth, and all thine army, horses and horsemen,
c58326	all of them clothed with all sorts
c58327	<i>of armour, even</i> a great company <i>with</i> bucklers and shields,
c58328	all of them handling swords:
c58329	Persia, Ethiopia, and Libya with
c58330	them; all of them with shield and helmet:
c58331	Gomer, and all his bands; the house of Togarmah of the north quarters, and all his bands:
c58332	<i>and</i> many people with thee.
c58333	Be thou prepared,
c58334	and prepare for thyself, thou, and all thy company
c58335	that are assembled unto
c58336	thee, and be thou a guard unto them.
c58337	After many days thou shalt be visited:
c58338	in the latter years thou shalt come into the land
c58339	<i>that is</i> brought back from the sword,
c58340	<i>and is</i> gathered out of many people, against the mountains of Israel,
c58341	which have been always waste:
c58342	but it is brought forth out of the nations,
c58343	and they shall dwell safely all of them.
c58344	Thou shalt ascend
c58345	and come like a storm,
c58346	like a cloud
c58347	to cover the land,
c58348	thou shalt be
c58349	thou, and all thy bands,
c58350	and many people with thee.
c58351	Thus saith the Lord GOD;
c58352	It shall also come to pass,
c58353	<i>that</i> at the same time shall things come into thy mind,
c58354	and thou shalt think an evil thought:
c58355	And thou shalt say,
c58356	I will go up to the land of unwalled villages;
c58357	I will go to them that are at rest, that dwell safely,
c58358	all of them dwelling without walls,
c58359	and having neither bars nor gates,
c58360	To take a spoil,
c58361	and to take a prey;
c58362	to turn thine hand upon the desolate places <i>that are now</i> inhabited, and upon the people
c58363	<i>that are</i> gathered out of the nations,
c58364	which have gotten cattle and goods,
c58365	that dwell in the midst of the land.
c58366	Sheba, and Dedan, and the merchants of Tarshish, with all the young lions thereof, shall say
c58368	to take a spoil?
c58369	unto thee, Art thou come
c58371	to take a prey?
c58372	hast thou gathered thy company
c58373	to carry away silver and gold,
c58374	to take away cattle and goods,
c58375	to take a great spoil?
c58376	Therefore,
c58377	prophesy
c58378	son of man,
c58379	and say unto Gog,
c58380	Thus saith the Lord GOD;
c58381	In that day when my people of Israel dwelleth safely, shalt thou not
c58383	know <i>it?</i>
c58384	And thou shalt come from thy place out of the north parts, thou, and many people with
c58385	thee, all of them riding upon horses,
c58386	a great company, and a mighty army:
c58387	And thou shalt come up against my people of Israel, as a cloud
c58388	to cover the land;
c58389	it shall be in the latter days,
c58390	and I will bring thee against my land,
c58391	that the heathen may know
c58392	me, when I shall be sanctified in thee, O Gog, before their eyes.
c58394	Thus saith the Lord GOD;
c58395	<i>Art</i> thou he
c58396	of whom I have spoken in old time by my servants the prophets of Israel,
c58397	which prophesied in those days <i>many</i> years
c58398	that I would bring thee against them?
c58399	And it shall come to pass at the same time when
c58400	Gog shall come against the land of Israel,
c58401	saith the Lord GOD,
c58402	<i>that</i> my fury shall come up in my face.
c58403	For in my jealousy <i>and</i> in the fire of my wrath have I spoken,
c58404	Surely in that day there shall be a great shaking in the land of Israel;
c58405	So that the fishes of the sea, and the fowls of the heaven, and the beasts of the field, and all creeping things that creep upon the earth, and all the men
c58408	that <i>are</i> upon the face of the earth, shall shake at my presence,
c58409	and the mountains shall be thrown down,
c58410	and the steep places shall fall,
c58411	and every wall shall fall to the ground.
c58412	And I will call for a sword against him throughout all my mountains,
c58413	saith the Lord GOD:
c58414	every man's sword shall be against his brother.
c58415	And I will plead against him with pestilence and with blood; and I will rain upon him, and upon his bands, and upon the many people
c58416	him, an overflowing rain, and great hailstones, fire, and brimstone.
c58417	that <i>are</i> with
c58418	Thus will I magnify myself,
c58419	and sanctify myself;
c58420	and I will be known in the eyes of many nations,
c58421	and they shall know
c58422	that I <i>am</i> the LORD.
c58423	Therefore, thou
c58424	son of man,
c58425	prophesy against Gog,
c58426	and say,
c58427	Thus saith the Lord GOD;
c58428	Behold, I <i>am</i> against
c58429	thee, O Gog, the chief prince of Meshech and Tubal:
c58430	And I will turn thee back,
c58431	and leave but the sixth part
c58432	of thee, and will cause thee to come up from the north parts,
c58433	and will bring thee upon the mountains of Israel:
c58434	And I will smite thy bow out of thy left hand,
c58435	and will cause thine arrows to fall out of thy right hand.
c58436	Thou shalt fall upon the mountains of Israel, thou, and all thy bands, and the people
c58437	that <i>is</i> with
c58438	thee: I will give thee unto the ravenous birds of every sort, and <i>to</i> the beasts of the field to be devoured.
c58439	Thou shalt fall upon the open field:
c58440	for I have spoken
c58441	<i>it,</i> saith the Lord GOD.
c58442	And I will send a fire on Magog, and among them that dwell carelessly in the isles:
c58443	and they shall know
c58444	that I <i>am</i> the LORD.
c58445	So will I make my holy name known in the midst of my people Israel;
c58446	and I will not <i>let them</i> pollute my holy name any more:
c58447	and the heathen shall know
c58448	that I <i>am</i> the LORD,
c58449	the Holy One in Israel.
c58450	Behold, it is come,
c58451	and it is done,
c58452	saith the Lord GOD;
c58453	this <i>is</i> the day
c58454	whereof I have spoken.
c58455	And they that dwell in the cities of Israel shall go forth,
c58456	and shall set on fire
c58457	and burn the weapons, both the shields and the bucklers, the bows and the arrows, and the handstaves, and the spears,
c58458	and they shall burn them with fire seven years:
c58459	So that they shall take no wood out of the field,
c58460	neither cut down <i>any</i> out of the forests;
c58461	for they shall burn the weapons with fire:
c58462	and they shall spoil those that spoiled
c58463	them, and rob those that robbed
c58464	them, saith the Lord GOD.
c58465	And it shall come to pass in that day,
c58466	<i>that</i> I will give unto Gog a place
c58467	there of graves in Israel,
c58468	the valley of the passengers on the east of the sea:
c58469	and it shall stop the <i>noses</i> of the passengers:
c58470	and there shall they bury Gog and all his multitude:
c58471	and they shall call <i>it</i> The valley of Hamongog.
c58473	And seven months shall the house of Israel be burying of them, that they may cleanse the land.
c58474	Yea, all the people of the land shall bury
c58475	<i>them;</i> and it shall be to them a renown the day
c58476	that I shall be glorified,
c58477	saith the Lord GOD.
c58478	And they shall sever out men of continual employment,
c58479	passing through the land
c58480	to bury with the passengers those that remain upon the face of the earth,
c58481	to cleanse
c58482	it: after the end of seven months shall they search.
c58483	And the passengers <i>that</i> pass through the land,
c58484	when <i>any</i> seeth a man's bone,
c58485	then shall he set up a sign by
c58486	it, till the buriers have buried it in the valley of Hamongog.
c58487	And also the name of the city <i>shall be</i> Hamonah.
c58488	Thus shall they cleanse the land.
c58489	And, thou
c58490	son of man,
c58491	thus saith the Lord GOD;
c58492	Speak unto every feathered fowl, and to every beast of the field,
c58493	Assemble yourselves,
c58494	and come;
c58495	gather yourselves on every side to my sacrifice
c58496	that I do sacrifice
c58497	for you, <i>even</i> a great sacrifice upon the mountains of Israel,
c58498	that ye may eat flesh,
c58499	and drink blood.
c58500	Ye shall eat the flesh of the mighty,
c58501	and drink the blood of the princes of the earth, of rams, of lambs, and of goats, of bullocks,
c58502	all of them fatlings of Bashan.
c58503	And ye shall eat fat till ye be full,
c58504	and drink blood till ye be drunken, of my sacrifice
c58505	which I have sacrificed for you.
c58506	Thus ye shall be filled at my table with horses and chariots, with mighty men, and with all men of war,
c58507	saith the Lord GOD.
c58508	And I will set my glory among the heathen,
c58509	and all the heathen shall see my judgment
c58510	that I have executed,
c58511	and my hand
c58512	that I have laid upon them.
c58513	So the house of Israel shall know
c58514	that I <i>am</i> the LORD their God from that day and forward.
c58515	And the heathen shall know
c58516	that the house of Israel went into captivity for their iniquity:
c58517	because they trespassed
c58518	against me, therefore hid I my face from
c58519	them, and gave them into the hand of their enemies:
c58520	so fell they all by the sword.
c58521	According to their uncleanness and according to their transgressions have I done
c58522	unto them, and hid my face from them.
c58523	Therefore
c58524	thus saith the Lord GOD;
c58525	Now will I bring again the captivity of Jacob,
c58526	and have mercy upon the whole house of Israel,
c58527	and will be jealous for my holy name;
c58528	After that they have borne their shame, and all their trespasses whereby they have trespassed
c58530	against me, when they dwelt safely in their land,
c58531	and none made <i>them</i> afraid.
c58532	When I have brought them again from the people,
c58533	and gathered them out of their enemies' lands,
c58534	and am sanctified in them in the sight of many nations;
c58535	Then shall they know
c58536	that I <i>am</i> the LORD their God,
c58537	which caused them to be led into captivity among the heathen:
c58538	but I have gathered them unto their own land,
c58539	and have left none of them any more there.
c58540	Neither will I hide my face any more from
c58541	them: for I have poured out my spirit upon the house of Israel,
c58542	saith the Lord GOD.
c58543	In the five and twentieth year of our captivity, in the beginning of the year, in the tenth <i>day</i> of the month, in the fourteenth year
c58544	after that the city was smitten,
c58545	in the selfsame day the hand of the LORD was upon
c58546	me, and brought me thither.
c58547	In the visions of God brought he me into the land of Israel,
c58548	and set me upon a very high mountain,
c58549	by which <i>was</i> as the frame of a city on the south.
c58550	And he brought me thither,
c58551	and, behold, <i>there was</i> a man,
c58552	whose appearance <i>was</i> like the appearance of brass,
c58553	with a line of flax in his hand,
c58554	and a measuring reed;
c58555	and he stood in the gate.
c58556	And the man said unto
c58557	me, Son of man,
c58558	behold with thine eyes,
c58559	and hear with thine ears,
c58560	and set thine heart upon all
c58561	that I shall shew
c58562	thee; for
c58563	to the intent that I might shew
c58564	<i>them</i> unto thee <i>art</i> thou brought hither:
c58565	declare all
c58566	that thou seest
c58567	to the house of Israel.
c58568	And behold
c58569	a wall on the outside of the house round about,
c58570	and in the man's hand a measuring reed of six cubits
c58571	<i>long</i> by the cubit and an hand breadth:
c58572	so he measured the breadth of the building,
c58573	one reed;
c58574	and the height,
c58575	one reed.
c58576	Then came he unto the gate
c58577	which looketh toward the east,
c58578	and went up the stairs
c58579	thereof, and measured the threshold of the gate,
c58580	<i>which was</i> one reed broad;
c58581	and the other threshold
c58582	<i>of the gate, which was</i> one reed broad.
c58583	And <i>every</i> little chamber
c58584	<i>was</i> one reed long,
c58585	and one reed broad;
c58586	and between the little chambers <i>were</i> five cubits;
c58587	and the threshold of the gate by the porch of the gate within <i>was</i> one reed.
c58588	He measured also the porch of the gate within,
c58589	one reed.
c58590	Then measured he the porch of the gate,
c58591	eight cubits;
c58592	and the posts
c58593	thereof, two cubits;
c58594	and the porch of the gate <i>was</i> inward.
c58595	And the little chambers of the gate eastward
c58596	<i>were</i> three on this side,
c58597	and three on that side;
c58598	they three <i>were</i> of one measure:
c58599	and the posts had one measure on this side and on that side.
c58600	And he measured the breadth of the entry of the gate,
c58601	ten cubits;
c58602	<i>and</i> the length of the gate,
c58603	thirteen cubits.
c58604	The space also before the little chambers <i>was</i> one cubit
c58605	<i>on this side,</i> and the space <i>was</i> one cubit on that side:
c58606	and the little chambers <i>were</i> six cubits on this side,
c58607	and six cubits on that side.
c58608	He measured then the gate from the roof of <i>one</i> little chamber to the roof
c58609	of another: the breadth <i>was</i> five and twenty cubits,
c58610	door against door.
c58611	He made also posts
c58612	of threescore cubits,
c58613	even unto the post of the court round about the gate.
c58614	And from the face of the gate of the entrance unto the face of the porch of the inner gate <i>were</i> fifty cubits.
c58615	And <i>there were</i> narrow windows to the little chambers, and to their posts
c58616	within the gate round about,
c58617	and likewise to the arches:
c58618	and windows <i>were</i> round about inward:
c58619	and upon <i>each</i> post <i>were</i> palm trees.
c58620	Then brought he me into the outward court,
c58621	and, lo, <i>there were</i> chambers,
c58622	and a pavement made for the court round about:
c58623	thirty chambers <i>were</i> upon the pavement.
c58624	And the pavement by the side of the gates over against the length of the gates
c58625	<i>was</i> the lower pavement.
c58626	Then he measured the breadth from the forefront of the lower gate unto the forefront of the inner court without,
c58627	an hundred cubits eastward and northward.
c58628	And the gate
c58629	that looked toward the north,
c58630	of the outward court
c58631	he measured the length thereof, and the breadth thereof.
c58632	And the little chambers thereof <i>were</i> three on this side
c58633	and three on that side;
c58634	and the posts thereof and the arches thereof were after the measure of the first gate:
c58635	the length thereof <i>was</i> fifty cubits,
c58636	and the breadth five and twenty cubits.
c58637	And their windows, and their arches, and their palm trees, <i>were</i> after the measure of the gate
c58638	that looketh toward the east;
c58639	and they went up unto it by seven steps;
c58640	and the arches thereof <i>were</i> before them.
c58641	And the gate of the inner court <i>was</i> over against the gate toward the north, and toward the east;
c58642	and he measured from gate to gate
c58643	an hundred cubits.
c58644	After that he brought me toward the south,
c58645	and behold a gate toward the south:
c58646	and he measured the posts thereof and the arches thereof according to these measures.
c58647	And <i>there were</i> windows in it and in the arches thereof round about, like those windows:
c58648	the length <i>was</i> fifty cubits,
c58649	and the breadth five and twenty cubits.
c58650	And <i>there were</i> seven steps to go up
c58651	to it, and the arches thereof <i>were</i> before
c58652	them: and it had palm trees,
c58653	one on this side,
c58654	and another on that side,
c58655	upon the posts thereof.
c58656	And <i>there was</i> a gate in the inner court toward the south:
c58657	and he measured from gate to gate toward the south
c58658	an hundred cubits.
c58659	And he brought me to the inner court by the south gate:
c58660	and he measured the south gate according to these measures;
c58661	And the little chambers thereof, and the posts thereof, and the arches thereof, according to these measures:
c58662	and <i>there were</i> windows in it and in the arches thereof round about:
c58663	<i>it was</i> fifty cubits long,
c58664	and five and twenty cubits broad.
c58665	And the arches round about
c58666	<i>were</i> five and twenty cubits long,
c58667	and five cubits broad.
c58668	And the arches thereof <i>were</i> toward the utter court;
c58669	and palm trees <i>were</i> upon the posts
c58670	thereof: and the going up to it <i>had</i> eight steps.
c58671	And he brought me into the inner court toward the east:
c58672	and he measured the gate according to these measures.
c58673	And the little chambers thereof, and the posts thereof, and the arches thereof, <i>were</i> according to these measures:
c58674	and <i>there were</i> windows therein and in the arches thereof round about:
c58675	<i>it was</i> fifty cubits long,
c58676	and five and twenty cubits broad.
c58677	And the arches thereof <i>were</i> toward the outward court;
c58678	and palm trees <i>were</i> upon the posts thereof, on this side, and on that side:
c58679	and the going up to it <i>had</i> eight steps.
c58680	And he brought me to the north gate,
c58681	and measured <i>it</i> according to these measures;
c58682	The little chambers thereof, the posts thereof, and the arches
c58683	thereof, and the windows to it round about:
c58684	the length <i>was</i> fifty cubits,
c58685	and the breadth five and twenty cubits.
c58686	And the posts thereof <i>were</i> toward the utter court;
c58687	and palm trees <i>were</i> upon the posts thereof, on this side, and on that side:
c58688	and the going up to it <i>had</i> eight steps.
c58689	And the chambers
c58690	and the entries thereof <i>were</i> by the posts of the gates,
c58691	where they washed the burnt offering.
c58692	And in the porch of the gate <i>were</i> two tables on this side,
c58693	and two tables on that side,
c58694	to slay thereon the burnt offering and the sin offering and the trespass offering.
c58695	And at the side without, as one goeth up to the entry of the north gate, <i>were</i> two tables;
c58696	and on the other side,
c58697	which <i>was</i> at the porch of the gate,
c58698	<i>were</i> two tables.
c58699	Four tables <i>were</i> on this side,
c58700	and four tables on that side, by the side of the gate;
c58701	eight tables,
c58702	whereupon they slew <i>their sacrifices.</i>
c58703	And the four tables <i>were</i> of hewn stone for the burnt offering,
c58704	of a cubit and an half long,
c58705	and a cubit and an half broad,
c58706	and one cubit high:
c58707	whereupon
c58708	also they laid the instruments
c58709	wherewith they slew the burnt offering
c58710	and the sacrifice.
c58711	And within <i>were</i> hooks, an hand broad, fastened round about:
c58712	and upon the tables <i>was</i> the flesh of the offering.
c58713	And without the inner gate <i>were</i> the chambers of the singers in the inner court,
c58714	which <i>was</i> at the side of the north gate;
c58715	and their prospect <i>was</i> toward the south:
c58716	one at the side of the east gate <i>having</i> the prospect toward the north.
c58717	And he said unto
c58718	me, This chamber,
c58719	whose prospect <i>is</i> toward the south,
c58720	<i>is</i> for the priests, the keepers of the charge of the house.
c58721	And the chamber
c58722	whose prospect <i>is</i> toward the north
c58723	<i>is</i> for the priests, the keepers of the charge of the altar:
c58724	these <i>are</i> the sons of Zadok
c58725	among the sons of Levi, which come near to the LORD
c58726	to minister unto him.
c58727	So he measured the court,
c58728	an hundred cubits long,
c58729	and an hundred cubits broad,
c58730	foursquare;
c58731	and the altar <i>that was</i> before the house.
c58732	And he brought me to the porch of the house,
c58733	and measured <i>each</i> post of the porch,
c58734	five cubits on this side,
c58735	and five cubits on that side:
c58736	and the breadth of the gate <i>was</i> three cubits on this side,
c58737	and three cubits on that side.
c58738	The length of the porch <i>was</i> twenty cubits,
c58739	and the breadth eleven cubits;
c58740	and <i>he brought me</i> by the steps
c58741	whereby they went up to
c58742	it: and <i>there were</i> pillars by the posts,
c58743	one on this side,
c58744	and another on that side.
c58745	Afterward he brought me to the temple,
c58746	and measured the posts,
c58747	six cubits broad on the one side,
c58748	and six cubits broad on the other side,
c58749	<i>which was</i> the breadth of the tabernacle.
c58750	And the breadth of the door <i>was</i> ten cubits;
c58751	and the sides of the door <i>were</i> five cubits on the one side,
c58752	and five cubits on the other side:
c58753	and he measured the length
c58754	thereof, forty cubits:
c58755	and the breadth,
c58756	twenty cubits.
c58757	Then went he inward,
c58758	and measured the post of the door,
c58759	two cubits;
c58760	and the door,
c58761	six cubits;
c58762	and the breadth of the door,
c58763	seven cubits.
c58764	So he measured the length
c58765	thereof, twenty cubits;
c58766	and the breadth,
c58767	twenty cubits, before the temple:
c58768	and he said unto
c58769	me, This <i>is</i> the most holy <i>place.</i>
c58770	After he measured the wall of the house,
c58771	six cubits;
c58772	and the breadth of <i>every</i> side chamber,
c58773	four cubits, round about the house on every side.
c58774	And the side chambers <i>were</i> three, one over another,
c58775	and thirty in order;
c58776	and they entered into the wall
c58777	which <i>was</i> of the house
c58778	for the side chambers round about,
c58779	that they might have hold,
c58780	but they had not hold in the wall of the house.
c58781	And <i>there was</i> an enlarging,
c58782	and a winding about still upward to the side chambers:
c58783	for the winding about of the house went still upward round about the house:
c58784	therefore the breadth of the house <i>was still</i> upward,
c58785	and so increased <i>from</i> the lowest <i>chamber</i> to the highest by the midst.
c58786	I saw also the height of the house round about: the foundations of the side chambers
c58787	<i>were</i> a full reed of six great cubits.
c58788	The thickness of the wall,
c58789	which <i>was</i> for the side chamber without,
c58790	<i>was</i> five cubits:
c58791	and <i>that</i> which <i>was</i> left <i>was</i> the place of the side chambers
c58792	that <i>were</i> within.
c58793	And between the chambers <i>was</i> the wideness of twenty cubits round about the house on every side.
c58794	And the doors of the side chambers <i>were</i> toward <i>the place that was</i> left,
c58795	one door toward the north,
c58796	and another door toward the south:
c58797	and the breadth of the place that was left <i>was</i> five cubits round about.
c58798	Now the building
c58799	that <i>was</i> before the separate place at the end toward the west
c58800	<i>was</i> seventy cubits broad;
c58801	and the wall of the building <i>was</i> five cubits thick round about,
c58802	and the length thereof ninety cubits.
c58803	So he measured the house,
c58804	an hundred cubits long;
c58805	and the separate place, and the building, with the walls
c58806	thereof, an hundred cubits long;
c58807	Also the breadth of the face of the house, and of the separate place toward the east, an hundred cubits.
c58808	And he measured the length of the building over against the separate place
c58809	which <i>was</i> behind
c58810	it, and the galleries thereof on the one side and on the other side,
c58811	an hundred cubits,
c58812	with the inner temple, and the porches of the court;
c58813	The door posts, and the narrow windows, and the galleries round about on their three stories,
c58814	over against the door, cieled with wood round about,
c58815	and from the ground up to the windows,
c58816	and the windows <i>were</i> covered;
c58817	To that above the door, even unto the inner house, and without, and by all the wall round about
c58818	within and without, by measure.
c58819	And <i>it was</i> made with cherubims and palm trees,
c58820	so that a palm tree <i>was</i> between a cherub and a cherub;
c58821	and <i>every</i> cherub had two faces;
c58822	So that the face of a man <i>was</i> toward the palm tree on the one side,
c58823	and the face of a young lion toward the palm tree on the other side:
c58824	<i>it was</i> made through all the house round about.
c58825	From the ground unto above the door <i>were</i> cherubims and palm trees made,
c58826	and <i>on</i> the wall of the temple.
c58827	The posts of the temple <i>were</i> squared,
c58828	<i>and</i> the face of the sanctuary; the appearance <i>of the one</i> as the appearance <i>of the other.</i>
c58829	The altar of wood
c58830	<i>was</i> three cubits high,
c58831	and the length thereof two cubits;
c58832	and the corners
c58833	thereof, and the length thereof, and the walls thereof, <i>were</i> of wood:
c58834	and he said unto
c58835	me, This <i>is</i> the table
c58836	that <i>is</i> before the LORD.
c58837	And the temple and the sanctuary had two doors.
c58838	And the doors had two leaves
c58839	<i>apiece,</i> two turning
c58840	leaves; two <i>leaves</i> for the one door,
c58841	and two leaves for the other <i>door.</i>
c58842	And <i>there were</i> made on them, on the doors of the temple, cherubims and palm trees,
c58843	like as <i>were</i> made upon the walls;
c58844	and <i>there were</i> thick planks upon the face of the porch without.
c58845	And <i>there were</i> narrow windows and palm trees on the one side and on the other side, on the sides of the porch, and <i>upon</i> the side chambers of the house, and thick planks.
c58846	Then he brought me forth into the utter court,
c58847	the way toward the north:
c58848	and he brought me into the chamber
c58849	that <i>was</i> over against the separate place,
c58850	and which <i>was</i> before the building toward the north.
c58851	Before the length of an hundred cubits <i>was</i> the north door,
c58852	and the breadth <i>was</i> fifty cubits.
c58853	Over against the twenty
c58854	<i>cubits</i> which <i>were</i> for the inner court,
c58855	and over against the pavement
c58856	which <i>was</i> for the utter court,
c58857	<i>was</i> gallery against gallery in three <i>stories.</i>
c58858	And before the chambers <i>was</i> a walk of ten cubits breadth
c58859	inward, a way of one cubit;
c58860	and their doors toward the north.
c58861	Now the upper chambers <i>were</i> shorter:
c58862	for the galleries were higher than these, than the lower, and than the middlemost of the building.
c58863	For they <i>were</i> in three
c58864	<i>stories,</i> but had not pillars as the pillars of the courts:
c58865	therefore <i>the building</i> was straitened more than the lowest and the middlemost from the ground.
c58866	And the wall
c58867	that <i>was</i> without over against the chambers, toward the utter court on the forepart of the chambers,
c58868	the length thereof <i>was</i> fifty cubits.
c58869	For the length of the chambers
c58870	that <i>were</i> in the utter court
c58871	<i>was</i> fifty cubits:
c58872	and, lo, before the temple <i>were</i> an hundred cubits.
c58873	And from under these chambers <i>was</i> the entry on the east side,
c58874	as one goeth into them from the utter court.
c58875	The chambers <i>were</i> in the thickness of the wall of the court toward the east, over against the separate place, and over against the building.
c58876	And the way before them <i>was</i> like the appearance of the chambers
c58877	which <i>were</i> toward the north,
c58878	as long
c58879	as they, <i>and</i> as broad
c58880	as they: and all their goings out
c58881	<i>were</i> both according to their fashions, and according to their doors.
c58882	And according to the doors of the chambers
c58883	that <i>were</i> toward the south
c58884	<i>was</i> a door in the head of the way,
c58885	<i>even</i> the way directly before the wall toward the east,
c58886	as one entereth into them.
c58887	Then said he unto
c58888	me, The north chambers <i>and</i> the south chambers,
c58889	which <i>are</i> before the separate place,
c58890	they <i>be</i> holy chambers,
c58891	where the priests that approach unto the LORD shall eat
c58893	the most holy things:
c58894	there shall they lay the most holy things, and the meat offering, and the sin offering, and the trespass offering;
c58895	for the place <i>is</i> holy.
c58896	When the priests enter
c58897	therein, then shall they not go out of the holy <i>place</i> into the utter court,
c58898	but there they shall lay their garments
c58899	wherein they minister;
c58900	for they <i>are</i> holy;
c58901	and shall put on other garments,
c58902	and shall approach
c58903	to <i>those things</i> which <i>are</i> for the people.
c58904	Now when he had made an end of measuring the inner house,
c58905	he brought me forth toward the gate
c58906	whose prospect <i>is</i> toward the east,
c58907	and measured it round about.
c58908	He measured the east side with the measuring reed,
c58909	five hundred reeds, with the measuring reed round about.
c58910	He measured the north side,
c58911	five hundred reeds, with the measuring reed round about.
c58912	He measured the south side,
c58913	five hundred reeds, with the measuring reed.
c58914	He turned about to the west side,
c58915	<i>and</i> measured five hundred reeds with the measuring reed.
c58916	He measured it by the four sides:
c58917	it had a wall round about,
c58918	five hundred <i>reeds</i> long,
c58919	and five hundred broad,
c58920	to make a separation between the sanctuary and the profane place.
c58921	Afterward he brought me to the gate,
c58922	<i>even</i> the gate
c58923	that looketh toward the east:
c58924	And, behold,
c58925	the glory of the God of Israel came from the way of the east:
c58926	and his voice <i>was</i> like a noise of many waters:
c58927	and the earth shined with his glory.
c58928	And <i>it was</i> according to the appearance of the vision
c58929	which I saw,
c58930	<i>even</i> according to the vision
c58931	that I saw
c58932	when I came
c58933	to destroy the city:
c58934	and the visions <i>were</i> like the vision
c58935	that I saw by the river Chebar;
c58936	and I fell upon my face.
c58937	And the glory of the LORD came into the house by the way of the gate
c58938	whose prospect <i>is</i> toward the east.
c58939	So the spirit took me up,
c58940	and brought me into the inner court;
c58941	and, behold,
c58942	the glory of the LORD filled the house.
c58943	And I heard
c58944	<i>him</i> speaking unto me out of the house;
c58945	and the man stood by me.
c58946	And he said unto
c58947	me, Son of man,
c58948	the place of my throne, and the place of the soles of my feet,
c58949	where I will dwell in the midst of the children of Israel for ever,
c58950	and my holy name, shall the house of Israel no more defile, <i>neither</i> they, nor their kings, by their whoredom, nor by the carcases of their kings in their high places.
c58951	In their setting of their threshold by my thresholds,
c58952	and their post by my posts,
c58953	and the wall between
c58954	me and them, they have even defiled my holy name by their abominations
c58955	that they have committed:
c58956	wherefore I have consumed them in mine anger.
c58957	Now let them put away their whoredom, and the carcases of their kings, far from
c58958	me, and I will dwell in the midst of them for ever.
c58959	Thou
c58960	son of man,
c58961	shew the house to the house of Israel,
c58962	that they may be ashamed of their iniquities:
c58963	and let them measure the pattern.
c58964	And if they be ashamed of all
c58965	that they have done,
c58966	shew them the form of the house, and the fashion thereof, and the goings out thereof, and the comings in thereof, and all the forms thereof, and all the ordinances thereof, and all the forms thereof, and all the laws
c58967	thereof: and write <i>it</i> in their sight,
c58968	that they may keep the whole form thereof, and all the ordinances
c58969	thereof, and do them.
c58970	This <i>is</i> the law of the house;
c58971	Upon the top of the mountain the whole limit thereof round about <i>shall be</i> most holy.
c58972	Behold, this <i>is</i> the law of the house.
c58973	And these <i>are</i> the measures of the altar after the cubits:
c58974	The cubit <i>is</i> a cubit and an hand breadth;
c58975	even the bottom <i>shall be</i> a cubit,
c58976	and the breadth a cubit,
c58977	and the border thereof by the edge thereof round about <i>shall be</i> a span:
c58978	and this <i>shall be</i> the higher place of the altar.
c58979	And from the bottom <i>upon</i> the ground <i>even</i> to the lower settle <i>shall be</i> two cubits,
c58980	and the breadth one cubit;
c58981	and from the lesser settle <i>even</i> to the greater settle <i>shall be</i> four cubits,
c58982	and the breadth <i>one</i> cubit.
c58984	So the altar <i>shall be</i> four cubits; and from the altar and upward <i>shall be</i> four horns.
c58985	And the altar
c58986	<i>shall be</i> twelve <i>cubits</i> long, twelve broad,
c58987	square in the four squares thereof.
c58988	And the settle
c58989	<i>shall be</i> fourteen <i>cubits</i> long and fourteen broad in the four squares
c58990	thereof; and the border about it <i>shall be</i> half a cubit;
c58991	and the bottom thereof <i>shall be</i> a cubit about;
c58992	and his stairs shall look toward the east.
c58993	And he said unto
c58994	me, Son of man,
c58995	thus saith the Lord GOD;
c58996	These <i>are</i> the ordinances of the altar
c58997	in the day
c58998	when they shall make
c58999	it, to offer burnt offerings thereon,
c59000	and to sprinkle blood thereon.
c59001	And thou shalt give to the priests the Levites
c59002	that be of the seed of Zadok,
c59003	which approach unto
c59004	unto me, saith the Lord GOD,
c59005	me, to minister
c59006	a young bullock for a sin offering.
c59007	And thou shalt take of the blood
c59008	thereof, and put <i>it</i> on the four horns of it, and on the four corners of the settle, and upon the border round about:
c59009	thus shalt thou cleanse
c59010	and purge it.
c59011	Thou shalt take the bullock also of the sin offering,
c59012	and he shall burn it in the appointed place of the house, without the sanctuary.
c59013	And on the second day thou shalt offer a kid of the goats without blemish for a sin offering;
c59014	and they shall cleanse the altar,
c59015	as they did cleanse <i>it</i> with the bullock.
c59016	When thou hast made an end
c59017	of cleansing
c59018	<i>it,</i> thou shalt offer a young bullock without blemish, and a ram out of the flock without blemish.
c59019	And thou shalt offer them before the LORD,
c59020	and the priests shall cast salt upon
c59021	them, and they shall offer them up <i>for</i> a burnt offering unto the LORD.
c59022	Seven days shalt thou prepare every day a goat <i>for</i> a sin offering:
c59023	they shall also prepare a young bullock, and a ram out of the flock, without blemish.
c59024	Seven days shall they purge the altar
c59025	and purify
c59026	it; and they shall consecrate themselves.
c59027	And when these days are expired,
c59028	it shall be, <i>that</i> upon the eighth day, and <i>so</i> forward,
c59029	the priests shall make your burnt offerings upon the altar, and your peace offerings;
c59030	and I will accept
c59031	you, saith the Lord GOD.
c59032	Then he brought me back the way of the gate of the outward sanctuary
c59033	which looketh toward the east;
c59034	and it <i>was</i> shut.
c59035	Then said the LORD unto
c59036	me; This gate shall be shut,
c59037	it shall not be opened,
c59038	and no man shall enter in
c59039	by it; because the LORD, the God of Israel, hath entered in
c59040	by it, therefore it shall be shut.
c59041	<i>It is</i> for the prince;
c59042	the prince, he shall sit
c59043	in it to eat bread before the LORD;
c59044	he shall enter by the way of the porch of <i>that</i> gate,
c59045	and shall go out by the way of the same.
c59046	Then brought he me the way of the north gate before the house:
c59047	and I looked,
c59048	and, behold,
c59049	the glory of the LORD filled the house of the LORD:
c59050	and I fell upon my face.
c59051	And the LORD said unto
c59052	me, Son of man,
c59053	mark well,
c59054	and behold with thine eyes,
c59055	and hear with thine ears all
c59056	that I say unto thee concerning all the ordinances of the house of the LORD, and all the laws
c59057	thereof; and mark well the entering in of the house, with every going forth of the sanctuary.
c59058	And thou shalt say to the rebellious, <i>even</i> to the house of Israel,
c59059	Thus saith the Lord GOD;
c59060	let it suffice you of all your abominations,
c59061	O ye house of Israel,
c59062	In that ye have brought <i>into my sanctuary</i> strangers, uncircumcised in heart, and uncircumcised in flesh,
c59063	to be in my sanctuary,
c59064	to pollute it, <i>even</i> my house,
c59065	when ye offer my bread, the fat and the blood,
c59066	and they have broken my covenant because of all your abominations.
c59067	And ye have not kept the charge of mine holy things:
c59068	but ye have set keepers of my charge in my sanctuary for yourselves.
c59069	Thus saith the Lord GOD;
c59070	No stranger, uncircumcised in heart, nor uncircumcised in flesh, shall enter into my sanctuary,
c59071	of any stranger
c59072	that <i>is</i> among the children of Israel.
c59073	And the Levites
c59074	that are gone away far from
c59075	me, when Israel went astray,
c59076	which went astray away from me after their idols;
c59077	they shall even bear their iniquity.
c59078	Yet they shall be ministers in my sanctuary, <i>having</i> charge at the gates of the house,
c59079	and ministering to the house:
c59080	they shall slay the burnt offering and the sacrifice for the people,
c59081	and they shall stand before
c59082	them to minister unto them.
c59083	Because they ministered unto them before their idols,
c59084	and caused the house of Israel to fall into iniquity;
c59085	therefore have I lifted up mine hand against
c59086	them, saith the Lord GOD,
c59087	and they shall bear their iniquity.
c59088	And they shall not come near unto
c59089	me, to do the office of a priest
c59090	unto me, nor to come near to any of my holy things, in the most holy
c59091	<i>place:</i> but they shall bear their shame, and their abominations
c59092	which they have committed.
c59093	But I will make them keepers of the charge of the house, for all the service thereof, and for all
c59094	that shall be done therein.
c59095	But the priests the Levites, the sons of Zadok,
c59096	that kept the charge of my sanctuary
c59097	when the children of Israel went astray from
c59098	me, they shall come near to
c59099	me to minister
c59100	unto me, and they shall stand before
c59101	me to offer unto me the fat and the blood,
c59102	saith the Lord GOD:
c59103	They shall enter into my sanctuary,
c59104	and they shall come near to my table,
c59105	to minister
c59106	unto me, and they shall keep my charge.
c59107	And it shall come to pass,
c59108	<i>that</i> when they enter in at the gates of the inner court,
c59109	they shall be clothed with linen garments;
c59110	and no wool shall come upon
c59111	them, whiles they minister in the gates of the inner court, and within.
c59112	They shall have linen bonnets upon their heads,
c59113	and shall have linen breeches upon their loins;
c59114	they shall not gird <i>themselves</i> with any thing that causeth sweat.
c59115	And when they go forth into the utter court, <i>even</i> into the utter court to the people,
c59116	they shall put off their garments
c59117	wherein they ministered,
c59118	and lay them in the holy chambers,
c59119	and they shall put on other garments;
c59120	and they shall not sanctify the people with their garments.
c59121	Neither shall they shave their heads,
c59122	nor suffer their locks to grow long;
c59123	they shall only poll their heads.
c59124	Neither shall any priest drink wine,
c59125	when they enter into the inner court.
c59126	Neither shall they take for their wives a widow, nor her that is put away:
c59127	but they shall take maidens of the seed of the house of Israel,
c59128	or a widow that had a priest before.
c59130	And they shall teach my people <i>the difference</i> between the holy and profane,
c59131	and cause them to discern between the unclean and the clean.
c59132	And in controversy they shall stand in judgment;
c59133	<i>and</i> they shall judge it according to my judgments:
c59134	and they shall keep my laws and my statutes in all mine assemblies;
c59135	and they shall hallow my sabbaths.
c59136	And they shall come at no dead person
c59137	to defile
c59138	themselves: but for father, or for mother, or for son, or for daughter, for brother, or for sister
c59139	that hath had no husband,
c59140	they may defile themselves.
c59141	And after he is cleansed, they shall reckon unto him seven days.
c59142	And in the day
c59143	that he goeth into the sanctuary, unto the inner court,
c59144	to minister in the sanctuary,
c59145	he shall offer his sin offering,
c59146	saith the Lord GOD.
c59147	And it shall be unto them for an inheritance:
c59148	I <i>am</i> their inheritance:
c59149	and ye shall give them no possession in Israel:
c59150	I <i>am</i> their possession.
c59151	the meat offering, and the sin offering, and the trespass offering;
c59152	They shall eat
c59153	and every dedicated thing in Israel shall be theirs.
c59154	And the first of all the firstfruits of all <i>things,</i> and every oblation of all, of every <i>sort</i> of your oblations, shall be the priest's:
c59155	ye shall also give unto the priest the first of your dough,
c59156	that he may cause the blessing to rest in thine house.
c59157	The priests shall not eat of any thing that is dead of itself, or torn, whether it be fowl or beast.
c59159	Moreover, when ye shall divide by lot the land for inheritance,
c59160	ye shall offer an oblation unto the LORD, an holy portion of the land:
c59161	the length <i>shall be</i> the length of five and twenty thousand
c59162	<i>reeds,</i> and the breadth <i>shall be</i> ten thousand.
c59163	This <i>shall be</i> holy in all the borders thereof round about.
c59164	Of this there shall be for the sanctuary five hundred <i>in length,</i> with five hundred
c59165	<i>in breadth,</i> square round about;
c59166	and fifty cubits
c59167	round about for the suburbs thereof.
c59168	And of this measure shalt thou measure the length of five and twenty thousand, and the breadth of ten thousand:
c59169	and in it shall be the sanctuary <i>and</i> the most holy <i>place.</i>
c59170	The holy <i>portion</i> of the land
c59171	shall be for the priests the ministers of the sanctuary,
c59172	which shall come near
c59173	to minister unto the LORD:
c59174	and it shall be a place for their houses, and an holy place for the sanctuary.
c59175	And the five and twenty thousand of length, and the ten thousand of breadth,
c59176	shall also the Levites, the ministers of the house, have
c59177	for themselves, for a possession
c59178	for twenty chambers.
c59179	And ye shall appoint the possession of the city five thousand broad, and five and twenty thousand long, over against the oblation of the holy
c59180	<i>portion:</i> it shall be for the whole house of Israel.
c59181	And a <i>portion shall be</i> for the prince
c59182	on the one side and on the other side of the oblation of the holy <i>portion,</i> and of the possession of the city, before the oblation of the holy <i>portion,</i> and before the possession of the city, from the west side westward, and from the east side eastward:
c59183	and the length <i>shall be</i> over against one of the portions, from the west border unto the east border.
c59184	In the land shall be
c59185	his possession in Israel:
c59186	and my princes shall no more oppress my people;
c59187	and <i>the rest of</i> the land shall they give to the house of Israel according to their tribes.
c59188	Thus saith the Lord GOD; Let it suffice
c59190	you, O princes of Israel:
c59191	remove violence and spoil,
c59192	and execute judgment and justice,
c59193	take away your exactions from my people, saith
c59194	the Lord GOD.
c59195	Ye shall have just balances, and a just ephah, and a just bath.
c59196	The ephah and the bath shall be of one measure,
c59197	that the bath may contain the tenth part of an homer,
c59198	and the ephah the tenth part of an homer:
c59199	the measure thereof shall be after the homer.
c59200	And the shekel <i>shall be</i> twenty gerahs:
c59201	twenty shekels, five and twenty shekels, fifteen shekels, shall be your maneh.
c59202	This <i>is</i> the oblation
c59203	that ye shall offer;
c59204	the sixth part of an ephah of an homer of wheat,
c59205	and ye shall give the sixth part of an ephah of an homer of barley:
c59206	Concerning the ordinance of oil, the bath
c59207	of oil, <i>ye shall offer</i> the tenth part of a bath out of the cor,
c59208	<i>which is</i> an homer of ten baths;
c59209	for ten baths <i>are</i> an homer:
c59210	And one lamb out of the flock, out of two hundred, out of the fat pastures of Israel; for a meat offering, and for a burnt offering, and for peace offerings,
c59211	to make reconciliation for
c59212	them, saith the Lord GOD.
c59213	All the people of the land shall give this oblation for the prince in Israel.
c59214	And it shall be the prince's part <i>to give</i> burnt offerings, and meat offerings, and drink offerings, in the feasts, and in the new moons, and in the sabbaths, in all solemnities of the house of Israel:
c59215	he shall prepare the sin offering, and the meat offering, and the burnt offering, and the peace offerings,
c59216	to make reconciliation for the house of Israel.
c59217	Thus saith the Lord GOD;
c59218	In the first <i>month,</i> in the first <i>day</i> of the month, thou shalt take a young bullock without blemish,
c59219	and cleanse the sanctuary:
c59220	And the priest shall take of the blood of the sin offering,
c59221	and put <i>it</i> upon the posts of the house, and upon the four corners of the settle of the altar, and upon the posts of the gate of the inner court.
c59222	And so thou shalt do the seventh <i>day</i> of the month for every one that erreth, and for <i>him that is</i> simple:
c59223	so shall ye reconcile the house.
c59224	In the first <i>month,</i> in the fourteenth day of the month, ye shall have the passover,
c59225	a feast of seven days;
c59226	unleavened bread shall be eaten.
c59227	And upon that day shall the prince prepare for himself and for all the people of the land a bullock <i>for</i> a sin offering.
c59228	And seven days of the feast he shall prepare a burnt offering to the LORD, seven bullocks and seven rams without blemish daily the seven days;
c59229	and a kid of the goats daily <i>for</i> a sin offering.
c59230	And he shall prepare a meat offering of an ephah for a bullock, and an ephah for a ram,
c59231	and an hin of oil for an ephah.
c59232	In the seventh <i>month,</i> in the fifteenth day of the month, shall he do the like in the feast of the seven days, according to the sin offering, according to the burnt offering, and according to the meat offering, and according to the oil.
c59233	Thus saith the Lord GOD;
c59234	The gate of the inner court
c59235	that looketh toward the east
c59236	shall be shut the six working days;
c59237	but on the sabbath it shall be opened,
c59238	and in the day of the new moon it shall be opened.
c59239	And the prince shall enter by the way of the porch of <i>that</i> gate without,
c59240	and shall stand by the post of the gate,
c59241	and the priests shall prepare his burnt offering and his peace offerings,
c59242	and he shall worship at the threshold of the gate:
c59243	then he shall go forth;
c59244	but the gate shall not be shut until the evening.
c59245	Likewise the people of the land shall worship at the door of this gate before the LORD in the sabbaths and in the new moons.
c59246	And the burnt offering
c59247	that the prince shall offer unto the LORD
c59248	in the sabbath day <i>shall be</i> six lambs without blemish, and a ram without blemish.
c59249	And the meat offering <i>shall be</i> an ephah for a ram,
c59250	and the meat offering for the lambs as he shall be able to give,
c59251	and an hin of oil to an ephah.
c59252	And in the day of the new moon <i>it shall be</i> a young bullock without blemish, and six lambs, and a ram: they shall be without blemish.
c59253	And he shall prepare a meat offering, an ephah for a bullock, and an ephah for a ram,
c59254	and for the lambs
c59255	according as his hand shall attain
c59256	unto, and an hin of oil to an ephah.
c59258	And when the prince shall enter,
c59259	he shall go in by the way of the porch of <i>that</i> gate,
c59260	and he shall go forth by the way thereof.
c59262	But when the people of the land shall come before the LORD in the solemn feasts,
c59263	he that entereth in by the way of the north gate
c59264	to worship
c59265	shall go out by the way of the south gate;
c59267	and he that entereth by the way of the south gate
c59268	shall go forth by the way of the north gate:
c59269	he shall not return by the way of the gate
c59270	whereby he came in,
c59271	but shall go forth over against it.
c59272	And the prince in the midst
c59273	of them, when they go in,
c59274	shall go in;
c59276	and when they go forth,
c59277	shall go forth.
c59278	And in the feasts and in the solemnities the meat offering shall be an ephah to a bullock, and an ephah to a ram,
c59279	and to the lambs as he is able to give,
c59280	and an hin of oil to an ephah.
c59281	Now when the prince shall prepare a voluntary burnt offering or peace offerings voluntarily unto the LORD,
c59282	<i>one</i> shall then open him the gate
c59283	that looketh toward the east,
c59284	and he shall prepare his burnt offering and his peace offerings,
c59285	as he did on the sabbath day:
c59286	then he shall go forth;
c59287	<i>one</i> shall shut the gate.
c59288	and after his going forth
c59289	Thou shalt daily prepare a burnt offering unto the LORD <i>of</i> a lamb of the first year without blemish:
c59290	thou shalt prepare it every morning.
c59291	And thou shalt prepare a meat offering for it every morning, the sixth part of an ephah,
c59292	and the third part of an hin of oil,
c59293	to temper with the fine flour;
c59294	a meat offering continually by a perpetual ordinance unto the LORD.
c59296	Thus shall they prepare the lamb, and the meat offering, and the oil, every morning
c59297	<i>for</i> a continual burnt offering.
c59298	Thus saith the Lord GOD;
c59299	If the prince give a gift unto any of his sons,
c59300	the inheritance thereof shall be his sons'; it
c59302	<i>shall be</i> their possession by inheritance.
c59303	But if he give a gift of his inheritance to one of his servants,
c59304	then it shall be his to the year of liberty;
c59305	after it shall return to the prince:
c59306	but his inheritance
c59307	his sons' for them.
c59308	shall be
c59309	Moreover the prince shall not take of the people's inheritance by oppression,
c59310	to thrust them out of their possession;
c59311	<i>but</i> he shall give his sons inheritance out of his own possession:
c59312	that my people be not scattered
c59313	every man from his possession.
c59314	After he brought me through the entry,
c59315	which <i>was</i> at the side of the gate,
c59316	into the holy chambers of the priests,
c59317	which looked toward the north:
c59318	and, behold,
c59319	there <i>was</i> a place on the two sides westward.
c59320	Then said he unto
c59321	me, This <i>is</i> the place
c59322	where the priests shall boil the trespass offering and the sin offering,
c59323	where they shall bake the meat offering;
c59324	that they bear <i>them</i> not out into the utter court,
c59325	to sanctify the people.
c59326	Then he brought me forth into the utter court,
c59327	and caused me to pass by the four corners of the court;
c59328	and, behold,
c59329	in every corner of the court
c59330	<i>there was</i> a court.
c59331	In the four corners of the court <i>there were</i> courts joined
c59332	of forty <i>cubits</i> long
c59333	and thirty broad:
c59334	these four corners <i>were</i> of one measure.
c59335	And <i>there was</i> a row <i>of building</i> round about in them, round about them four,
c59336	and <i>it was</i> made with boiling places under the rows round about.
c59337	Then said he unto
c59338	me, These <i>are</i> the places of them that boil,
c59339	where the ministers of the house shall boil the sacrifice of the people.
c59340	Afterward he brought me again unto the door of the house;
c59341	and, behold,
c59342	waters issued out from under the threshold of the house eastward:
c59343	for the forefront of the house <i>stood toward</i> the east,
c59344	and the waters came down from under from the right side of the house, at the south <i>side</i> of the altar.
c59345	Then brought he me out of the way of the gate northward,
c59346	and led me about the way without unto the utter gate
c59347	by the way that looketh eastward;
c59348	and, behold,
c59349	there ran out waters on the right side.
c59350	And when the man that had the line in his hand went forth eastward,
c59352	he measured a thousand cubits,
c59353	and he brought me through the waters; the waters <i>were</i> to the ankles.
c59354	Again he measured a thousand,
c59355	and brought me through the waters; the waters <i>were</i> to the knees.
c59356	Again he measured a thousand,
c59357	and brought me through; the waters <i>were</i> to the loins.
c59358	Afterward he measured a thousand;
c59359	<i>and it was</i> a river
c59360	that I could not
c59361	pass over:
c59362	for the waters were risen,
c59363	waters to swim in,
c59364	a river
c59365	that could not be passed over.
c59366	And he said unto
c59367	hast thou seen
c59368	me, Son of man,
c59369	<i>this?</i> Then he brought
c59370	me, and caused me to return to the brink of the river.
c59371	Now when I had returned,
c59372	behold,
c59373	at the bank of the river <i>were</i> very many trees on the one side and on the other.
c59374	Then said he unto
c59375	me, These waters issue out toward the east country,
c59376	and go down into the desert,
c59377	and go into the sea:
c59378	<i>which being</i> brought forth into the sea,
c59379	the waters shall be healed.
c59380	And it shall come to pass,
c59381	<i>that</i> every thing that liveth,
c59382	which moveth,
c59383	whithersoever
c59384	the rivers shall come,
c59385	shall live:
c59386	and there shall be
c59387	a very great multitude of fish,
c59388	because these waters shall come thither:
c59389	for they shall be healed;
c59390	and every thing shall live
c59391	whither the river cometh.
c59392	And it shall come to pass,
c59393	<i>that</i> the fishers shall stand upon it from Engedi even unto Eneglaim;
c59394	they shall be a <i>place</i> to spread forth nets;
c59395	their fish shall be according to their kinds,
c59396	as the fish of the great sea, exceeding many.
c59397	But the miry places thereof and the marishes
c59398	thereof shall not be healed;
c59399	they shall be given to salt.
c59400	And by the river upon the bank thereof, on this side and on that side, shall grow all trees for meat,
c59401	whose leaf shall not fade,
c59402	neither shall the fruit thereof be consumed:
c59403	it shall bring forth new fruit according to his months,
c59404	because their waters
c59405	they issued out of the sanctuary:
c59406	and the fruit thereof shall be for meat,
c59407	and the leaf thereof for medicine.
c59408	Thus saith the Lord GOD;
c59409	This <i>shall be</i> the border,
c59410	whereby ye shall inherit the land according to the twelve tribes of Israel:
c59411	Joseph <i>shall have two</i> portions.
c59412	And ye shall inherit
c59413	it, one as well as another:
c59414	<i>concerning</i> the which I lifted up mine hand
c59415	to give it unto your fathers:
c59416	and this land shall fall unto you for inheritance.
c59417	And this <i>shall be</i> the border of the land
c59418	toward the north side, from the great sea, the way of Hethlon,
c59419	as men go to Zedad;
c59420	Hamath, Berothah, Sibraim,
c59421	which <i>is</i> between the border of Damascus and the border of Hamath;
c59422	Hazarhatticon,
c59423	which <i>is</i> by the coast of Hauran.
c59424	And the border from the sea shall be
c59425	Hazarenan,
c59426	the border of Damascus,
c59427	and the north northward,
c59428	and the border of Hamath.
c59429	And <i>this is</i> the north side.
c59430	And the east side ye shall measure from Hauran, and from Damascus, and from Gilead, and from the land of Israel <i>by</i> Jordan, from the border unto the east sea.
c59431	And <i>this is</i> the east side.
c59432	And the south side southward, from Tamar <i>even</i> to the waters of strife <i>in</i> Kadesh,
c59433	the river to the great sea.
c59434	And <i>this is</i> the south side southward.
c59435	The west side also <i>shall be</i> the great sea from the border, till a man come over against
c59436	Hamath.
c59437	This <i>is</i> the west side.
c59438	So shall ye divide this land unto you according to the tribes of Israel.
c59439	And it shall come to pass,
c59440	<i>that</i> ye shall divide it by lot for an inheritance unto you, and to the strangers
c59441	that sojourn among
c59442	you, which shall beget children among
c59443	you: and they shall be unto you as born in the country among the children of Israel;
c59444	they shall have inheritance with you among the tribes of Israel.
c59445	And it shall come to pass,
c59447	<i>that</i> in what tribe the stranger sojourneth, there
c59448	shall ye give <i>him</i> his inheritance,
c59449	saith the Lord GOD.
c59450	Now these <i>are</i> the names of the tribes.
c59451	From the north end to the coast of the way of Hethlon,
c59452	as one goeth to Hamath,
c59453	Hazarenan,
c59454	the border of Damascus northward, to the coast of Hamath;
c59455	for these are his sides east <i>and</i> west;
c59456	a <i>portion for</i> Dan.
c59457	And by the border of Dan, from the east side unto the west side, a <i>portion for</i> Asher.
c59458	And by the border of Asher, from the east side even unto the west side, a <i>portion for</i> Naphtali.
c59459	And by the border of Naphtali, from the east side unto the west side, a <i>portion for</i> Manasseh.
c59460	And by the border of Manasseh, from the east side unto the west side, a <i>portion for</i> Ephraim.
c59461	And by the border of Ephraim, from the east side even unto the west side, a <i>portion for</i> Reuben.
c59462	And by the border of Reuben, from the east side unto the west side, a <i>portion for</i> Judah.
c59463	And by the border of Judah, from the east side unto the west side, shall be the offering
c59464	which ye shall offer
c59465	of five and twenty thousand <i>reeds in</i> breadth,
c59466	and <i>in</i> length as one of the <i>other</i> parts, from the east side unto the west side:
c59467	and the sanctuary shall be in the midst of it.
c59468	The oblation
c59469	that ye shall offer unto the LORD
c59470	<i>shall be</i> of five and twenty thousand in length,
c59471	and of ten thousand in breadth.
c59472	And for them, <i>even</i> for the priests, shall be <i>this</i> holy oblation;
c59473	toward the north five and twenty thousand
c59474	<i>in length,</i> and toward the west ten thousand in breadth,
c59475	and toward the east ten thousand in breadth,
c59476	and toward the south five and twenty thousand in length:
c59477	and the sanctuary of the LORD shall be in the midst thereof.
c59478	<i>It shall be</i> for the priests that are sanctified of the sons of Zadok;
c59479	which have kept my charge,
c59480	which went not astray
c59481	when the children of Israel went astray,
c59482	as the Levites went astray.
c59483	And <i>this</i> oblation of the land that is offered shall be
c59484	unto them a thing most holy by the border of the Levites.
c59485	And over against the border of the priests the Levites
c59486	<i>shall have</i> five and twenty thousand in length,
c59487	and ten thousand in breadth:
c59488	all the length <i>shall be</i> five and twenty thousand,
c59489	and the breadth ten thousand.
c59490	And they shall not sell of
c59491	it, neither exchange,
c59492	nor alienate the firstfruits of the land:
c59493	for <i>it is</i> holy unto the LORD.
c59494	And the five thousand,
c59495	that are left in the breadth over against the five and twenty thousand,
c59496	shall be a profane <i>place</i> for the city, for dwelling, and for suburbs:
c59497	and the city shall be in the midst thereof.
c59498	And these <i>shall be</i> the measures
c59499	thereof; the north side four thousand and five hundred,
c59500	and the south side four thousand and five hundred,
c59501	and on the east side four thousand and five hundred,
c59502	and the west side four thousand and five hundred.
c59503	And the suburbs of the city shall be
c59504	toward the north two hundred and fifty,
c59505	and toward the south two hundred and fifty,
c59506	and toward the east two hundred and fifty,
c59507	and toward the west two hundred and fifty.
c59509	And the residue in length over against the oblation of the holy
c59510	<i>portion shall be</i> ten thousand eastward,
c59511	and ten thousand westward:
c59512	and it shall be over against the oblation of the holy
c59513	<i>portion;</i> and the increase thereof shall be for food unto them that serve the city.
c59515	And they that serve the city
c59516	shall serve it out of all the tribes of Israel.
c59517	All the oblation <i>shall be</i> five and twenty thousand by five and twenty thousand:
c59518	ye shall offer the holy oblation foursquare, with the possession of the city.
c59520	And the residue
c59521	<i>shall be</i> for the prince,
c59522	on the one side and on the other of the holy oblation, and of the possession of the city, over against the five and twenty thousand of the oblation toward the east border, and westward over against the five and twenty thousand toward the west border, over against the portions for the prince:
c59523	and it shall be the holy oblation; and the sanctuary of the house <i>shall be</i> in the midst thereof.
c59524	Moreover from the possession of the Levites, and from the possession of the city, <i>being</i> in the midst
c59525	<i>of that</i> which is the prince's,
c59526	between the border of Judah and the border of Benjamin, shall be for the prince.
c59527	As for the rest of the tribes,
c59528	from the east side unto the west side, Benjamin <i>shall have</i> a <i>portion.</i>
c59529	And by the border of Benjamin, from the east side unto the west side, Simeon <i>shall have</i> a <i>portion.</i>
c59530	And by the border of Simeon, from the east side unto the west side, Issachar a <i>portion.</i>
c59531	And by the border of Issachar, from the east side unto the west side, Zebulun a <i>portion.</i>
c59532	And by the border of Zebulun, from the east side unto the west side, Gad a <i>portion.</i>
c59533	And by the border of Gad, at the south side southward,
c59534	the border shall be even from Tamar <i>unto</i> the waters of strife <i>in</i> Kadesh,
c59535	<i>and</i> to the river toward the great sea.
c59536	This <i>is</i> the land
c59537	which ye shall divide by lot unto the tribes of Israel for inheritance,
c59538	and these <i>are</i> their portions,
c59539	saith the Lord GOD.
c59540	And these <i>are</i> the goings out of the city
c59541	on the north side, four thousand and five hundred measures.
c59542	And the gates of the city <i>shall be</i> after the names of the tribes of Israel:
c59543	three gates northward;
c59544	one gate of Reuben,
c59545	one gate of Judah,
c59546	one gate of Levi.
c59547	And at the east side four thousand and five hundred:
c59548	and three gates;
c59549	and one gate of Joseph,
c59550	one gate of Benjamin,
c59551	one gate of Dan.
c59552	And at the south side four thousand and five hundred measures:
c59553	and three gates;
c59554	one gate of Simeon,
c59555	one gate of Issachar,
c59556	one gate of Zebulun.
c59557	At the west side four thousand and five hundred,
c59558	<i>with</i> their three gates;
c59559	one gate of Gad,
c59560	one gate of Asher,
c59561	one gate of Naphtali.
c59562	<i>It was</i> round about eighteen thousand
c59563	<i>measures:</i> and the name of the city from <i>that</i> day
c59564	<i>shall be,</i> The LORD <i>is</i> there.
c59565	The word of the LORD
c59566	that came unto Hosea, the son of Beeri, in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, <i>and</i> Hezekiah, kings of Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam the son of Joash, king of Israel.
c59567	The beginning
c59568	of the word of the LORD by Hosea.
c59569	And the LORD said to Hosea,
c59570	Go,
c59571	take unto thee a wife of whoredoms and children of whoredoms:
c59572	for the land hath committed great whoredom, <i>departing</i> from the LORD.
c59573	So he went
c59574	and took Gomer the daughter of Diblaim;
c59575	which conceived,
c59576	and bare him a son.
c59577	And the LORD said unto
c59578	him, Call his name Jezreel;
c59579	for yet a little
c59580	<i>while,</i> and I will avenge the blood of Jezreel upon the house of Jehu,
c59581	and will cause to cease the kingdom of the house of Israel.
c59582	And it shall come to pass at that day,
c59583	that I will break the bow of Israel in the valley of Jezreel.
c59584	And she conceived again,
c59585	and bare a daughter.
c59586	And <i>God</i> said
c59587	unto him, Call her name Loruhamah:
c59588	for I will no more
c59589	have mercy upon the house of Israel;
c59590	but I will utterly take them away.
c59591	But I will have mercy upon the house of Judah,
c59592	and will save them by the LORD their God,
c59593	and will not save them by bow, nor by sword, nor by battle, by horses, nor by horsemen.
c59594	Now when she had weaned Loruhamah,
c59595	she conceived,
c59596	and bare a son.
c59597	Then said
c59598	<i>God,</i> Call his name Loammi:
c59599	for ye <i>are</i> not my people,
c59600	and I will not be your <i>God.</i>
c59601	Yet the number of the children of Israel shall be as the sand of the sea,
c59602	which cannot be measured
c59603	nor numbered;
c59604	and it shall come to pass,
c59605	<i>that</i> in the place
c59606	where it was said
c59607	unto them, Ye <i>are</i> not my people,
c59608	<i>there</i> it shall be said
c59609	unto them, <i>Ye are</i> the sons of the living God.
c59610	Then shall the children of Judah and the children of Israel be gathered together,
c59611	and appoint themselves one head,
c59612	and they shall come up out of the land:
c59613	for great <i>shall be</i> the day of Jezreel.
c59614	Say ye unto your brethren,
c59615	Ammi;
c59616	and to your sisters,
c59617	Ruhamah.
c59618	Plead with your mother,
c59619	plead:
c59620	for she <i>is</i> not my wife,
c59621	neither <i>am</i> I her husband:
c59622	let her therefore put away her whoredoms out of her sight,
c59623	and her adulteries from between her breasts;
c59624	Lest I strip her naked,
c59625	and set her as in the day
c59626	that she was born,
c59627	and make her as a wilderness,
c59628	and set her like a dry land,
c59629	and slay her with thirst.
c59630	And I will not have mercy upon her children;
c59631	for they <i>be</i> the children of whoredoms.
c59632	For their mother hath played the harlot:
c59633	she that conceived them hath done shamefully:
c59634	for she said,
c59635	I will go after my lovers, that give <i>me</i> my bread and my water, my wool and my flax, mine oil and my drink.
c59636	Therefore,
c59637	behold, I will hedge up thy way with thorns,
c59638	and make a wall,
c59639	that she shall not find her paths.
c59640	And she shall follow after her lovers,
c59641	but she shall not overtake
c59642	them; and she shall seek
c59643	them, but shall not find
c59644	<i>them:</i> then shall she say,
c59645	I will go
c59646	and return to my first husband;
c59647	for then <i>was it</i> better with me than now.
c59648	For she did not know
c59649	that I gave her corn, and wine, and oil,
c59650	and multiplied her silver
c59651	and gold, <i>which</i> they prepared for Baal.
c59652	Therefore will I return,
c59653	and take away my corn in the time
c59654	thereof, and my wine in the season
c59655	thereof, and will recover my wool and my flax
c59656	<i>given</i> to cover her nakedness.
c59657	And now
c59658	will I discover her lewdness in the sight of her lovers,
c59659	and none shall deliver her out of mine hand.
c59660	I will also cause all her mirth to cease, her feast days, her new moons, and her sabbaths, and all her solemn feasts.
c59661	And I will destroy her vines and her fig trees,
c59662	whereof she hath said,
c59663	These <i>are</i> my rewards
c59664	that my lovers have given
c59665	me: and I will make them a forest,
c59666	and the beasts of the field shall eat them.
c59667	And I will visit upon her the days of Baalim,
c59668	wherein she burned incense
c59669	to them, and she decked herself with her earrings and her jewels,
c59670	and she went after her lovers,
c59671	and forgat
c59672	me, saith the LORD.
c59673	Therefore,
c59674	behold, I will allure
c59675	her, and bring her into the wilderness,
c59676	and speak comfortably unto her.
c59677	And I will give her her vineyards from thence,
c59678	and the valley of Achor for a door of hope:
c59679	and she shall sing there, as in the days of her youth, and as in the day
c59680	when she came up out of the land of Egypt.
c59681	And it shall be
c59682	at that day,
c59683	saith the LORD,
c59684	<i>that</i> thou shalt call
c59685	me Ishi;
c59686	and shalt call me no more
c59687	Baali.
c59688	For I will take away the names of Baalim out of her mouth,
c59689	and they shall no more be remembered by their name.
c59690	And in that day will I make a covenant for them with the beasts of the field, and with the fowls of heaven, and <i>with</i> the creeping things of the ground:
c59691	and I will break the bow and the sword and the battle out of the earth,
c59692	and will make them to lie down safely.
c59693	And I will betroth thee unto me for ever;
c59694	yea, I will betroth thee unto me in righteousness, and in judgment, and in lovingkindness, and in mercies.
c59695	I will even betroth thee unto me in faithfulness:
c59696	and thou shalt know the LORD.
c59697	And it shall come to pass
c59698	in that day, I will hear,
c59699	saith the LORD,
c59700	I will hear the heavens,
c59701	and they shall hear the earth;
c59702	And the earth shall hear the corn, and the wine, and the oil;
c59703	and they shall hear Jezreel.
c59704	And I will sow her unto me in the earth;
c59705	and I will have mercy upon her that had not obtained mercy;
c59706	and I will say to <i>them which were</i> not my people,
c59707	Thou <i>art</i> my people;
c59708	and they shall say,
c59709	<i>Thou art</i> my God.
c59710	Then said the LORD unto
c59711	me, Go yet,
c59712	love a woman
c59713	beloved of <i>her</i> friend,
c59714	yet an adulteress,
c59715	according to the love of the LORD toward the children of Israel,
c59716	who look to other gods,
c59717	and love flagons of wine.
c59718	So I bought her to me for fifteen <i>pieces</i> of silver, and <i>for</i> an homer of barley, and an half homer of barley:
c59719	And I said unto
c59720	her, Thou shalt abide for me many days;
c59721	thou shalt not play the harlot,
c59722	and thou shalt not be for <i>another</i> man:
c59723	so <i>will</i> I also <i>be</i> for thee.
c59724	For the children of Israel shall abide many days
c59725	without a king,
c59726	and without a prince,
c59727	and without a sacrifice,
c59728	and without an image,
c59729	and without an ephod, and <i>without</i> teraphim:
c59730	Afterward shall the children of Israel return,
c59731	and seek the LORD their God, and David their king;
c59732	and shall fear the LORD and his goodness in the latter days.
c59733	Hear the word of the LORD,
c59734	ye children of Israel:
c59735	for the LORD hath a controversy with the inhabitants of the land,
c59736	because <i>there is</i> no truth,
c59737	nor mercy,
c59738	nor knowledge of God in the land.
c59739	By swearing,
c59740	and lying,
c59741	and killing,
c59742	and stealing,
c59743	and committing adultery,
c59744	they break out,
c59745	and blood toucheth blood.
c59746	Therefore shall the land mourn,
c59747	and every one that dwelleth therein shall languish,
c59749	with the beasts of the field, and with the fowls of heaven;
c59750	yea, the fishes of the sea also shall be taken away.
c59751	Yet let no man strive,
c59752	nor reprove another:
c59753	for thy people <i>are</i> as they that strive with the priest.
c59754	Therefore shalt thou fall in the day,
c59755	and the prophet also shall fall with thee in the night,
c59756	and I will destroy thy mother.
c59757	My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge:
c59758	because thou hast rejected knowledge,
c59759	I will also reject
c59760	thee, that thou shalt be no priest
c59761	to me: seeing thou hast forgotten the law of thy God,
c59762	I will also forget thy children.
c59763	As they were increased,
c59764	so they sinned
c59765	against me: <i>therefore</i> will I change their glory into shame.
c59766	They eat up the sin of my people,
c59767	and they set their heart on their iniquity.
c59768	And there shall be, like people, like priest:
c59769	and I will punish them for their ways,
c59770	and reward them their doings.
c59771	For they shall eat,
c59772	and not have enough:
c59773	they shall commit whoredom,
c59774	and shall not increase:
c59775	because they have left off to take heed to the LORD.
c59777	Whoredom and wine and new wine take away the heart.
c59778	My people ask counsel at their stocks,
c59779	and their staff declareth
c59780	unto them: for the spirit of whoredoms hath caused <i>them</i> to err,
c59781	and they have gone a whoring from under their God.
c59782	They sacrifice upon the tops of the mountains,
c59783	and burn incense upon the hills, under oaks and poplars and elms,
c59784	because the shadow thereof <i>is</i> good:
c59785	therefore your daughters shall commit whoredom,
c59786	and your spouses shall commit adultery.
c59787	I will not punish your daughters
c59788	when they commit whoredom,
c59789	nor your spouses
c59790	when they commit adultery:
c59791	for themselves are separated with whores,
c59792	and they sacrifice with harlots:
c59793	therefore the people
c59794	<i>that</i> doth not understand
c59795	shall fall.
c59796	Though thou, Israel, play the harlot,
c59798	<i>yet</i> let not Judah offend;
c59799	and come not ye unto Gilgal,
c59800	neither go ye up to Bethaven,
c59801	nor swear,
c59802	The LORD liveth.
c59803	For Israel slideth back as a backsliding heifer:
c59804	now the LORD will feed them as a lamb in a large place.
c59805	Ephraim <i>is</i> joined to idols:
c59806	let him alone.
c59807	Their drink is sour:
c59808	they have committed whoredom continually:
c59810	<i>with</i> shame do love, Give ye.
c59811	her rulers
c59812	The wind hath bound her up in her wings,
c59813	and they shall be ashamed because of their sacrifices.
c59814	Hear ye this,
c59815	O priests;
c59816	and hearken,
c59817	ye house of Israel;
c59818	O house of the king;
c59819	and give ye ear,
c59820	for judgment
c59821	<i>is</i> toward you, because ye have been a snare on Mizpah,
c59822	and a net
c59823	spread upon Tabor.
c59824	And the revolters are profound to make slaughter,
c59825	though I <i>have been</i> a rebuker of them all.
c59826	I know Ephraim,
c59827	and Israel is not hid from
c59828	me: for now, O Ephraim, thou committest whoredom,
c59830	<i>and</i> Israel is defiled.
c59831	They will not frame their doings
c59832	to turn unto their God:
c59833	for the spirit of whoredoms <i>is</i> in the midst
c59834	of them, and they have not known the LORD.
c59835	And the pride of Israel doth testify to his face:
c59836	therefore shall Israel and Ephraim fall in their iniquity;
c59837	Judah also shall fall with them.
c59838	They shall go with their flocks and with their herds
c59839	to seek the LORD;
c59840	but they shall not find
c59841	<i>him;</i> he hath withdrawn himself from them.
c59842	They have dealt treacherously against the LORD:
c59843	for they have begotten strange children:
c59844	now shall a month devour them with their portions.
c59845	Blow ye the cornet in Gibeah,
c59846	<i>and</i> the trumpet in Ramah:
c59847	cry aloud <i>at</i> Bethaven,
c59848	after
c59849	thee, O Benjamin.
c59850	Ephraim shall be desolate in the day of rebuke:
c59851	among the tribes of Israel have I made known
c59852	that which shall surely be.
c59853	The princes of Judah were like them that remove the bound:
c59854	<i>therefore</i> I will pour out my wrath upon them like water.
c59855	Ephraim <i>is</i> oppressed
c59856	<i>and</i> broken in judgment,
c59857	because he willingly
c59858	walked after the commandment.
c59859	Therefore <i>will</i> I <i>be</i> unto Ephraim as a moth,
c59860	and to the house of Judah as rottenness.
c59861	When Ephraim saw his sickness,
c59862	and Judah <i>saw</i> his wound,
c59863	then went Ephraim to the Assyrian,
c59864	and sent to king Jareb:
c59865	yet could he not
c59866	heal
c59867	you, nor cure you of your wound.
c59868	For I <i>will be</i> unto Ephraim as a lion,
c59869	and as a young lion to the house of Judah:
c59870	I, <i>even</i> I, will tear
c59871	and go away;
c59872	I will take away,
c59873	and none shall rescue <i>him.</i>
c59874	I will go
c59875	<i>and</i> return to my place,
c59876	till they acknowledge their offence,
c59877	and seek my face:
c59878	in their affliction they will seek me early.
c59879	Come,
c59880	and let us return unto the LORD:
c59881	for he hath torn,
c59882	and he will heal
c59883	us; he hath smitten,
c59884	and he will bind us up.
c59885	After two days will he revive
c59886	us: in the third day he will raise us up,
c59887	and we shall live in his sight.
c59888	Then shall we know,
c59889	<i>if</i> we follow on
c59890	to know the LORD:
c59891	his going forth is prepared as the morning;
c59892	and he shall come unto us as the rain,
c59893	as the latter <i>and</i> former rain unto the earth.
c59894	what shall I do
c59895	O Ephraim,
c59896	what shall I do
c59897	unto thee? O Judah,
c59898	unto thee? for your goodness <i>is</i> as a morning cloud, and as the early dew
c59900	it goeth away.
c59901	Therefore have I hewed <i>them</i> by the prophets;
c59902	I have slain them by the words of my mouth:
c59903	and thy judgments <i>are as</i> the light <i>that</i> goeth forth.
c59904	For I desired mercy,
c59905	and not sacrifice;
c59906	and the knowledge of God more than burnt offerings.
c59907	But they like men have transgressed the covenant:
c59908	there have they dealt treacherously against me.
c59909	Gilead <i>is</i> a city of them that work iniquity,
c59910	<i>and is</i> polluted with blood.
c59911	And as troops of robbers wait for a man, <i>so</i> the company of priests
c59912	murder in the way by consent:
c59913	for they commit lewdness.
c59914	I have seen an horrible thing in the house of Israel:
c59915	there <i>is</i> the whoredom of Ephraim,
c59916	Israel is defiled.
c59917	Also, O Judah,
c59918	he hath set an harvest
c59919	for thee, when I returned the captivity of my people.
c59920	When I would have healed Israel,
c59921	then the iniquity of Ephraim was discovered, and the wickedness of Samaria:
c59922	for they commit falsehood;
c59923	and the thief cometh in,
c59924	<i>and</i> the troop of robbers spoileth without.
c59925	And they consider not in their hearts
c59926	<i>that</i> I remember all their wickedness:
c59927	now their own doings have beset them about;
c59928	they are before my face.
c59929	They make the king glad with their wickedness,
c59930	and the princes with their lies.
c59931	They <i>are</i> all adulterers,
c59932	as an oven
c59933	heated by the baker,
c59934	<i>who</i> ceaseth
c59935	from raising
c59936	after he hath kneaded the dough,
c59937	until it be leavened.
c59938	In the day of our king the princes have made <i>him</i> sick with bottles of wine;
c59939	he stretched out his hand with scorners.
c59940	For they have made ready their heart like an oven, whiles they lie in wait:
c59941	their baker sleepeth all the night;
c59942	in the morning it burneth as a flaming fire.
c59943	They are all hot as an oven,
c59944	and have devoured their judges;
c59945	all their kings are fallen:
c59946	<i>there is</i> none among them that calleth unto me.
c59947	Ephraim,
c59948	he hath mixed himself among the people;
c59949	Ephraim is a cake
c59950	not turned.
c59951	Strangers have devoured his strength,
c59952	and he knoweth <i>it</i> not:
c59953	yea, gray hairs are here and there
c59954	upon him, yet he knoweth not.
c59955	And the pride of Israel testifieth to his face:
c59956	and they do not return to the LORD their God,
c59957	nor seek him for all this.
c59958	Ephraim also is like a silly dove
c59959	without heart:
c59960	they call to Egypt,
c59961	they go to Assyria.
c59962	When they shall go,
c59963	I will spread my net upon
c59964	them; I will bring them down as the fowls of the heaven;
c59965	I will chastise them, as their congregation hath heard.
c59966	Woe unto them! for they have fled from
c59968	me: destruction
c59969	unto them! because they have transgressed
c59970	against me: though I have redeemed them, yet they
c59971	have spoken lies against me.
c59972	And they have not cried unto me with their heart,
c59973	when they howled upon their beds:
c59974	they assemble themselves for corn and wine,
c59975	<i>and</i> they rebel against me.
c59976	Though I have bound
c59977	<i>and</i> strengthened their arms,
c59978	yet do they imagine mischief against me.
c59979	They return,
c59980	<i>but</i> not to the most High:
c59981	they are like a deceitful bow:
c59982	their princes shall fall by the sword for the rage of their tongue:
c59983	this <i>shall be</i> their derision in the land of Egypt.
c59984	<i>Set</i> the trumpet to thy mouth.
c59985	<i>He shall come</i> as an eagle against the house of the LORD,
c59986	because they have transgressed my covenant,
c59987	and trespassed against my law.
c59988	shall cry
c59989	unto me, My God,
c59990	we know thee.
c59991	Israel
c59992	Israel hath cast off <i>the thing that is</i> good:
c59993	the enemy shall pursue him.
c59994	They have set up kings,
c59995	but not by
c59996	me: they have made princes,
c59997	and I knew <i>it</i> not:
c59998	of their silver and their gold have they made them idols,
c59999	that they may be cut off.
c60000	Thy calf, O Samaria, hath cast <i>thee</i> off;
c60002	mine anger is kindled
c60003	against them: how long <i>will it be</i> ere they attain to innocency?
c60004	For from Israel
c60005	<i>was</i> it
c60006	also: the workman made
c60007	it; therefore it <i>is</i> not God:
c60008	but the calf of Samaria shall be broken in pieces.
c60009	For they have sown the wind,
c60010	and they shall reap the whirlwind:
c60011	it hath no stalk:
c60012	the bud shall yield no meal:
c60013	if so be it yield,
c60014	the strangers shall swallow it up.
c60015	Israel is swallowed up:
c60016	now shall they be among the Gentiles as a vessel
c60017	wherein <i>is</i> no pleasure.
c60018	For they are gone up to Assyria,
c60019	a wild ass
c60020	alone
c60021	by himself: Ephraim hath hired lovers.
c60022	Yea, though they have hired among the nations,
c60023	now will I gather
c60024	them, and they shall sorrow a little for the burden of the king of princes.
c60025	Because Ephraim hath made many altars
c60026	to sin,
c60027	altars shall be
c60028	unto him to sin.
c60029	I have written to him the great things of my law,
c60030	<i>but</i> they were counted as a strange thing.
c60031	<i>for</i> the sacrifices of mine offerings,
c60032	They sacrifice flesh
c60033	and eat
c60034	<i>it; but</i> the LORD accepteth them not;
c60035	now will he remember their iniquity,
c60036	and visit their sins:
c60037	they shall return to Egypt.
c60038	For Israel hath forgotten his Maker,
c60039	and buildeth temples;
c60040	and Judah hath multiplied fenced cities:
c60041	but I will send a fire upon his cities,
c60042	and it shall devour the palaces thereof.
c60043	Rejoice not,
c60044	O Israel,
c60045	for joy, as <i>other</i> people:
c60046	for thou hast gone a whoring from thy God,
c60047	thou hast loved a reward upon every cornfloor.
c60048	The floor and the winepress shall not feed
c60049	them, and the new wine shall fail in her.
c60050	They shall not dwell in the LORD'S land;
c60051	but Ephraim shall return to Egypt,
c60052	and they shall eat unclean <i>things</i> in Assyria.
c60053	They shall not offer wine <i>offerings</i> to the LORD,
c60054	neither shall they be pleasing
c60055	unto him: their sacrifices <i>shall be</i> unto them as the bread of mourners;
c60056	all that eat thereof shall be polluted:
c60057	for their bread for their soul
c60058	shall not come into the house of the LORD.
c60059	What will ye do in the solemn day,
c60060	and in the day of the feast of the LORD?
c60061	For, lo,
c60062	they are gone because of destruction:
c60063	Egypt shall gather them up,
c60064	Memphis shall bury
c60065	them: the pleasant <i>places</i> for their silver,
c60066	nettles shall possess
c60067	them: thorns <i>shall be</i> in their tabernacles.
c60068	The days of visitation are come,
c60069	the days of recompence are come;
c60070	Israel shall know
c60071	<i>it:</i> the prophet <i>is</i> a fool,
c60072	the spiritual man <i>is</i> mad,
c60073	for the multitude of thine iniquity,
c60074	and the great hatred.
c60075	The watchman of Ephraim <i>was</i> with my God:
c60076	<i>but</i> the prophet
c60077	<i>is</i> a snare of a fowler in all his ways,
c60078	<i>and</i> hatred in the house of his God.
c60079	They have deeply
c60080	corrupted <i>themselves,</i> as in the days of Gibeah:
c60081	<i>therefore</i> he will remember their iniquity,
c60082	he will visit their sins.
c60083	I found Israel like grapes in the wilderness;
c60084	I saw your fathers as the firstripe in the fig tree at her first time:
c60085	<i>but</i> they went to Baalpeor,
c60086	and separated themselves unto <i>that</i> shame;
c60087	and <i>their</i> abominations were according as they loved.
c60088	<i>As for</i> Ephraim,
c60089	their glory shall fly away like a bird,
c60090	from the birth, and from the womb, and from the conception.
c60091	Though they bring up their children,
c60092	yet will I bereave them, <i>that there shall</i> not <i>be</i> a man
c60093	<i>left:</i> yea, woe also
c60094	to them when I depart from them!
c60095	Ephraim,
c60096	as I saw
c60097	Tyrus,
c60098	<i>is</i> planted in a pleasant place:
c60099	but Ephraim
c60100	shall bring forth his children to the murderer.
c60101	Give
c60102	them, O LORD:
c60103	what wilt thou give?
c60104	give them a miscarrying womb and dry breasts.
c60105	All their wickedness <i>is</i> in Gilgal:
c60106	for there I hated
c60107	them: for the wickedness of their doings I will drive them out of mine house,
c60108	them no more:
c60109	I will love
c60110	all their princes <i>are</i> revolters.
c60111	Ephraim is smitten,
c60112	their root is dried up,
c60113	they shall bear no fruit:
c60114	yea, though they bring forth,
c60115	yet will I slay <i>even</i> the beloved <i>fruit</i> of their womb.
c60116	My God will cast them away,
c60117	because they did not hearken
c60118	unto him: and they shall be wanderers among the nations.
c60119	Israel <i>is</i> an empty vine,
c60120	he bringeth forth fruit
c60121	unto himself: according to the multitude of his fruit he hath increased the altars;
c60122	according to the goodness of his land
c60123	they have made goodly images.
c60124	Their heart is divided;
c60125	now shall they be found faulty:
c60126	he shall break down their altars,
c60127	he shall spoil their images.
c60128	For now they shall say,
c60129	We have no king,
c60130	because we feared not the LORD;
c60132	what then should a king do to us?
c60133	They have spoken words,
c60134	swearing falsely
c60135	in making a covenant:
c60136	thus judgment springeth up as hemlock in the furrows of the field.
c60137	The inhabitants of Samaria shall fear because of the calves of Bethaven:
c60138	for the people thereof shall mourn over it, and the priests
c60139	thereof <i>that</i> rejoiced on
c60140	it, for the glory
c60141	thereof, because it is departed from it.
c60142	It shall be also carried unto Assyria
c60143	<i>for</i> a present to king Jareb:
c60144	Ephraim shall receive shame,
c60145	and Israel shall be ashamed of his own counsel.
c60146	<i>As for</i> Samaria, her king is cut off
c60147	as the foam upon the water.
c60148	The high places also of Aven, the sin of Israel, shall be destroyed:
c60149	the thorn and the thistle shall come up on their altars;
c60150	and they shall say to the mountains,
c60151	Cover
c60152	us; and to the hills,
c60153	Fall on us.
c60154	thou hast sinned from the days of Gibeah:
c60155	O Israel,
c60156	there they stood:
c60157	the battle in Gibeah against the children of iniquity did not overtake them.
c60158	<i>It is</i> in my desire
c60159	that I should chastise
c60160	them; and the people shall be gathered against
c60161	them, when they shall bind themselves in their two furrows.
c60162	And Ephraim <i>is as</i> an heifer <i>that is</i> taught,
c60163	<i>and</i> loveth
c60164	to tread out
c60165	<i>the corn;</i> but I passed over upon her fair neck:
c60166	I will make Ephraim to ride;
c60167	Judah shall plow,
c60168	<i>and</i> Jacob shall break his clods.
c60169	Sow to yourselves in righteousness,
c60170	reap in mercy;
c60171	break up your fallow ground:
c60172	for <i>it is</i> time
c60173	to seek the LORD,
c60174	till he come
c60175	and rain righteousness upon you.
c60176	Ye have plowed wickedness,
c60177	ye have reaped iniquity;
c60178	ye have eaten the fruit of lies:
c60179	because thou didst trust in thy way, in the multitude of thy mighty men.
c60180	Therefore shall a tumult arise among thy people,
c60181	and all thy fortresses shall be spoiled,
c60182	as Shalman spoiled Betharbel in the day of battle:
c60183	the mother was dashed in pieces upon <i>her</i> children.
c60184	So shall Bethel do
c60186	unto you because of your great wickedness:
c60187	in a morning shall the king of Israel utterly be cut off.
c60188	When Israel <i>was</i> a child,
c60189	then I loved
c60190	him, and called my son out of Egypt.
c60191	<i>As</i> they called
c60192	them, so they went from
c60193	them: they sacrificed unto Baalim,
c60194	and burned incense to graven images.
c60195	I taught Ephraim also to go,
c60196	taking them by their arms;
c60197	but they knew not
c60198	that I healed them.
c60199	I drew them with cords of a man,
c60200	with bands of love:
c60201	and I was to them as they that take off the yoke on their jaws,
c60202	and I laid meat unto them.
c60204	He shall not return into the land of Egypt,
c60205	but the Assyrian
c60206	shall be his king,
c60207	because they refused
c60208	to return.
c60209	And the sword shall abide on his cities,
c60210	and shall consume his branches,
c60211	and devour <i>them,</i> because of their own counsels.
c60212	And my people are bent to backsliding
c60213	from me: though they called them to the most High,
c60214	none at all would exalt <i>him.</i>
c60215	How shall I give thee up,
c60216	Ephraim?
c60217	<i>how</i> shall I deliver
c60218	thee, Israel?
c60219	how shall I make thee as Admah?
c60220	<i>how</i> shall I set thee as Zeboim?
c60221	mine heart is turned within
c60222	me, my repentings are kindled together.
c60223	I will not execute the fierceness of mine anger,
c60224	I will not return
c60225	to destroy Ephraim:
c60226	for I <i>am</i> God,
c60227	and not man;
c60228	the Holy One in the midst
c60229	of thee: and I will not enter into the city.
c60230	They shall walk after the LORD:
c60231	he shall roar like a lion:
c60232	when he shall roar,
c60233	then the children shall tremble from the west.
c60234	They shall tremble as a bird out of Egypt,
c60235	and as a dove out of the land of Assyria:
c60236	and I will place them in their houses,
c60237	saith the LORD.
c60238	Ephraim compasseth me about with lies,
c60239	and the house of Israel with deceit:
c60240	but Judah yet ruleth with God,
c60241	and is faithful with the saints.
c60242	Ephraim feedeth on wind,
c60243	and followeth after the east wind: he daily
c60244	increaseth lies and desolation;
c60245	and they do make a covenant with the Assyrians,
c60246	and oil is carried into Egypt.
c60247	The LORD hath also a controversy with Judah,
c60248	and will punish Jacob according to his ways;
c60249	according to his doings will he recompense him.
c60250	He took his brother by the heel in the womb,
c60251	and by his strength he had power with God:
c60252	Yea, he had power over the angel,
c60253	and prevailed:
c60254	he wept,
c60255	and made supplication
c60256	unto him: he found him <i>in</i> Bethel,
c60257	and there he spake with us;
c60258	Even the LORD God of hosts;
c60259	the LORD <i>is</i> his memorial.
c60261	Therefore turn thou to thy God:
c60262	keep mercy and judgment,
c60263	and wait on thy God continually.
c60264	<i>He is</i> a merchant,
c60265	the balances of deceit <i>are</i> in his hand:
c60266	to oppress.
c60267	he loveth
c60268	And Ephraim said,
c60269	Yet I am become rich,
c60270	I have found me out substance:
c60271	<i>in</i> all my labours
c60272	they shall find none iniquity
c60273	in me that <i>were</i> sin.
c60274	And I <i>that am</i> the LORD thy God from the land of Egypt
c60275	will yet make thee to dwell in tabernacles, as in the days of the solemn feast.
c60276	I have also spoken by the prophets,
c60277	and I have multiplied visions,
c60278	and used similitudes, by the ministry of the prophets.
c60279	<i>Is there</i> iniquity <i>in</i> Gilead?
c60280	surely they are vanity:
c60281	they sacrifice bullocks in Gilgal;
c60282	yea, their altars <i>are</i> as heaps in the furrows of the fields.
c60283	And Jacob fled into the country of Syria,
c60284	and Israel served for a wife,
c60285	and for a wife he kept <i>sheep.</i>
c60286	And by a prophet the LORD brought Israel out of Egypt,
c60287	and by a prophet was he preserved.
c60288	Ephraim provoked <i>him</i> to anger most bitterly:
c60289	therefore shall he leave his blood upon
c60290	him, and his reproach shall his Lord return unto him.
c60291	When Ephraim spake
c60292	trembling,
c60293	he exalted himself in Israel;
c60294	but when he offended in Baal,
c60295	he died.
c60296	And now they sin more and more,
c60298	and have made them molten images
c60299	of their silver, <i>and</i> idols according to their own understanding,
c60300	all of it the work of the craftsmen:
c60301	they say
c60302	of them, Let the men that sacrifice
c60303	kiss the calves.
c60304	Therefore they shall be as the morning cloud, and as the early dew
c60306	that passeth away,
c60307	as the chaff
c60308	<i>that</i> is driven with the whirlwind out of the floor,
c60309	and as the smoke out of the chimney.
c60310	Yet I <i>am</i> the LORD thy God from the land of Egypt,
c60311	and thou shalt know no god but
c60312	me: for <i>there is</i> no saviour beside me.
c60313	I did know thee in the wilderness, in the land of great drought.
c60314	According to their pasture,
c60315	so were they filled;
c60316	they were filled,
c60317	and their heart was exalted;
c60318	therefore have they forgotten me.
c60319	Therefore I will be unto them as a lion:
c60320	as a leopard by the way will I observe <i>them:</i>
c60321	I will meet them as a bear <i>that is</i> bereaved
c60322	<i>of her whelps,</i> and will rend the caul of their heart,
c60323	and there will I devour them like a lion:
c60324	the wild beast shall tear them.
c60325	thou hast destroyed
c60326	O Israel,
c60327	thyself; but in me <i>is</i> thine help.
c60328	I will be thy king: where
c60329	<i>is any other</i> that may save thee in all thy cities?
c60330	and thy judges
c60331	of whom thou saidst,
c60332	Give me a king and princes?
c60333	I gave thee a king in mine anger,
c60334	and took <i>him</i> away in my wrath.
c60335	The iniquity of Ephraim <i>is</i> bound up;
c60336	his sin <i>is</i> hid.
c60337	The sorrows of a travailing woman shall come
c60338	upon him: he <i>is</i> an unwise son;
c60340	for he should not stay long
c60341	in <i>the place of</i> the breaking forth of children.
c60342	I will ransom them from the power of the grave;
c60343	I will redeem them from death:
c60344	I will be thy plagues;
c60345	O death,
c60346	I will be thy destruction:
c60347	O grave,
c60348	repentance shall be hid from mine eyes.
c60349	Though he be fruitful among <i>his</i> brethren,
c60350	an east wind shall come,
c60351	the wind of the LORD shall come up from the wilderness,
c60352	and his spring shall become dry,
c60353	and his fountain shall be dried up:
c60354	he shall spoil the treasure of all pleasant vessels.
c60355	Samaria shall become desolate;
c60356	for she hath rebelled against her God:
c60357	they shall fall by the sword:
c60358	their infants shall be dashed in pieces,
c60359	and their women with child shall be ripped up.
c60360	return
c60361	O Israel,
c60362	unto the LORD thy God;
c60363	for thou hast fallen by thine iniquity.
c60364	Take with you words,
c60365	and turn to the LORD:
c60366	say unto
c60367	him, Take away all iniquity,
c60368	and receive <i>us</i> graciously:
c60369	so will we render the calves of our lips.
c60370	Asshur shall not save
c60371	us; we will not ride upon horses:
c60372	neither will we say any more
c60373	<i>Ye are</i> our gods:
c60374	to the work of our hands,
c60375	for in thee the fatherless findeth mercy.
c60376	I will heal their backsliding,
c60377	I will love them freely:
c60378	for mine anger is turned away from him.
c60379	I will be as the dew unto Israel:
c60380	he shall grow as the lily,
c60381	and cast forth his roots as Lebanon.
c60382	His branches shall spread,
c60383	and his beauty shall be as the olive tree,
c60384	and his smell as Lebanon.
c60385	shall return;
c60386	They that dwell under his shadow
c60387	they shall revive <i>as</i> the corn,
c60388	and grow as the vine:
c60389	the scent thereof <i>shall be</i> as the wine of Lebanon.
c60390	Ephraim
c60391	<i>shall say,</i> What have I to do any more with idols?
c60392	I have heard
c60393	<i>him,</i> and observed
c60394	him: I <i>am</i> like a green fir tree.
c60395	From me is thy fruit found.
c60396	Who <i>is</i> wise,
c60397	and he shall understand these
c60398	<i>things?</i> prudent,
c60399	and he shall know
c60400	them? for the ways of the LORD <i>are</i> right,
c60401	and the just shall walk
c60402	in them: but the transgressors shall fall therein.
c60403	The word of the LORD
c60404	that came to Joel the son of Pethuel.
c60405	Hear this,
c60406	ye old men,
c60407	and give ear,
c60408	all ye inhabitants of the land.
c60409	Hath this been in your days,
c60410	or even in the days of your fathers?
c60411	Tell ye your children of
c60412	it, and <i>let</i> your children <i>tell</i> their children,
c60413	and their children another generation.
c60414	That which the palmerworm hath left hath the locust eaten;
c60415	and that which the locust hath left hath the cankerworm eaten;
c60416	and that which the cankerworm hath left hath the caterpiller eaten.
c60417	Awake,
c60418	ye drunkards,
c60419	and weep;
c60420	and howl,
c60421	all ye drinkers of wine,
c60422	because of the new wine;
c60423	for it is cut off from your mouth.
c60424	For a nation is come up upon my land,
c60425	strong,
c60426	and without number,
c60427	whose teeth <i>are</i> the teeth of a lion,
c60428	and he hath the cheek teeth of a great lion.
c60429	He hath laid my vine waste,
c60430	and barked my fig tree:
c60431	he hath made it clean bare,
c60432	and cast <i>it</i> away;
c60433	the branches thereof are made white.
c60434	Lament like a virgin girded with sackcloth for the husband of her youth.
c60435	The meat offering and the drink offering is cut off from the house of the LORD;
c60436	the priests, the LORD'S ministers, mourn.
c60437	The field is wasted,
c60438	the land mourneth;
c60439	for the corn is wasted:
c60440	the new wine is dried up,
c60441	the oil languisheth.
c60442	Be ye ashamed, O ye husbandmen;
c60443	howl, O ye vinedressers, for the wheat and for the barley;
c60444	because the harvest of the field is perished.
c60445	The vine is dried up,
c60446	and the fig tree languisheth;
c60447	the pomegranate tree, the palm tree also, and the apple tree, <i>even</i> all the trees of the field, are withered:
c60448	because joy is withered away from the sons of men.
c60449	Gird
c60450	yourselves, and lament,
c60451	ye priests:
c60452	howl,
c60453	ye ministers of the altar:
c60454	come,
c60455	lie all night in sackcloth,
c60456	ye ministers of my God:
c60457	for the meat offering and the drink offering is withholden from the house of your God.
c60458	Sanctify ye a fast,
c60459	call a solemn assembly,
c60460	gather the elders <i>and</i> all the inhabitants of the land <i>into</i> the house of the LORD your God,
c60461	and cry unto the LORD,
c60462	Alas for the day!
c60463	for the day of the LORD <i>is</i> at hand,
c60464	and as a destruction from the Almighty shall it come.
c60465	Is not the meat cut off before our eyes,
c60466	<i>yea,</i> joy and gladness from the house of our God?
c60467	The seed is rotten under their clods,
c60468	the garners are laid desolate,
c60469	the barns are broken down;
c60470	for the corn is withered.
c60471	How do the beasts groan!
c60472	the herds of cattle are perplexed,
c60473	because they have no pasture;
c60474	yea, the flocks of sheep are made desolate.
c60475	to
c60476	O LORD,
c60477	thee will I cry:
c60478	for the fire hath devoured the pastures of the wilderness,
c60479	and the flame hath burned all the trees of the field.
c60480	The beasts of the field cry also unto
c60481	thee: for the rivers of waters are dried up,
c60482	and the fire hath devoured the pastures of the wilderness.
c60483	Blow ye the trumpet in Zion,
c60484	and sound an alarm in my holy mountain:
c60485	let all the inhabitants of the land tremble:
c60486	for the day of the LORD cometh,
c60487	for <i>it is</i> nigh at hand;
c60488	A day of darkness and of gloominess,
c60489	a day of clouds and of thick darkness,
c60490	as the morning
c60491	spread upon the mountains:
c60492	a great people and a strong;
c60493	there hath not been ever the like,
c60494	neither shall be any more after it, <i>even</i> to the years of many generations.
c60495	A fire devoureth before
c60496	them; and behind them a flame burneth:
c60497	the land <i>is</i> as the garden of Eden before
c60498	them, and behind them a desolate wilderness;
c60499	yea, and nothing shall escape them.
c60500	The appearance of them <i>is</i> as the appearance of horses;
c60501	and as horsemen, so shall they run.
c60502	Like the noise of chariots on the tops of mountains shall they leap,
c60503	like the noise of a flame of fire
c60504	that devoureth the stubble,
c60505	as a strong people
c60506	set in battle array.
c60507	Before their face the people shall be much pained:
c60508	all faces shall gather blackness.
c60509	They shall run like mighty men;
c60510	they shall climb the wall like men of war;
c60512	every one on his ways,
c60513	and they shall march
c60514	and they shall not break their ranks:
c60516	another;
c60517	Neither shall one thrust
c60518	they shall walk every one in his path:
c60519	and <i>when</i> they fall upon the sword,
c60520	they shall not be wounded.
c60521	They shall run to and fro in the city;
c60522	they shall run upon the wall,
c60523	they shall climb up upon the houses;
c60524	they shall enter in at the windows like a thief.
c60525	The earth shall quake before
c60526	them; the heavens shall tremble:
c60527	the sun and the moon shall be dark,
c60528	and the stars shall withdraw their shining:
c60529	And the LORD shall utter his voice before his army:
c60530	for his camp <i>is</i> very great:
c60531	for <i>he is</i> strong that executeth his word:
c60532	for the day of the LORD <i>is</i> great
c60533	and very terrible;
c60534	and who can abide it?
c60535	Therefore also now,
c60536	saith the LORD,
c60537	turn ye <i>even</i> to me with all your heart,
c60538	and with fasting, and with weeping, and with mourning:
c60539	And rend your heart,
c60540	and not your garments,
c60541	and turn unto the LORD your God:
c60542	for he <i>is</i> gracious and merciful,
c60543	slow to anger, and of great kindness,
c60544	and repenteth him of the evil.
c60545	Who knoweth
c60546	<i>if</i> he will return
c60547	and repent,
c60548	and leave a blessing behind him; <i>even</i> a meat offering and a drink offering unto the LORD your God?
c60549	Blow the trumpet in Zion,
c60550	sanctify a fast,
c60551	call a solemn assembly:
c60552	Gather the people,
c60553	sanctify the congregation,
c60554	assemble the elders,
c60555	gather the children, and those that suck the breasts:
c60556	let the bridegroom go forth of his chamber,
c60557	and the bride out of her closet.
c60558	Let the priests, the ministers of the LORD, weep between the porch and the altar,
c60559	and let them say,
c60560	Spare
c60561	O LORD,
c60562	thy people,
c60563	and give not thine heritage to reproach,
c60564	that the heathen should rule
c60565	over them: wherefore should they say among the people,
c60566	Where <i>is</i> their God?
c60567	Then will the LORD be jealous for his land,
c60568	and pity his people.
c60569	Yea, the LORD will answer
c60570	and say unto his people,
c60571	Behold, I will send you corn, and wine, and oil,
c60572	and ye shall be satisfied therewith:
c60573	and I will no more make you a reproach among the heathen:
c60574	But I will remove far off from you the northern
c60575	<i>army,</i> and will drive him into a land barren and desolate,
c60576	with his face toward the east sea,
c60577	and his hinder part toward the utmost sea,
c60578	and his stink shall come up,
c60579	and his ill savour shall come up,
c60580	because he hath done great things.
c60582	Fear not,
c60583	O land;
c60584	be glad
c60585	and rejoice:
c60586	for the LORD will do great things.
c60588	Be not afraid,
c60589	ye beasts of the field:
c60590	for the pastures of the wilderness do spring,
c60591	for the tree beareth her fruit,
c60592	the fig tree and the vine do yield their strength.
c60594	then, ye children of Zion,
c60595	Be glad
c60596	and rejoice in the LORD your God:
c60597	for he hath given you the former rain moderately,
c60598	and he will cause to come down for you the rain, the former rain, and the latter rain in the first <i>month.</i>
c60599	And the floors shall be full of wheat,
c60600	and the fats shall overflow with wine and oil.
c60601	And I will restore to you the years
c60602	that the locust hath eaten, the cankerworm, and the caterpiller, and the palmerworm, my great army
c60603	which I sent among you.
c60604	And ye shall eat in plenty,
c60606	and be satisfied,
c60607	and praise the name of the LORD your God,
c60608	that hath dealt wondrously with
c60610	you: and my people shall never be ashamed.
c60611	And ye shall know
c60612	that I <i>am</i> in the midst of Israel,
c60613	and <i>that</i> I <i>am</i> the LORD your God,
c60614	and none else:
c60615	and my people shall never be ashamed.
c60616	And it shall come to pass afterward,
c60617	<i>that</i> I will pour out my spirit upon all flesh;
c60618	and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy,
c60619	your old men shall dream dreams,
c60620	your young men shall see visions:
c60621	And also upon the servants and upon the handmaids in those days will I pour out my spirit.
c60622	And I will shew wonders in the heavens and in the earth,
c60623	blood, and fire, and pillars of smoke.
c60624	The sun shall be turned into darkness,
c60625	and the moon into blood,
c60626	before the great and the terrible day of the LORD come.
c60627	And it shall come to pass,
c60628	<i>that</i> whosoever
c60629	shall call on the name of the LORD
c60630	shall be delivered:
c60631	for in mount Zion and in Jerusalem shall be deliverance,
c60632	as the LORD hath said,
c60633	and in the remnant
c60634	whom the LORD shall call.
c60635	For, behold, in those days, and in that time,
c60636	when I shall bring again the captivity of Judah and Jerusalem,
c60637	I will also gather all nations,
c60638	and will bring them down into the valley of Jehoshaphat,
c60639	and will plead with them there for my people and <i>for</i> my heritage Israel,
c60640	whom they have scattered among the nations,
c60641	and parted my land.
c60642	And they have cast lots for my people;
c60643	and have given a boy for an harlot,
c60644	and sold a girl for wine,
c60645	that they might drink.
c60646	Yea, and what have ye
c60647	to do with me, O Tyre, and Zidon, and all the coasts of Palestine?
c60648	will ye render me a recompence?
c60649	and if ye recompense
c60650	me, swiftly <i>and</i> speedily will I return your recompence upon your own head;
c60651	Because ye have taken my silver and my gold,
c60652	and have carried into your temples my goodly pleasant things:
c60653	The children also of Judah and the children of Jerusalem have ye sold unto the Grecians,
c60654	that ye might remove them far from their border.
c60655	Behold, I will raise them out of the place
c60656	whither ye have sold
c60657	them, and will return your recompence upon your own head:
c60658	And I will sell your sons and your daughters into the hand of the children of Judah,
c60659	and they shall sell them to the Sabeans, to a people far off:
c60660	for the LORD hath spoken <i>it.</i>
c60661	Proclaim ye this among the Gentiles;
c60662	Prepare war,
c60663	wake up the mighty men,
c60665	let all the men of war draw near; let them come up:
c60666	Beat your plowshares into swords,
c60667	and your pruninghooks into spears:
c60668	let the weak say,
c60669	I <i>am</i> strong.
c60670	Assemble
c60671	yourselves, and come,
c60672	all ye heathen, and gather yourselves together round about:
c60674	thither cause thy mighty ones to come down,
c60675	O LORD.
c60678	Let the heathen be wakened, and come up to the valley of Jehoshaphat:
c60679	for there will I sit
c60680	to judge all the heathen round about.
c60681	Put ye in the sickle,
c60682	for the harvest is ripe:
c60683	come,
c60684	get you down;
c60685	for the press is full,
c60686	the fats overflow;
c60687	for their wickedness <i>is</i> great.
c60688	Multitudes, multitudes in the valley of decision:
c60689	for the day of the LORD <i>is</i> near in the valley of decision.
c60690	The sun and the moon shall be darkened,
c60691	and the stars shall withdraw their shining.
c60692	The LORD also shall roar out of Zion,
c60693	and utter his voice from Jerusalem;
c60694	and the heavens and the earth shall shake:
c60695	but the LORD <i>will be</i> the hope of his people,
c60696	and the strength of the children of Israel.
c60697	So shall ye know
c60698	that I <i>am</i> the LORD your God
c60699	dwelling in Zion, my holy mountain:
c60700	then shall Jerusalem be holy,
c60701	and there shall no strangers pass through her any more.
c60702	And it shall come to pass in that day,
c60703	<i>that</i> the mountains shall drop down new wine,
c60704	and the hills shall flow with milk,
c60705	and all the rivers of Judah shall flow with waters,
c60706	and a fountain shall come forth of the house of the LORD,
c60707	and shall water the valley of Shittim.
c60708	Egypt shall be a desolation,
c60709	and Edom shall be a desolate wilderness,
c60710	for the violence <i>against</i> the children of Judah,
c60711	because they have shed innocent blood in their land.
c60712	But Judah shall dwell for ever,
c60713	and Jerusalem from generation to generation.
c60714	For I will cleanse their blood
c60715	<i>that</i> I have not cleansed:
c60716	for the LORD dwelleth in Zion.
c60717	The words of Amos,
c60718	who was among the herdmen of Tekoa,
c60719	which he saw concerning Israel in the days of Uzziah king of Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam the son of Joash king of Israel, two years before the earthquake.
c60720	And he said,
c60721	The LORD will roar from Zion,
c60722	and utter his voice from Jerusalem;
c60723	and the habitations of the shepherds shall mourn,
c60724	and the top of Carmel shall wither.
c60725	Thus saith the LORD;
c60726	For three transgressions of Damascus, and for four, I will not turn away
c60727	<i>the punishment</i> thereof; because they have threshed Gilead with threshing instruments of iron:
c60728	But I will send a fire into the house of Hazael,
c60729	which shall devour the palaces of Benhadad.
c60730	I will break also the bar of Damascus,
c60731	and cut off the inhabitant from the plain of Aven,
c60732	and him that holdeth the sceptre from the house of Eden:
c60733	and the people of Syria shall go into captivity unto Kir,
c60734	saith the LORD.
c60735	Thus saith the LORD;
c60736	For three transgressions of Gaza, and for four, I will not turn away
c60737	<i>the punishment</i> thereof; because they carried away captive the whole captivity,
c60738	to deliver <i>them</i> up to Edom:
c60739	But I will send a fire on the wall of Gaza,
c60740	which shall devour the palaces thereof:
c60741	And I will cut off the inhabitant from Ashdod,
c60742	and him that holdeth the sceptre from Ashkelon,
c60743	and I will turn mine hand against Ekron:
c60744	and the remnant of the Philistines shall perish,
c60745	saith the Lord GOD.
c60746	Thus saith the LORD;
c60747	For three transgressions of Tyrus, and for four, I will not turn away
c60748	<i>the punishment</i> thereof; because they delivered up the whole captivity to Edom,
c60749	and remembered not the brotherly covenant:
c60750	But I will send a fire on the wall of Tyrus,
c60751	which shall devour the palaces thereof.
c60752	Thus saith the LORD;
c60753	For three transgressions of Edom, and for four, I will not turn away
c60754	<i>the punishment</i> thereof; because he did pursue his brother with the sword,
c60755	and did cast off all pity,
c60756	and his anger did tear perpetually,
c60758	and he kept his wrath for ever:
c60759	But I will send a fire upon Teman,
c60760	which shall devour the palaces of Bozrah.
c60761	Thus saith the LORD;
c60762	For three transgressions of the children of Ammon, and for four, I will not turn away
c60763	<i>the punishment</i> thereof; because they have ripped up the women with child of Gilead,
c60764	that they might enlarge their border:
c60765	But I will kindle a fire in the wall of Rabbah,
c60766	and it shall devour the palaces
c60767	thereof, with shouting in the day of battle,
c60768	with a tempest in the day of the whirlwind:
c60769	And their king shall go into captivity,
c60770	he and his princes together,
c60771	saith the LORD.
c60772	Thus saith the LORD;
c60773	For three transgressions of Moab, and for four, I will not turn away
c60774	<i>the punishment</i> thereof; because he burned the bones of the king of Edom into lime:
c60775	But I will send a fire upon Moab,
c60776	and it shall devour the palaces of Kerioth:
c60777	and Moab shall die with tumult, with shouting, <i>and</i> with the sound of the trumpet:
c60778	And I will cut off the judge from the midst
c60779	thereof, and will slay all the princes thereof with
c60780	him, saith the LORD.
c60781	Thus saith the LORD;
c60782	For three transgressions of Judah, and for four, I will not turn away
c60783	<i>the punishment</i> thereof; because they have despised the law of the LORD,
c60784	and have not kept his commandments,
c60785	and their lies caused them to err,
c60786	after the which their fathers have walked:
c60787	But I will send a fire upon Judah,
c60788	and it shall devour the palaces of Jerusalem.
c60789	Thus saith the LORD;
c60790	For three transgressions of Israel, and for four, I will not turn away
c60791	<i>the punishment</i> thereof; because they sold the righteous for silver,
c60792	and the poor for a pair of shoes;
c60793	That pant after the dust of the earth on the head of the poor,
c60794	and turn aside the way of the meek:
c60795	and a man and his father will go in unto the <i>same</i> maid,
c60796	to profane my holy name:
c60797	And they lay <i>themselves</i> down upon clothes laid to pledge by every altar,
c60798	and they drink the wine of the condemned <i>in</i> the house of their god.
c60799	Yet destroyed I the Amorite before
c60800	them, whose height <i>was</i> like the height of the cedars,
c60801	and he <i>was</i> strong as the oaks;
c60802	yet I destroyed his fruit from above, and his roots from beneath.
c60803	Also I brought you up from the land of Egypt,
c60804	and led you forty years through the wilderness,
c60805	to possess the land of the Amorite.
c60806	And I raised up of your sons for prophets,
c60807	and of your young men for Nazarites.
c60808	<i>Is it</i> not even thus,
c60809	O ye children of Israel?
c60810	saith the LORD.
c60811	But ye gave the Nazarites wine to drink;
c60812	and commanded the prophets,
c60813	saying,
c60814	Prophesy not.
c60815	Behold, I am pressed under
c60816	you, as a cart is pressed
c60817	<i>that is</i> full of sheaves.
c60818	Therefore the flight shall perish from the swift,
c60819	and the strong shall not strengthen his force,
c60820	neither shall the mighty deliver himself:
c60821	Neither shall he stand that handleth the bow;
c60822	and <i>he that is</i> swift of foot shall not deliver
c60823	<i>himself:</i> neither shall he that rideth the horse deliver himself.
c60824	And <i>he that is</i> courageous among the mighty shall flee away naked in that day,
c60825	saith the LORD.
c60826	Hear this word
c60827	that the LORD hath spoken against
c60828	you, O children of Israel,
c60829	against the whole family
c60830	which I brought up from the land of Egypt,
c60831	saying,
c60832	You only have I known of all the families of the earth:
c60833	therefore I will punish you for all your iniquities.
c60834	Can two walk together,
c60835	except they be agreed?
c60836	Will a lion roar in the forest,
c60837	when he hath no prey?
c60838	will a young lion cry out of his den,
c60839	if he have taken nothing?
c60840	Can a bird fall in a snare upon the earth,
c60841	where no gin
c60842	<i>is</i> for him? shall <i>one</i> take up a snare from the earth,
c60843	and have taken nothing at all?
c60844	Shall a trumpet be blown in the city,
c60845	and the people not be afraid?
c60846	shall there be evil in a city,
c60847	and the LORD hath not done <i>it?</i>
c60848	Surely the Lord GOD will do nothing,
c60849	but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets.
c60850	The lion hath roared,
c60851	who will not fear?
c60852	the Lord GOD hath spoken,
c60853	who can but prophesy?
c60854	Publish in the palaces at Ashdod,
c60855	and in the palaces in the land of Egypt,
c60856	and say,
c60857	Assemble yourselves upon the mountains of Samaria,
c60858	and behold the great tumults in the midst
c60859	thereof, and the oppressed in the midst thereof.
c60860	For they know not
c60861	to do right,
c60862	saith the LORD,
c60863	who store up violence and robbery in their palaces.
c60864	Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD;
c60865	An adversary
c60866	<i>there shall be</i> even round about the land;
c60867	and he shall bring down thy strength from
c60868	thee, and thy palaces shall be spoiled.
c60869	Thus saith the LORD;
c60870	As the shepherd taketh out of the mouth of the lion two legs, or a piece of an ear;
c60871	so shall the children of Israel be taken out
c60872	that dwell in Samaria in the corner of a bed, and in Damascus <i>in</i> a couch.
c60873	Hear
c60874	ye, and testify in the house of Jacob,
c60875	saith the Lord GOD, the God of hosts,
c60876	That in the day
c60877	that I shall visit the transgressions of Israel upon
c60878	him I will also visit the altars of Bethel:
c60879	and the horns of the altar shall be cut off,
c60880	and fall to the ground.
c60881	And I will smite the winter house with the summer house;
c60882	and the houses of ivory shall perish,
c60883	and the great houses shall have an end,
c60884	saith the LORD.
c60885	Hear this word,
c60886	ye kine of Bashan,
c60887	that <i>are</i> in the mountain of Samaria,
c60888	which oppress the poor,
c60889	which crush the needy,
c60890	which say to their masters,
c60891	Bring,
c60892	and let us drink.
c60893	The Lord GOD hath sworn by his holiness,
c60894	that, lo, the days shall come upon
c60895	you, that he will take you away with hooks,
c60896	and your posterity with fishhooks.
c60897	And ye shall go out at the breaches,
c60898	every <i>cow at that which is</i> before
c60899	her; and ye shall cast <i>them</i> into the palace,
c60900	saith the LORD.
c60901	Come to Bethel,
c60902	and transgress; at Gilgal
c60903	multiply
c60904	transgression;
c60905	and bring your sacrifices every morning,
c60906	<i>and</i> your tithes after three years:
c60907	And offer a sacrifice of thanksgiving with leaven,
c60908	and proclaim <i>and</i> publish the free offerings:
c60910	for this liketh
c60911	you, O ye children of Israel,
c60912	saith the Lord GOD.
c60913	And I also have given you cleanness of teeth in all your cities,
c60914	and want of bread in all your places:
c60915	yet have ye not returned unto
c60916	me, saith the LORD.
c60917	And also I have withholden the rain from you, when <i>there were</i> yet three months to the harvest:
c60918	and I caused it to rain upon one city,
c60919	and caused it not to rain upon another city:
c60920	one piece was rained upon,
c60921	and the piece
c60922	whereupon it rained not
c60923	withered.
c60924	So two <i>or</i> three cities wandered unto one city,
c60925	to drink water;
c60926	but they were not satisfied:
c60927	yet have ye not returned unto
c60928	me, saith the LORD.
c60929	I have smitten you with blasting and mildew:
c60930	when your gardens and your vineyards and your fig trees and your olive trees increased,
c60931	the palmerworm devoured
c60932	<i>them:</i> yet have ye not returned unto
c60933	me, saith the LORD.
c60934	I have sent among you the pestilence after the manner of Egypt:
c60935	your young men have I slain with the sword,
c60936	and have taken away your horses;
c60937	and I have made the stink of your camps to come up
c60938	unto your nostrils:
c60939	yet have ye not returned unto
c60940	me, saith the LORD.
c60941	I have overthrown <i>some</i> of you, as God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah,
c60942	and ye were as a firebrand
c60943	plucked out of the burning:
c60944	yet have ye not returned unto
c60945	me, saith the LORD.
c60946	Therefore
c60947	thus will I do
c60948	unto thee, O Israel:
c60949	<i>and</i> because I will do this
c60950	unto thee, prepare
c60951	to meet thy God,
c60952	O Israel.
c60953	For, lo,
c60954	he that formeth the mountains,
c60955	and createth the wind,
c60956	and declareth unto man
c60957	what <i>is</i> his thought,
c60958	that maketh the morning darkness,
c60959	and treadeth upon the high places of the earth,
c60960	The LORD, The God of hosts, <i>is</i> his name.
c60961	Hear ye this word
c60962	which I take up against
c60963	you, <i>even</i> a lamentation,
c60964	O house of Israel.
c60965	is fallen;
c60966	she shall no more
c60967	rise:
c60968	The virgin of Israel
c60969	she is forsaken upon her land;
c60970	<i>there is</i> none to raise her up.
c60971	For thus saith the Lord GOD;
c60972	The city
c60973	that went out <i>by</i> a thousand
c60974	shall leave an hundred,
c60976	and that which went forth <i>by</i> an hundred
c60977	shall leave ten, to the house of Israel.
c60978	For thus saith the LORD unto the house of Israel,
c60979	Seek
c60980	ye me, and ye shall live:
c60981	But seek not Bethel,
c60982	nor enter into Gilgal,
c60983	and pass not to Beersheba:
c60984	for Gilgal shall surely go into captivity,
c60985	and Bethel shall come to nought.
c60986	Seek the LORD,
c60987	and ye shall live;
c60988	lest he break out like fire in the house of Joseph,
c60989	and devour
c60990	<i>it,</i> and <i>there be</i> none to quench <i>it</i> in Bethel.
c60991	Ye who turn judgment to wormwood,
c60992	and leave off righteousness in the earth,
c60993	<i>Seek him</i> that maketh the seven stars and Orion,
c60994	and turneth the shadow of death into the morning,
c60995	and maketh the day dark with night:
c60996	that calleth for the waters of the sea,
c60997	and poureth them out upon the face of the earth:
c60998	The LORD <i>is</i> his name:
c60999	That strengtheneth the spoiled against the strong,
c61000	so that the spoiled shall come against the fortress.
c61001	They hate
c61002	him that rebuketh in the gate,
c61004	him that speaketh uprightly.
c61005	and they abhor
c61007	Forasmuch therefore as your treading <i>is</i> upon the poor,
c61008	and ye take from him burdens of wheat:
c61009	ye have built houses of hewn stone,
c61010	but ye shall not dwell
c61011	in them; ye have planted pleasant vineyards,
c61012	but ye shall not drink wine of them.
c61013	For I know
c61014	your manifold transgressions
c61015	and your mighty sins:
c61016	they afflict the just,
c61017	they take a bribe,
c61018	and they turn aside the poor in the gate <i>from their right.</i>
c61019	Therefore the prudent shall keep silence in that time;
c61020	for it <i>is</i> an evil time.
c61021	Seek good,
c61022	and not evil,
c61023	that ye may live:
c61024	and so the LORD, the God of hosts, shall be with
c61025	you, as ye have spoken.
c61026	Hate the evil,
c61027	and love the good,
c61028	and establish judgment in the gate:
c61029	it may be that the LORD God of hosts will be gracious unto the remnant of Joseph.
c61030	Therefore
c61031	the LORD, the God of hosts, the Lord, saith thus;
c61032	Wailing <i>shall be</i> in all streets;
c61033	and they shall say in all the highways,
c61034	Alas! alas!
c61035	and they shall call the husbandman to mourning,
c61036	and such as are skilful of lamentation to wailing.
c61037	And in all vineyards <i>shall be</i> wailing:
c61038	for I will pass through
c61039	thee, saith the LORD.
c61040	Woe
c61041	unto you that desire the day of the LORD!
c61042	to what end <i>is</i> it for you? the day of the LORD
c61043	<i>is</i> darkness,
c61044	and not light.
c61045	As if a man did flee from a lion,
c61046	and a bear met
c61047	him; or went into the house,
c61048	and leaned his hand on the wall,
c61049	and a serpent bit him.
c61050	<i>Shall</i> not the day of the LORD <i>be</i> darkness,
c61051	and not light?
c61052	even very dark,
c61053	and no brightness in it?
c61054	I hate,
c61055	I despise your feast days,
c61056	and I will not smell in your solemn assemblies.
c61057	Though
c61058	ye offer me burnt offerings and your meat offerings,
c61059	I will not accept
c61060	<i>them:</i> neither will I regard the peace offerings of your fat beasts.
c61061	Take thou away from me the noise of thy songs;
c61062	for I will not hear the melody of thy viols.
c61063	But let judgment run down as waters,
c61064	and righteousness as a mighty stream.
c61065	Have ye offered unto me sacrifices and offerings in the wilderness forty years,
c61066	O house of Israel?
c61067	But ye have borne the tabernacle of your Moloch and Chiun your images, the star of your god,
c61068	which ye made to yourselves.
c61069	Therefore will I cause you to go into captivity beyond Damascus,
c61070	saith the LORD,
c61071	whose name <i>is</i> The God of hosts.
c61072	Woe
c61073	to them <i>that are</i> at ease in Zion,
c61074	and trust in the mountain of Samaria,
c61075	<i>which are</i> named chief of the nations,
c61076	to whom the house of Israel came!
c61077	Pass ye unto Calneh,
c61078	and see;
c61079	and from thence go ye to Hamath the great:
c61080	then go down to Gath of the Philistines:
c61081	<i>be they</i> better than these kingdoms?
c61082	or their border greater than your border?
c61083	Ye that put far away the evil day,
c61084	and cause the seat of violence to come near;
c61085	That lie upon beds of ivory,
c61086	and stretch themselves upon their couches,
c61087	and eat the lambs out of the flock, and the calves out of the midst of the stall;
c61088	That chant to the sound of the viol,
c61089	<i>and</i> invent to themselves instruments of musick, like David;
c61090	That drink wine in bowls,
c61091	and anoint themselves with the chief ointments:
c61092	but they are not grieved for the affliction of Joseph.
c61093	Therefore
c61094	now shall they go captive with the first that go captive,
c61095	and the banquet of them that stretched themselves shall be removed.
c61096	The Lord GOD hath sworn by himself,
c61097	saith the LORD the God of hosts,
c61098	I abhor the excellency of Jacob,
c61099	and hate his palaces:
c61100	therefore will I deliver up the city with all that is therein.
c61101	And it shall come to pass,
c61102	if there remain ten men in one house,
c61103	that they shall die.
c61104	And a man's uncle shall take him up,
c61105	and he that burneth
c61106	him, to bring out the bones out of the house,
c61107	and shall say
c61108	unto him that <i>is</i> by the sides of the house,
c61109	<i>Is there</i> yet <i>any</i> with
c61110	thee? and he shall say,
c61111	No.
c61112	Then shall he say,
c61113	Hold thy tongue:
c61114	for we may not
c61115	make mention of the name of the LORD.
c61116	For, behold,
c61117	the LORD commandeth,
c61118	and he will smite the great house with breaches,
c61119	and the little house with clefts.
c61120	Shall horses run upon the rock?
c61121	will <i>one</i> plow <i>there</i> with oxen?
c61122	for ye have turned judgment into gall,
c61123	and the fruit of righteousness into hemlock:
c61124	Ye which rejoice in a thing of nought,
c61125	which say,
c61126	Have we not taken to us horns by our own strength?
c61127	But, behold, I will raise up against
c61128	O house of Israel,
c61129	saith the LORD the God of hosts;
c61130	you a nation,
c61131	and they shall afflict
c61132	you from the entering in of Hemath
c61133	unto the river of the wilderness.
c61134	Thus hath the Lord GOD shewed
c61135	unto me; and, behold, he formed grasshoppers in the beginning
c61136	of the shooting up of the latter growth;
c61137	and, lo, <i>it was</i> the latter growth after the king's mowings.
c61138	And it came to pass,
c61139	<i>that</i> when they had made an end
c61140	of eating the grass of the land,
c61141	then I said,
c61142	O Lord GOD,
c61143	forgive, I beseech thee:
c61144	by whom shall Jacob arise?
c61145	for he <i>is</i> small.
c61146	The LORD repented for this:
c61147	It shall not be,
c61148	saith the LORD.
c61149	Thus hath the Lord GOD shewed
c61150	unto me: and, behold, the Lord GOD called
c61151	to contend by fire,
c61153	and it devoured the great deep,
c61154	and did eat up a part.
c61155	Then said
c61156	I, O Lord GOD,
c61157	cease, I beseech thee:
c61158	by whom shall Jacob arise?
c61159	for he <i>is</i> small.
c61160	The LORD repented for this:
c61161	This also shall not be,
c61162	saith the Lord GOD.
c61163	Thus he shewed
c61164	me: and, behold, the Lord stood upon a wall <i>made</i> by a plumbline,
c61165	with a plumbline in his hand.
c61166	And the LORD said unto
c61167	what seest thou?
c61168	me, Amos,
c61169	And I said,
c61170	A plumbline.
c61171	Then said the Lord,
c61172	Behold, I will set a plumbline in the midst of my people Israel:
c61173	I will not again pass by them any more:
c61175	And the high places of Isaac shall be desolate,
c61176	and the sanctuaries of Israel shall be laid waste;
c61177	and I will rise against the house of Jeroboam with the sword.
c61178	Then Amaziah the priest of Bethel sent to Jeroboam king of Israel,
c61179	saying,
c61180	Amos hath conspired against thee in the midst of the house of Israel:
c61181	the land is not able
c61182	to bear all his words.
c61183	For thus Amos saith,
c61184	Jeroboam shall die by the sword,
c61185	and Israel shall surely be led away captive out of their own land.
c61186	Also Amaziah said unto Amos,
c61187	O thou seer,
c61188	go,
c61189	flee thee away into the land of Judah,
c61190	and there eat bread,
c61191	and prophesy there:
c61192	not again any more at Bethel:
c61193	But prophesy
c61194	for it <i>is</i> the king's chapel,
c61195	and it <i>is</i> the king's court.
c61196	Then answered Amos,
c61197	and said to Amaziah,
c61198	I <i>was</i> no prophet,
c61199	neither <i>was</i> I a prophet's son;
c61200	but I <i>was</i> an herdman, and a gatherer of sycomore fruit:
c61201	And the LORD took me as I followed the flock,
c61202	and the LORD said unto
c61203	me, Go,
c61204	prophesy unto my people Israel.
c61205	Now
c61206	therefore hear thou the word of the LORD:
c61207	Thou sayest,
c61208	Prophesy not against Israel,
c61209	and drop not <i>thy word</i> against the house of Isaac.
c61210	Therefore thus saith the LORD;
c61211	Thy wife shall be an harlot in the city,
c61212	and thy sons and thy daughters shall fall by the sword,
c61213	and thy land shall be divided by line;
c61214	and thou shalt die in a polluted land:
c61215	and Israel shall surely go into captivity forth of his land.
c61216	Thus hath the Lord GOD shewed
c61217	unto me: and behold a basket of summer fruit.
c61218	And he said,
c61219	what seest thou?
c61220	Amos,
c61221	And I said,
c61222	A basket of summer fruit.
c61223	Then said the LORD unto
c61224	me, The end is come upon my people of Israel;
c61225	I will not again pass by them any more.
c61227	And the songs of the temple shall be howlings in that day,
c61228	saith the Lord GOD:
c61229	<i>there shall be</i> many dead bodies
c61230	in every place; they shall cast <i>them</i> forth
c61231	with silence.
c61232	Hear this,
c61233	O ye that swallow up the needy,
c61234	even to make the poor of the land to fail,
c61235	Saying,
c61236	When will the new moon be gone,
c61237	that we may sell corn?
c61238	and the sabbath,
c61239	that we may set forth wheat,
c61240	making the ephah small,
c61241	and the shekel great,
c61242	and falsifying the balances by deceit?
c61243	That we may buy the poor for silver,
c61244	and the needy for a pair of shoes;
c61245	<i>yea,</i> and sell the refuse of the wheat?
c61246	The LORD hath sworn by the excellency of Jacob,
c61247	Surely I will never forget any of their works.
c61248	Shall not the land tremble for this,
c61249	and every one mourn
c61250	that dwelleth
c61251	therein? and it shall rise up wholly as a flood;
c61252	and it shall be cast out
c61253	and drowned, as <i>by</i> the flood of Egypt.
c61254	And it shall come to pass in that day,
c61255	saith the Lord GOD,
c61256	that I will cause the sun to go down at noon,
c61257	and I will darken the earth in the clear day:
c61258	And I will turn your feasts into mourning,
c61259	and all your songs into lamentation;
c61260	and I will bring up sackcloth upon all loins,
c61261	and baldness upon every head;
c61262	and I will make it as the mourning of an only
c61263	<i>son,</i> and the end thereof as a bitter day.
c61264	Behold, the days come,
c61265	saith the Lord GOD,
c61266	that I will send a famine in the land,
c61267	not a famine of bread,
c61268	nor a thirst for water,
c61269	but of hearing the words of the LORD:
c61270	And they shall wander from sea to sea,
c61271	and from the north even to the east, they shall run to and fro
c61272	to seek the word of the LORD,
c61273	and shall not find <i>it.</i>
c61274	In that day shall the fair virgins and young men faint for thirst.
c61275	They that swear by the sin of Samaria,
c61276	and say,
c61277	Thy god, O Dan, liveth;
c61279	and, The manner of Beersheba liveth;
c61280	even they shall fall,
c61281	and never rise up again.
c61282	I saw the Lord
c61283	standing upon the altar:
c61284	and he said,
c61285	Smite the lintel
c61286	of the door, that the posts may shake:
c61287	and cut them in the head, all
c61288	of them; and I will slay the last of them with the sword:
c61289	he that fleeth of them shall not flee away,
c61290	and he that escapeth of them shall not be delivered.
c61291	Though they dig into hell,
c61292	thence shall mine hand take
c61293	them; though they climb up to heaven,
c61294	thence will I bring them down:
c61295	And though they hide themselves in the top of Carmel,
c61296	I will search and take them out thence;
c61298	and though they be hid from my sight in the bottom of the sea,
c61299	thence will I command the serpent,
c61300	and he shall bite them:
c61301	And though they go into captivity before their enemies,
c61302	thence will I command the sword,
c61303	and it shall slay
c61304	them: and I will set mine eyes upon them for evil,
c61305	and not for good.
c61306	And the Lord GOD of hosts
c61307	<i>is</i> he that toucheth the land,
c61308	and it shall melt,
c61309	and all that dwell therein shall mourn:
c61311	and it shall rise up wholly like a flood;
c61312	and shall be drowned, as <i>by</i> the flood of Egypt.
c61313	<i>It is</i> he that buildeth his stories in the heaven,
c61314	and hath founded his troop in the earth;
c61315	he that calleth for the waters of the sea,
c61316	and poureth them out upon the face of the earth:
c61317	The LORD <i>is</i> his name.
c61318	<i>Are</i> ye not as children of the Ethiopians
c61319	unto me, O children of Israel?
c61320	saith the LORD.
c61321	Have not I brought up Israel out of the land of Egypt?
c61322	and the Philistines from Caphtor,
c61323	and the Syrians from Kir?
c61324	Behold, the eyes of the Lord GOD <i>are</i> upon the sinful kingdom,
c61325	and I will destroy it from off the face of the earth;
c61326	saving that I will not utterly destroy the house of Jacob,
c61327	saith the LORD.
c61328	For, lo, I will command,
c61329	and I will sift the house of Israel among all nations,
c61330	like as <i>corn</i> is sifted in a sieve,
c61331	yet shall not the least grain fall upon the earth.
c61332	All the sinners of my people shall die by the sword,
c61333	which say,
c61335	The evil shall not overtake nor prevent us.
c61336	In that day will I raise up the tabernacle of David
c61337	that is fallen,
c61338	and close up the breaches
c61339	thereof; and I will raise up his ruins,
c61340	and I will build it as in the days of old:
c61341	That they may possess the remnant of Edom, and of all the heathen,
c61342	which are called by my name,
c61343	saith the LORD
c61344	that doeth this.
c61345	Behold, the days come,
c61346	saith the LORD,
c61347	that the plowman shall overtake the reaper,
c61348	and the treader of grapes him that soweth seed;
c61349	and the mountains shall drop sweet wine,
c61350	and all the hills shall melt.
c61351	And I will bring again the captivity of my people of Israel,
c61352	and they shall build the waste cities,
c61353	and inhabit
c61354	<i>them;</i> and they shall plant vineyards,
c61355	and drink the wine
c61356	thereof; they shall also make gardens,
c61357	and eat the fruit of them.
c61358	And I will plant them upon their land,
c61359	and they shall no more be pulled up out of their land
c61360	which I have given
c61361	them, saith the LORD thy God.
c61362	The vision of Obadiah.
c61363	Thus saith the Lord GOD concerning Edom; We have heard a rumour from the LORD,
c61365	and an ambassador is sent among the heathen,
c61366	Arise
c61367	ye, and let us rise up against her in battle.
c61368	Behold, I have made thee small among the heathen:
c61369	thou art greatly despised.
c61370	The pride of thine heart hath deceived
c61371	thee, thou that dwellest in the clefts of the rock,
c61372	whose habitation <i>is</i> high;
c61373	that saith in his heart,
c61374	Who shall bring me down to the ground?
c61375	Though thou exalt <i>thyself</i> as the eagle,
c61376	and though thou set thy nest among the stars,
c61377	thence will I bring thee down,
c61378	saith the LORD.
c61379	If thieves came
c61380	to thee, if robbers by night,
c61381	(how art thou cut off!)
c61382	would they not have stolen till they had enough?
c61383	if the grapegatherers came
c61384	to thee, would they not leave <i>some</i> grapes?
c61385	How are <i>the things</i> of Esau searched out!
c61386	<i>how</i> are his hidden things sought up!
c61387	All the men of thy confederacy have brought thee <i>even</i> to the border:
c61389	the men that were at peace with thee have deceived thee, <i>and</i> prevailed
c61390	against thee; <i>they that eat</i> thy bread have laid a wound under
c61391	thee: <i>there is</i> none understanding in him.
c61392	Shall I not in that day,
c61393	saith the LORD,
c61394	even destroy the wise <i>men</i> out of Edom,
c61395	and understanding out of the mount of Esau?
c61396	And thy mighty <i>men,</i> O Teman, shall be dismayed,
c61398	to the end that every one of the mount of Esau may be cut off by slaughter.
c61399	For <i>thy</i> violence against thy brother Jacob shame shall cover
c61400	thee, and thou shalt be cut off for ever.
c61401	In the day
c61402	that thou stoodest on the other side,
c61403	in the day
c61404	that the strangers carried away captive his forces,
c61405	and foreigners entered into his gates,
c61406	and cast lots upon Jerusalem,
c61407	even thou <i>wast</i> as one of them.
c61408	But thou shouldest not have looked on the day of thy brother in the day that he became a stranger;
c61409	neither shouldest thou have rejoiced over the children of Judah in the day
c61410	of their destruction;
c61411	neither shouldest thou have spoken proudly in the day of distress.
c61412	Thou shouldest not have entered into the gate of my people in the day of their calamity;
c61413	yea, thou shouldest not have looked on their affliction in the day of their calamity,
c61414	nor have laid <i>hands</i> on their substance in the day of their calamity;
c61415	Neither shouldest thou have stood in the crossway,
c61416	to cut off those of his that did escape;
c61417	neither shouldest thou have delivered up those of his that did remain in the day of distress.
c61418	For the day of the LORD <i>is</i> near upon all the heathen:
c61419	as thou hast done,
c61420	it shall be done
c61421	unto thee: thy reward shall return upon thine own head.
c61422	For
c61423	as ye have drunk upon my holy mountain,
c61424	<i>so</i> shall all the heathen drink continually,
c61425	yea, they shall drink,
c61426	and they shall swallow down,
c61427	and they shall be
c61428	as though they had not been.
c61429	But upon mount Zion shall be deliverance,
c61430	and there shall be holiness;
c61431	and the house of Jacob shall possess their possessions.
c61432	And the house of Jacob shall be a fire,
c61433	and the house of Joseph a flame,
c61434	and the house of Esau for stubble,
c61435	and they shall kindle
c61436	in them, and devour
c61437	them; and there shall not be <i>any</i> remaining of the house of Esau;
c61438	for the LORD hath spoken <i>it.</i>
c61439	And <i>they of</i> the south shall possess the mount of Esau;
c61440	and <i>they of</i> the plain the Philistines:
c61441	and they shall possess the fields of Ephraim, and the fields of Samaria:
c61442	and Benjamin <i>shall possess</i> Gilead.
c61443	And the captivity of this host of the children of Israel
c61444	<i>shall possess</i> that of the Canaanites,
c61445	<i>even</i> unto Zarephath;
c61446	and the captivity of Jerusalem,
c61447	which <i>is</i> in Sepharad,
c61448	shall possess the cities of the south.
c61449	And saviours shall come up on mount Zion
c61450	to judge the mount of Esau;
c61451	and the kingdom shall be the LORD'S.
c61452	Now the word of the LORD came unto Jonah the son of Amittai,
c61453	saying,
c61454	Arise,
c61455	go to Nineveh, that great city,
c61456	and cry against
c61457	it; for their wickedness is come up before me.
c61458	But Jonah rose up
c61459	to flee unto Tarshish from the presence of the LORD,
c61460	and went down to Joppa;
c61461	and he found a ship
c61462	going to Tarshish:
c61463	so he paid the fare
c61464	thereof, and went down
c61465	into it, to go with them unto Tarshish from the presence of the LORD.
c61466	But the LORD sent out a great wind into the sea,
c61467	and there was a mighty tempest in the sea,
c61468	so that the ship was like
c61469	to be broken.
c61470	Then the mariners were afraid,
c61471	and cried
c61472	every man unto his god,
c61473	and cast forth the wares
c61474	that <i>were</i> in the ship
c61475	into the sea,
c61476	to lighten <i>it</i> of
c61477	them. But Jonah was gone down into the sides of the ship;
c61478	and he lay,
c61479	and was fast asleep.
c61480	So the shipmaster came to
c61481	him, and said
c61482	unto him, What
c61483	meanest thou, O sleeper?
c61484	arise,
c61485	call upon thy God,
c61486	if so be that God will think
c61487	upon us, that we perish not.
c61488	And they said
c61489	every one to his fellow,
c61490	Come,
c61491	and let us cast lots,
c61492	that we may know
c61493	for whose cause this evil
c61494	<i>is</i> upon us. So they cast lots,
c61495	and the lot fell upon Jonah.
c61496	Then said they unto
c61497	him, Tell us, we pray thee,
c61498	for whose cause this evil
c61499	<i>is</i> upon us; What <i>is</i> thine occupation?
c61500	and whence comest
c61501	thou? what <i>is</i> thy country?
c61502	and of what people <i>art</i> thou?
c61503	And he said unto
c61504	them, I <i>am</i> an Hebrew;
c61505	and I fear the LORD, the God of heaven,
c61506	which hath made the sea and the dry <i>land.</i>
c61507	Then were the men exceedingly afraid,
c61508	and said unto
c61509	him, Why hast thou done this?
c61510	For the men knew
c61511	that he fled from the presence of the LORD,
c61512	because he had told them.
c61513	Then said they unto
c61514	him, What shall we do
c61515	unto thee, that the sea may be calm unto
c61516	us? for the sea wrought,
c61517	and was tempestuous.
c61518	And he said unto
c61519	them, Take me up,
c61520	and cast me forth into the sea;
c61521	so shall the sea be calm unto
c61522	you: for I know
c61523	that for my sake this great tempest <i>is</i> upon you.
c61524	Nevertheless the men rowed
c61525	hard to bring <i>it</i> to the land;
c61526	but they could not:
c61527	for the sea wrought,
c61528	and was tempestuous against them.
c61529	Wherefore they cried unto the LORD,
c61530	and said,
c61532	We beseech thee, O LORD, we beseech thee, let us not perish for this man's life,
c61533	and lay not upon us innocent blood:
c61534	for thou,
c61535	O LORD,
c61536	as it pleased thee.
c61537	hast done
c61538	So they took up Jonah,
c61539	and cast him forth into the sea:
c61540	and the sea ceased from her raging.
c61541	Then the men feared the LORD exceedingly,
c61542	and offered a sacrifice unto the LORD,
c61543	and made vows.
c61544	Now the LORD had prepared a great fish
c61545	to swallow up Jonah.
c61546	And Jonah was in the belly of the fish three days and three nights.
c61547	Then Jonah prayed unto the LORD his God out of the fish's belly,
c61548	And said,
c61549	I cried by reason of mine affliction unto the LORD,
c61550	and he heard
c61551	me; out of the belly of hell cried
c61552	I, <i>and</i> thou heardest my voice.
c61553	For thou hadst cast me into the deep, in the midst of the seas;
c61554	and the floods compassed me about:
c61555	all thy billows and thy waves passed over me.
c61556	Then I said,
c61557	I am cast out of thy sight;
c61558	yet I will look again
c61559	toward thy holy temple.
c61560	The waters compassed me about, <i>even</i> to the soul:
c61561	the depth closed me round about,
c61562	the weeds were wrapped about my head.
c61563	I went down to the bottoms of the mountains;
c61564	the earth
c61565	with her bars <i>was</i> about me for ever:
c61566	yet hast thou brought up my life from corruption,
c61567	O LORD my God.
c61568	When my soul fainted within
c61569	me I remembered the LORD:
c61570	and my prayer came in unto thee, into thine holy temple.
c61571	They that observe lying vanities
c61572	forsake their own mercy.
c61573	But I
c61574	will sacrifice unto thee with the voice of thanksgiving;
c61575	<i>that</i> that I have vowed.
c61576	I will pay
c61577	Salvation <i>is</i> of the LORD.
c61578	And the LORD spake unto the fish,
c61579	and it vomited out Jonah upon the dry <i>land.</i>
c61580	And the word of the LORD came unto Jonah the second time,
c61581	saying,
c61582	Arise,
c61583	go unto Nineveh, that great city,
c61584	and preach unto it the preaching
c61585	that I bid thee.
c61586	So Jonah arose,
c61587	and went unto Nineveh, according to the word of the LORD.
c61588	Now Nineveh was an exceeding great city
c61589	of three days' journey.
c61590	And Jonah began
c61591	to enter into the city a day's journey,
c61592	and he cried,
c61593	and said,
c61594	Yet forty days,
c61595	and Nineveh shall be overthrown.
c61596	So the people of Nineveh believed God,
c61597	and proclaimed a fast,
c61598	and put on sackcloth, from the greatest of them even to the least of them.
c61599	For word came unto the king of Nineveh,
c61600	and he arose from his throne,
c61601	and he laid his robe from
c61602	him, and covered <i>him</i> with sackcloth,
c61603	and sat in ashes.
c61604	And he caused <i>it</i> to be proclaimed
c61605	and published
c61606	through Nineveh by the decree of the king and his nobles,
c61607	saying,
c61608	Let neither man nor beast, herd nor flock, taste any thing:
c61609	let them not feed,
c61610	nor drink water:
c61611	But let man and beast be covered with sackcloth,
c61612	and cry mightily unto God:
c61613	yea, let them turn
c61614	every one from his evil way, and from the violence
c61615	that <i>is</i> in their hands.
c61616	Who can tell
c61618	<i>if</i> God will turn and repent,
c61619	and turn away from his fierce anger,
c61620	that we perish not?
c61621	And God saw their works,
c61622	that they turned from their evil way;
c61623	and God repented of the evil,
c61624	that he had said
c61625	that he would do
c61626	unto them; and he did <i>it</i> not.
c61627	But it displeased Jonah exceedingly,
c61628	and he was very angry.
c61629	And he prayed unto the LORD,
c61630	and said,
c61631	I pray thee, O LORD,
c61632	<i>was</i> not this my saying,
c61633	when I was yet in my country?
c61634	Therefore I fled before
c61635	unto Tarshish:
c61636	for I knew
c61637	that thou <i>art</i> a gracious God, and merciful,
c61638	slow to anger,
c61639	and of great kindness,
c61640	and repentest thee of the evil.
c61641	Therefore now, O LORD,
c61642	take, I beseech thee, my life from
c61643	me; for <i>it is</i> better for me to die than to live.
c61644	Then said the LORD,
c61645	Doest thou well
c61646	to be angry?
c61647	So Jonah went out of the city,
c61648	and sat on the east side of the city,
c61649	and there made him a booth,
c61650	and sat under it in the shadow,
c61651	till he might see
c61652	what would become of the city.
c61653	And the LORD God prepared a gourd,
c61654	and made <i>it</i> to come up over Jonah,
c61655	that it might be a shadow over his head,
c61656	to deliver him from his grief.
c61657	So Jonah was exceeding glad of the gourd.
c61658	But God prepared a worm
c61659	when the morning rose the next day,
c61660	and it smote the gourd
c61661	that it withered.
c61662	And it came to pass,
c61663	when the sun did arise,
c61664	that God prepared a vehement east wind;
c61665	and the sun beat upon the head of Jonah,
c61666	that he fainted,
c61667	and wished in himself
c61668	to die,
c61669	and said,
c61670	<i>It is</i> better for me to die than to live.
c61671	And God said to Jonah,
c61672	Doest thou well
c61673	to be angry for the gourd?
c61674	And he said,
c61675	I do well
c61676	to be angry, <i>even</i> unto death.
c61677	Then said the LORD,
c61678	Thou hast had pity on the gourd,
c61679	for the which thou hast not laboured,
c61680	neither madest it grow;
c61681	which came up in a night, and perished in
c61682	a night:
c61684	And should not I spare Nineveh, that great city,
c61685	wherein are
c61686	more than sixscore thousand persons
c61687	that cannot discern between their right hand and their left hand;
c61688	and <i>also</i> much cattle?
c61689	The word of the LORD
c61690	that came to Micah the Morasthite in the days of Jotham, Ahaz, <i>and</i> Hezekiah, kings of Judah,
c61691	which he saw concerning Samaria and Jerusalem.
c61692	Hear,
c61693	all ye people;
c61694	hearken,
c61695	O earth, and all that therein is:
c61696	and let the Lord GOD be witness
c61697	against you, the Lord from his holy temple.
c61698	For, behold, the LORD cometh forth out of his place,
c61699	and will come down,
c61700	and tread upon the high places of the earth.
c61701	And the mountains shall be molten under
c61702	him, and the valleys shall be cleft,
c61703	as wax before the fire,
c61704	<i>and</i> as the waters <i>that are</i> poured down a steep place.
c61705	For the transgression of Jacob <i>is</i> all this,
c61706	and for the sins of the house of Israel.
c61707	What <i>is</i> the transgression of Jacob?
c61708	<i>is it</i> not Samaria?
c61709	and what <i>are</i> the high places of Judah?
c61710	<i>are they</i> not Jerusalem?
c61711	Therefore I will make Samaria as an heap of the field, <i>and</i> as plantings of a vineyard:
c61712	and I will pour down the stones thereof into the valley,
c61713	and I will discover the foundations thereof.
c61714	And all the graven images thereof shall be beaten to pieces,
c61715	and all the hires thereof shall be burned with the fire,
c61716	and all the idols thereof will I lay desolate:
c61717	for she gathered <i>it</i> of the hire of an harlot,
c61718	and they shall return to the hire of an harlot.
c61719	Therefore I will wail
c61720	and howl,
c61721	I will go stripped and naked:
c61722	I will make a wailing like the dragons,
c61723	and mourning as the owls.
c61724	For her wound <i>is</i> incurable;
c61725	for it is come unto Judah;
c61726	he is come unto the gate of my people, <i>even</i> to Jerusalem.
c61727	Declare ye <i>it</i> not at Gath,
c61728	weep ye not at all:
c61729	in the house of Aphrah roll thyself in the dust.
c61730	Pass ye away,
c61731	thou inhabitant of Saphir,
c61732	having thy shame naked:
c61733	the inhabitant of Zaanan came not forth
c61734	in the mourning of Bethezel;
c61735	he shall receive of you his standing.
c61736	For the inhabitant of Maroth waited carefully for good:
c61737	but evil came down from the LORD unto the gate of Jerusalem.
c61738	bind the chariot to the swift beast:
c61739	O thou inhabitant of Lachish,
c61740	she <i>is</i> the beginning of the sin to the daughter of Zion:
c61741	for the transgressions of Israel were found in thee.
c61742	Therefore shalt thou give presents to Moreshethgath:
c61743	the houses of Achzib <i>shall be</i> a lie to the kings of Israel.
c61744	Yet will I bring an heir
c61745	unto thee, O inhabitant of Mareshah:
c61746	he shall come unto Adullam the glory of Israel.
c61747	Make thee bald,
c61748	and poll thee for thy delicate children;
c61749	enlarge thy baldness as the eagle;
c61750	for they are gone into captivity from thee.
c61751	Woe
c61752	to them that devise iniquity,
c61753	and work evil upon their beds!
c61754	when the morning is light, they practise
c61755	it, because it is in the power of their hand.
c61756	And they covet fields,
c61757	and take <i>them</i> by violence;
c61758	and houses,
c61759	and take <i>them</i> away:
c61760	so they oppress a man and his house, even a man and his heritage.
c61761	Therefore
c61762	thus saith the LORD;
c61763	Behold, against this family do I devise an evil,
c61764	from which ye shall not remove your necks;
c61765	neither shall ye go haughtily:
c61766	for this time <i>is</i> evil.
c61767	In that day shall <i>one</i> take up a parable against
c61768	you, and lament with a doleful lamentation,
c61769	We be
c61770	<i>and</i> say,
c61771	utterly spoiled:
c61772	he hath changed the portion of my people:
c61773	how hath he removed
c61774	<i>it</i> from me! turning away he hath divided our fields.
c61775	Therefore
c61776	thou shalt have none
c61777	that shall cast a cord by lot
c61778	in the congregation of the LORD.
c61779	Prophesy ye not,
c61780	<i>say they to them that</i> prophesy:
c61781	they shall not prophesy to them,
c61782	<i>that</i> they shall not take shame.
c61783	O <i>thou that art</i> named
c61784	the house of Jacob,
c61785	is the spirit of the LORD straitened?
c61786	<i>are</i> these his doings?
c61787	do not my words do good
c61788	to him that walketh uprightly?
c61789	Even of late my people is risen up as an enemy:
c61790	ye pull off the robe with the garment
c61791	from them that pass by securely as men averse from war.
c61792	The women of my people have ye cast out from their pleasant houses;
c61793	from their children have ye taken away my glory for ever.
c61794	Arise
c61795	ye, and depart;
c61796	for this <i>is</i> not <i>your</i> rest:
c61797	because it is polluted,
c61798	it shall destroy
c61799	<i>you,</i> even with a sore destruction.
c61800	If a man walking
c61801	in the spirit and falsehood do lie,
c61802	<i>saying,</i> I will prophesy unto thee of wine and of strong drink;
c61803	he shall even be the prophet of this people.
c61804	I will surely assemble,
c61805	O Jacob,
c61806	all
c61807	of thee; I will surely gather the remnant of Israel;
c61808	I will put them together as the sheep of Bozrah,
c61809	as the flock in the midst of their fold:
c61810	they shall make great noise by reason of <i>the multitude of</i> men.
c61811	The breaker is come up before
c61812	them: they have broken up,
c61813	and have passed through the gate,
c61814	and are gone out
c61815	by it: and their king shall pass before
c61816	them, and the LORD on the head of them.
c61817	And I said,
c61818	Hear, I pray you,
c61819	O heads of Jacob, and ye princes of the house of Israel;
c61820	<i>Is it</i> not
c61821	for you to know judgment?
c61822	Who hate the good,
c61823	and love the evil;
c61824	who pluck off their skin from off
c61825	them, and their flesh from off their bones;
c61826	Who also eat the flesh of my people,
c61827	and flay their skin from off
c61828	them; and they break their bones,
c61829	and chop them in pieces,
c61830	as for the pot,
c61831	and as flesh within the caldron.
c61832	Then shall they cry unto the LORD,
c61833	but he will not hear
c61834	them: he will even hide his face from them at that time,
c61835	as they have behaved themselves ill in their doings.
c61836	Thus saith the LORD concerning the prophets
c61837	that make my people err,
c61838	that bite with their teeth,
c61839	and cry, Peace;
c61840	and he that putteth not into their mouths,
c61841	they even prepare war against him.
c61842	Therefore
c61843	night <i>shall be</i> unto you, that ye shall not have a vision;
c61844	and it shall be dark
c61845	unto you, that ye shall not divine;
c61846	and the sun shall go down over the prophets,
c61847	and the day shall be dark over them.
c61848	Then shall the seers be ashamed,
c61849	and the diviners confounded:
c61850	yea, they shall all cover their lips;
c61851	for <i>there is</i> no answer of God.
c61852	But truly I am full of power by the spirit of the LORD, and of judgment, and of might,
c61853	to declare unto Jacob his transgression,
c61854	and to Israel his sin.
c61855	Hear this, I pray you,
c61856	ye heads of the house of Jacob, and princes of the house of Israel,
c61857	that abhor judgment,
c61858	and pervert all equity.
c61859	They build up Zion with blood,
c61860	and Jerusalem with iniquity.
c61861	The heads thereof judge for reward,
c61862	and the priests thereof teach for hire,
c61863	and the prophets thereof divine for money:
c61864	yet will they lean upon the LORD,
c61865	and say,
c61866	<i>Is</i> not the LORD among
c61867	us? none evil can come upon us.
c61868	Therefore
c61869	shall Zion for your sake be plowed <i>as</i> a field,
c61870	and Jerusalem shall become heaps,
c61871	and the mountain of the house as the high places of the forest.
c61872	But in the last days it shall come to pass,
c61873	<i>that</i> the mountain of the house of the LORD shall be established in the top of the mountains,
c61874	and it shall be exalted above the hills;
c61875	and people shall flow unto it.
c61876	And many nations shall come,
c61877	and say,
c61878	Come,
c61879	and let us go up to the mountain of the LORD, and to the house of the God of Jacob;
c61880	and he will teach us of his ways,
c61881	and we will walk in his paths:
c61882	for the law shall go forth of Zion,
c61883	and the word of the LORD from Jerusalem.
c61884	And he shall judge among many people,
c61885	and rebuke strong nations afar off;
c61886	and they shall beat their swords into plowshares,
c61887	and their spears into pruninghooks:
c61888	nation shall not lift up a sword against nation,
c61889	neither shall they learn war any more.
c61890	But they shall sit
c61891	every man under his vine and under his fig tree;
c61892	and none shall make <i>them</i> afraid:
c61893	for the mouth of the LORD of hosts hath spoken <i>it.</i>
c61894	For all people will walk
c61895	every one in the name of his god,
c61896	and we will walk in the name of the LORD our God for ever and ever.
c61897	In that day,
c61898	saith the LORD,
c61899	will I assemble her that halteth,
c61900	and I will gather her that is driven out,
c61902	and her that I have afflicted;
c61903	And I will make her that halted a remnant,
c61904	and her that was cast far off a strong nation:
c61905	and the LORD shall reign over them in mount Zion from henceforth, even for ever.
c61906	And thou,
c61907	O tower of the flock,
c61908	the strong hold of the daughter of Zion,
c61909	unto thee shall it come,
c61910	even the first dominion; the kingdom shall come
c61911	to the daughter of Jerusalem.
c61912	Now
c61913	why dost thou cry out aloud?
c61914	<i>is there</i> no king
c61915	in thee? is thy counsellor perished?
c61916	for pangs have taken thee as a woman in travail.
c61917	Be in pain,
c61918	and labour to bring forth,
c61919	O daughter of Zion,
c61920	like a woman in travail:
c61921	for now shalt thou go forth out of the city,
c61922	and thou shalt dwell in the field,
c61923	and thou shalt go <i>even</i> to Babylon;
c61924	there shalt thou be delivered;
c61925	there the LORD shall redeem thee from the hand of thine enemies.
c61926	Now also many nations are gathered against
c61927	thee, that say,
c61928	Let her be defiled,
c61929	and let our eye look upon Zion.
c61930	But they know not the thoughts of the LORD,
c61931	neither understand they his counsel:
c61932	for he shall gather them as the sheaves into the floor.
c61933	Arise
c61934	and thresh,
c61935	O daughter of Zion:
c61936	for I will make thine horn iron,
c61937	and I will make thy hoofs brass:
c61938	and thou shalt beat in pieces many people:
c61939	and I will consecrate their gain unto the LORD,
c61940	and their substance unto the Lord of the whole earth.
c61941	Now gather thyself in troops,
c61942	O daughter of troops:
c61943	he hath laid siege against
c61944	us: they shall smite the judge of Israel with a rod upon the cheek.
c61945	But thou,
c61946	Bethlehem Ephratah,
c61948	<i>though</i> thou be little among the thousands of Judah,
c61949	<i>yet</i> out of thee shall he come forth
c61950	unto me <i>that is</i> to be ruler in Israel;
c61951	whose goings forth <i>have been</i> from of old, from everlasting.
c61952	Therefore
c61953	will he give them up, until the time
c61954	<i>that</i> she which travaileth hath brought forth:
c61955	then the remnant of his brethren shall return unto the children of Israel.
c61956	And he shall stand
c61957	and feed in the strength of the LORD, in the majesty of the name of the LORD his God;
c61958	and they shall abide:
c61959	for now shall he be great unto the ends of the earth.
c61960	And this <i>man</i> shall be the peace,
c61962	when the Assyrian shall come into our land:
c61963	and when he shall tread in our palaces,
c61964	then shall we raise against him seven shepherds, and eight principal men.
c61965	And they shall waste the land of Assyria with the sword,
c61966	and the land of Nimrod in the entrances
c61967	thereof: thus shall he deliver <i>us</i> from the Assyrian,
c61968	when he cometh into our land,
c61969	and when he treadeth within our borders.
c61970	And the remnant of Jacob shall be in the midst of many people
c61971	as a dew from the LORD,
c61972	as the showers upon the grass,
c61973	that tarrieth not for man,
c61974	nor waiteth for the sons of men.
c61975	And the remnant of Jacob shall be among the Gentiles in the midst of many people
c61976	as a lion among the beasts of the forest,
c61977	as a young lion among the flocks of sheep:
c61978	who,
c61979	if he go through,
c61980	both treadeth down,
c61981	and teareth in pieces,
c61982	and none can deliver.
c61983	Thine hand shall be lifted up upon thine adversaries,
c61984	and all thine enemies shall be cut off.
c61985	And it shall come to pass in that day,
c61986	saith the LORD,
c61987	that I will cut off thy horses out of the midst
c61988	of thee, and I will destroy thy chariots:
c61989	And I will cut off the cities of thy land,
c61990	and throw down all thy strong holds:
c61991	And I will cut off witchcrafts out of thine hand;
c61992	and thou shalt have no <i>more</i> soothsayers:
c61993	Thy graven images also will I cut off, and thy standing images out of the midst
c61994	of thee; and thou shalt no more worship the work of thine hands.
c61995	And I will pluck up thy groves out of the midst
c61996	of thee: so will I destroy thy cities.
c61997	And I will execute vengeance in anger and fury upon the heathen,
c61998	such as they have not heard.
c61999	Hear ye now
c62000	what the LORD saith;
c62001	Arise,
c62002	contend thou before the mountains,
c62003	and let the hills hear thy voice.
c62004	Hear
c62005	ye, O mountains,
c62006	the LORD'S controversy,
c62007	and ye strong foundations of the earth:
c62008	for the LORD hath a controversy with his people,
c62009	and he will plead with Israel.
c62010	O my people,
c62011	what have I done
c62012	unto thee? and wherein have I wearied
c62013	thee? testify against me.
c62014	For I brought thee up out of the land of Egypt,
c62015	and redeemed thee out of the house of servants;
c62016	and I sent before thee Moses, Aaron, and Miriam.
c62017	O my people,
c62018	remember now
c62019	what Balak king of Moab consulted,
c62020	and what Balaam the son of Beor answered
c62021	him from Shittim unto Gilgal;
c62022	that ye may know the righteousness of the LORD.
c62023	Wherewith shall I come before the LORD,
c62024	<i>and</i> bow myself before the high God?
c62025	shall I come before him with burnt offerings, with calves of a year old?
c62026	Will the LORD be pleased with thousands of rams, <i>or</i> with ten thousands of rivers of oil?
c62027	shall I give my firstborn <i>for</i> my transgression,
c62028	the fruit of my body <i>for</i> the sin of my soul?
c62029	He hath shewed
c62030	thee, O man,
c62031	what <i>is</i> good;
c62032	and what doth the LORD require of
c62033	thee, but to do justly,
c62034	and to love mercy,
c62035	and to walk humbly with thy God?
c62036	The LORD'S voice crieth unto the city,
c62037	and <i>the man of</i> wisdom shall see thy name:
c62038	hear ye the rod,
c62039	and who hath appointed it.
c62041	Are there yet the treasures of wickedness in the house of the wicked, and the scant measure
c62042	<i>that is</i> abominable?
c62043	Shall I count <i>them</i> pure with the wicked balances, and with the bag of deceitful weights?
c62044	For the rich men thereof are full of violence,
c62045	and the inhabitants thereof have spoken lies,
c62046	and their tongue <i>is</i> deceitful in their mouth.
c62047	Therefore also will I make <i>thee</i> sick
c62048	in smiting
c62049	thee, in making <i>thee</i> desolate because of thy sins.
c62050	Thou shalt eat,
c62051	but not be satisfied;
c62052	and thy casting down <i>shall be</i> in the midst
c62053	of thee; and thou shalt take hold,
c62054	but shalt not deliver;
c62056	and <i>that</i> which thou deliverest
c62057	will I give up to the sword.
c62058	Thou shalt sow,
c62059	but thou shalt not reap;
c62060	thou shalt tread the olives,
c62061	but thou shalt not anoint thee with oil;
c62062	and sweet wine,
c62063	but shalt not drink wine.
c62064	For the statutes of Omri are kept, and all the works of the house of Ahab,
c62065	and ye walk in their counsels;
c62066	that I should make thee a desolation,
c62067	and the inhabitants thereof an hissing:
c62068	therefore ye shall bear the reproach of my people.
c62069	Woe
c62070	is me! for I am as when they have gathered the summer fruits, as the grapegleanings of the vintage:
c62071	<i>there is</i> no cluster
c62072	to eat:
c62073	the firstripe fruit.
c62074	my soul desired
c62075	The good <i>man</i> is perished out of the earth:
c62076	and <i>there is</i> none upright among men:
c62077	they all lie in wait for blood;
c62079	they hunt every man his brother with a net.
c62080	That they may do evil with both hands
c62081	earnestly,
c62082	the prince asketh,
c62083	and the judge <i>asketh</i> for a reward;
c62084	and the great
c62085	<i>man,</i> he uttereth his mischievous desire:
c62086	so they wrap it up.
c62087	The best of them <i>is</i> as a brier:
c62088	the most upright <i>is sharper</i> than a thorn hedge:
c62089	the day of thy watchmen <i>and</i> thy visitation cometh;
c62090	now shall be their perplexity.
c62091	Trust ye not in a friend,
c62092	put ye not confidence in a guide:
c62093	keep the doors of thy mouth from her that lieth in thy bosom.
c62094	For the son dishonoureth the father,
c62095	the daughter riseth up against her mother,
c62096	the daughter in law against her mother in law;
c62097	a man's enemies <i>are</i> the men of his own house.
c62098	Therefore I will look unto the LORD;
c62099	I will wait for the God of my salvation:
c62100	my God will hear me.
c62101	Rejoice not
c62102	against me, O mine enemy:
c62104	when I fall,
c62105	I shall arise;
c62106	when I sit in darkness,
c62107	the LORD <i>shall be</i> a light unto me.
c62108	I will bear the indignation of the LORD,
c62109	because I have sinned
c62110	against him, until he plead my cause,
c62111	and execute judgment
c62112	for me: he will bring me forth to the light,
c62113	<i>and</i> I shall behold his righteousness.
c62114	Then <i>she that is</i> mine enemy shall see
c62115	<i>it,</i> and shame shall cover
c62116	her which said unto
c62117	me, Where is the LORD thy God?
c62118	mine eyes shall behold
c62119	her: now shall she be trodden down
c62120	as the mire of the streets.
c62121	<i>In</i> the day
c62122	that thy walls are to be built,
c62123	<i>in</i> that day shall the decree be far removed.
c62124	<i>In</i> that day
c62125	<i>also</i> he shall come even to
c62126	thee from Assyria, and <i>from</i> the fortified cities, and from the fortress
c62127	even to the river,
c62128	and from sea to sea,
c62129	and <i>from</i> mountain to mountain.
c62130	Notwithstanding the land shall be desolate because of them that dwell therein, for the fruit of their doings.
c62131	Feed thy people with thy rod, the flock of thine heritage,
c62132	which dwell solitarily <i>in</i> the wood, in the midst of Carmel:
c62133	let them feed <i>in</i> Bashan and Gilead, as in the days of old.
c62134	According to the days
c62135	of thy coming out of the land of Egypt
c62136	will I shew unto him marvellous <i>things.</i>
c62137	The nations shall see
c62138	and be confounded at all their might:
c62139	they shall lay <i>their</i> hand upon <i>their</i> mouth,
c62140	their ears shall be deaf.
c62141	They shall lick the dust like a serpent, they shall move out of their holes like worms of the earth:
c62143	they shall be afraid of the LORD our God,
c62144	and shall fear because of thee.
c62145	Who <i>is</i> a God like unto thee,
c62146	that pardoneth iniquity,
c62147	and passeth by the transgression of the remnant of his heritage?
c62148	he retaineth not his anger for ever,
c62149	because he delighteth <i>in</i> mercy.
c62150	He will turn again,
c62151	he will have compassion
c62152	upon us; he will subdue our iniquities;
c62153	and thou wilt cast all their sins into the depths of the sea.
c62154	Thou wilt perform the truth to Jacob,
c62155	<i>and</i> the mercy to Abraham,
c62156	which thou hast sworn unto our fathers from the days of old.
c62157	The burden of Nineveh.
c62158	The book of the vision of Nahum the Elkoshite.
c62159	God <i>is</i> jealous, and the LORD revengeth;
c62160	the LORD revengeth,
c62161	and <i>is</i> furious;
c62162	the LORD will take vengeance on his adversaries,
c62163	and he reserveth <i>wrath</i> for his enemies.
c62164	The LORD <i>is</i> slow to anger, and great in power,
c62165	and will not at all acquit
c62166	<i>the wicked:</i> the LORD
c62167	hath his way in the whirlwind and in the storm,
c62168	and the clouds <i>are</i> the dust of his feet.
c62169	He rebuketh the sea,
c62170	and maketh it dry,
c62171	and drieth up all the rivers:
c62172	Bashan languisheth, and Carmel,
c62173	and the flower of Lebanon languisheth.
c62174	The mountains quake at
c62175	him, and the hills melt,
c62176	and the earth is burned at his presence,
c62177	yea, the world, and all
c62178	that dwell therein.
c62179	before his indignation?
c62180	Who can stand
c62181	and who can abide in the fierceness of his anger?
c62182	his fury is poured out like fire,
c62183	and the rocks are thrown down by him.
c62184	The LORD <i>is</i> good,
c62185	a strong hold in the day of trouble;
c62186	and he knoweth
c62187	them that trust in him.
c62188	But with an overrunning flood he will make an utter end of the place
c62189	thereof, and darkness shall pursue his enemies.
c62190	What do ye imagine against the LORD?
c62191	he will make an utter end:
c62192	affliction shall not rise up the second time.
c62193	For
c62194	while <i>they be</i> folden together <i>as</i> thorns,
c62195	and while they are drunken <i>as</i> drunkards,
c62196	they shall be devoured as stubble fully dry.
c62197	There is <i>one</i> come out of
c62198	thee, that imagineth evil against the LORD,
c62199	a wicked counsellor.
c62200	Thus saith the LORD;
c62201	Though <i>they be</i> quiet,
c62202	and likewise many,
c62203	yet thus shall they be cut down,
c62204	when he shall pass through.
c62205	Though I have afflicted
c62206	thee, I will afflict thee no more.
c62207	For now
c62208	will I break his yoke from off
c62209	thee, and will burst thy bonds in sunder.
c62210	And the LORD hath given a commandment concerning
c62211	thee, <i>that</i> no more of thy name be sown:
c62212	out of the house of thy gods will I cut off the graven image and the molten image:
c62213	I will make thy grave;
c62214	for thou art vile.
c62215	Behold upon the mountains the feet of him that bringeth good tidings,
c62216	that publisheth peace!
c62217	keep
c62218	O Judah,
c62219	thy solemn feasts,
c62220	perform thy vows:
c62221	for the wicked shall no more
c62222	pass through
c62224	thee; he is utterly cut off.
c62225	He that dasheth in pieces is come up before thy face:
c62226	keep the munition,
c62227	watch the way,
c62228	make <i>thy</i> loins strong,
c62229	fortify <i>thy</i> power mightily.
c62230	For the LORD hath turned away the excellency of Jacob, as the excellency of Israel:
c62231	for the emptiers have emptied
c62232	them out, and marred their vine branches.
c62233	The shield of his mighty men is made red,
c62234	the valiant men <i>are</i> in scarlet:
c62235	the chariots <i>shall be</i> with flaming torches in the day
c62236	of his preparation,
c62237	and the fir trees shall be terribly shaken.
c62238	The chariots shall rage in the streets,
c62239	they shall justle one against another in the broad ways:
c62240	they shall seem like torches,
c62241	they shall run like the lightnings.
c62242	He shall recount his worthies:
c62243	they shall stumble in their walk;
c62244	they shall make haste to the wall
c62245	thereof, and the defence shall be prepared.
c62246	The gates of the rivers shall be opened,
c62247	and the palace shall be dissolved.
c62248	And Huzzab
c62249	shall be led away captive,
c62250	she shall be brought up,
c62251	and her maids shall lead <i>her</i> as with the voice of doves,
c62252	tabering upon their breasts.
c62253	But Nineveh <i>is</i> of old like a pool of water:
c62254	yet they shall flee away.
c62255	Stand,
c62256	stand,
c62257	<i>shall they cry;</i> but none shall look back.
c62258	Take ye the spoil of silver,
c62259	take the spoil of gold:
c62260	for <i>there is</i> none end of the store
c62261	<i>and</i> glory out of all the pleasant furniture.
c62262	She is empty, and void, and waste:
c62263	and the heart melteth,
c62264	and the knees smite together,
c62265	and much pain <i>is</i> in all loins,
c62266	and the faces of them all gather blackness.
c62267	Where <i>is</i> the dwelling of the lions,
c62268	and the feedingplace
c62269	of the young lions,
c62270	where the lion, <i>even</i> the old lion, walked,
c62271	<i>and</i> the lion's whelp,
c62272	and none made <i>them</i> afraid?
c62273	The lion
c62274	did tear in pieces enough for his whelps,
c62275	and strangled for his lionesses,
c62276	and filled his holes with prey,
c62277	and his dens with ravin.
c62278	Behold, I <i>am</i> against
c62279	thee, saith the LORD of hosts,
c62280	and I will burn her chariots in the smoke,
c62281	and the sword shall devour thy young lions:
c62282	and I will cut off thy prey from the earth,
c62283	and the voice of thy messengers shall no more be heard.
c62284	Woe
c62285	to the bloody city!
c62286	it <i>is</i> all full of lies
c62287	<i>and</i> robbery;
c62288	the prey departeth not;
c62289	The noise of a whip,
c62290	and the noise of the rattling of the wheels,
c62291	and of the pransing horses,
c62292	and of the jumping chariots.
c62293	The horseman lifteth up
c62294	both the bright sword and the glittering spear: and <i>there is</i> a multitude of slain, and a great number of carcases;
c62295	and <i>there is</i> none end of <i>their</i> corpses;
c62296	they stumble upon their corpses:
c62297	Because of the multitude of the whoredoms of the wellfavoured harlot, the mistress of witchcrafts, that selleth nations through her whoredoms,
c62299	and families through her witchcrafts.
c62300	Behold, I <i>am</i> against
c62301	thee, saith the LORD of hosts;
c62302	and I will discover thy skirts upon thy face,
c62303	and I will shew the nations thy nakedness,
c62304	and the kingdoms thy shame.
c62305	And I will cast abominable filth upon
c62306	thee, and make thee vile,
c62307	and will set thee as a gazingstock.
c62308	And it shall come to pass,
c62309	<i>that</i> all they that look upon thee shall flee from
c62310	thee, and say,
c62311	Nineveh is laid waste:
c62312	who will bemoan
c62313	her? whence shall I seek comforters for thee?
c62314	Art thou better than populous No,
c62315	that was situate among the rivers,
c62316	<i>that had</i> the waters round about
c62317	it, whose rampart <i>was</i> the sea,
c62318	<i>and</i> her wall <i>was</i> from the sea?
c62319	Ethiopia and Egypt <i>were</i> her strength,
c62321	and <i>it was</i> infinite;
c62322	Put and Lubim were thy helpers.
c62323	Yet <i>was</i> she carried away, she went into captivity:
c62324	her young children also were dashed in pieces at the top of all the streets:
c62325	and they cast lots for her honourable men,
c62326	and all her great men were bound in chains.
c62327	Thou also shalt be drunken:
c62328	thou shalt be hid,
c62329	thou also shalt seek strength because of the enemy.
c62330	All thy strong holds <i>shall be like</i> fig trees with the firstripe figs:
c62331	if they be shaken,
c62332	they shall even fall into the mouth of the eater.
c62333	Behold, thy people in the midst of thee <i>are</i> women:
c62334	the gates of thy land shall be set wide open unto thine enemies:
c62335	the fire shall devour thy bars.
c62336	Draw thee waters for the siege,
c62337	fortify thy strong holds:
c62338	go into clay,
c62339	and tread the morter,
c62340	make strong the brickkiln.
c62341	There shall the fire devour
c62342	thee; the sword shall cut thee off,
c62343	it shall eat thee up like the cankerworm:
c62344	make thyself many as the cankerworm,
c62345	make thyself many as the locusts.
c62346	Thou hast multiplied thy merchants above the stars of heaven:
c62347	the cankerworm spoileth,
c62348	and flieth away.
c62349	Thy crowned <i>are</i> as the locusts,
c62350	and thy captains as the great grasshoppers,
c62351	which camp in the hedges in the cold day,
c62352	<i>but</i> when the sun ariseth
c62353	they flee away,
c62354	and their place is not known
c62355	where they <i>are.</i>
c62356	Thy shepherds slumber,
c62357	O king of Assyria:
c62358	thy nobles shall dwell
c62359	<i>in the dust:</i> thy people is scattered upon the mountains,
c62360	and no man gathereth <i>them.</i>
c62361	<i>There is</i> no healing of thy bruise;
c62362	thy wound is grievous:
c62363	all that hear the bruit of thee shall clap the hands over
c62364	thee: for upon whom hath not thy wickedness passed continually?
c62365	The burden
c62366	which Habakkuk the prophet did see.
c62367	how long
c62368	O LORD,
c62369	shall I cry,
c62370	and thou wilt not hear!
c62371	<i>even</i> cry out unto thee <i>of</i> violence,
c62372	and thou wilt not save!
c62373	Why dost thou shew me iniquity,
c62374	and cause <i>me</i> to behold grievance?
c62375	for spoiling and violence <i>are</i> before
c62376	me: and there are <i>that</i> raise up strife
c62377	and contention.
c62378	Therefore the law is slacked,
c62379	and judgment doth never go forth:
c62380	for the wicked doth compass about the righteous;
c62381	therefore wrong judgment proceedeth.
c62382	Behold ye among the heathen,
c62383	and regard,
c62384	and wonder marvellously:
c62386	for <i>I</i> will work a work in your days,
c62387	<i>which</i> ye will not believe,
c62388	though it be told <i>you.</i>
c62389	For, lo, I raise up the Chaldeans, <i>that</i> bitter and hasty nation,
c62390	which shall march through the breadth of the land,
c62391	to possess the dwellingplaces
c62392	<i>that are</i> not theirs.
c62393	They <i>are</i> terrible and dreadful:
c62394	their judgment and their dignity shall proceed of themselves.
c62395	Their horses also are swifter than the leopards,
c62396	and are more fierce than the evening wolves:
c62397	and their horsemen shall spread
c62398	themselves, and their horsemen shall come from far;
c62399	they shall fly as the eagle
c62400	<i>that</i> hasteth
c62401	to eat.
c62402	They shall come all for violence:
c62403	their faces shall sup up <i>as</i> the east wind,
c62404	and they shall gather the captivity as the sand.
c62405	And they
c62406	shall scoff at the kings,
c62407	and the princes shall be a scorn
c62408	unto them: they
c62409	shall deride every strong hold;
c62410	for they shall heap dust,
c62411	and take it.
c62412	Then shall <i>his</i> mind change,
c62413	and he shall pass over,
c62414	and offend,
c62415	<i>imputing</i> this his power unto his god.
c62416	<i>Art</i> thou not from everlasting,
c62417	O LORD my God, mine Holy One?
c62418	we shall not die.
c62419	O LORD,
c62420	thou hast ordained them for judgment;
c62421	and, O mighty God,
c62422	them for correction.
c62423	thou hast established
c62424	<i>Thou art</i> of purer eyes
c62425	than to behold evil,
c62427	look on iniquity:
c62428	and canst not
c62429	wherefore lookest thou upon them that deal treacherously,
c62430	<i>and</i> holdest thy tongue
c62431	when the wicked devoureth
c62432	<i>the man that is</i> more righteous than he?
c62433	And makest men as the fishes of the sea,
c62434	as the creeping things,
c62435	<i>that have</i> no ruler over them?
c62436	They take up all of them with the angle,
c62437	they catch them in their net,
c62438	and gather them in their drag:
c62439	therefore they rejoice
c62440	and are glad.
c62441	Therefore they sacrifice unto their net,
c62442	and burn incense unto their drag;
c62443	because by them their portion <i>is</i> fat,
c62444	and their meat plenteous.
c62445	Shall they therefore empty their net,
c62446	continually
c62447	to slay the nations?
c62448	and not spare
c62449	I will stand upon my watch,
c62450	and set me upon the tower,
c62451	and will watch
c62452	to see
c62453	what he will say
c62454	unto me, and what I shall answer when I am reproved.
c62455	And the LORD answered
c62456	me, and said,
c62457	Write the vision,
c62458	and make <i>it</i> plain upon tables,
c62459	that he may run
c62460	that readeth it.
c62461	For the vision <i>is</i> yet for an appointed time,
c62462	but at the end it shall speak,
c62463	and not lie:
c62464	though it tarry,
c62465	wait
c62466	for it; because it will surely come,
c62467	it will not tarry.
c62468	Behold, his soul <i>which</i> is lifted up
c62469	is not upright
c62470	in him: but the just shall live by his faith.
c62471	Yea
c62472	also, because he transgresseth by wine, <i>he is</i> a proud man,
c62473	neither keepeth at home,
c62474	who enlargeth his desire as hell,
c62475	and <i>is</i> as death,
c62476	and cannot be satisfied,
c62477	but gathereth unto him all nations,
c62478	and heapeth unto him all people:
c62479	Shall not all these take up a parable against
c62480	him, and a taunting proverb
c62481	against him, and say,
c62482	Woe
c62483	to him that increaseth
c62484	<i>that which is</i> not
c62485	his! how long?
c62486	and to him that ladeth himself with thick clay!
c62487	Shall they not rise up suddenly that shall bite
c62488	thee, and awake that shall vex
c62489	thee, and thou shalt be for booties unto them?
c62490	Because thou hast spoiled many nations,
c62491	all the remnant of the people shall spoil thee; because of men's blood, and <i>for</i> the violence of the land, of the city, and of all
c62492	that dwell therein.
c62493	Woe
c62494	to him that coveteth an evil covetousness to his house,
c62495	that he may set his nest on high,
c62496	that he may be delivered from the power of evil!
c62497	Thou hast consulted shame to thy house
c62498	by cutting off many people,
c62499	and hast sinned <i>against</i> thy soul.
c62500	For the stone shall cry out of the wall,
c62501	and the beam out of the timber shall answer it.
c62502	Woe
c62503	to him that buildeth a town with blood,
c62504	and stablisheth a city by iniquity!
c62506	Behold, <i>is it</i> not of the LORD of hosts
c62507	that the people shall labour in the very fire,
c62508	and the people shall weary themselves for very vanity?
c62509	For the earth shall be filled
c62510	with the knowledge of the glory of the LORD,
c62511	as the waters cover the sea.
c62512	Woe
c62513	unto him that giveth his neighbour drink,
c62514	that puttest thy bottle
c62515	to <i>him,</i> and makest <i>him</i> drunken also,
c62516	that thou mayest look on their nakedness!
c62517	Thou art filled with shame for glory:
c62518	drink thou also,
c62519	and let thy foreskin be uncovered:
c62520	the cup of the LORD'S right hand shall be turned unto
c62521	thee, and shameful spewing <i>shall be</i> on thy glory.
c62522	For the violence of Lebanon shall cover
c62523	thee, and the spoil of beasts, <i>which</i> made them afraid, because of men's blood, and for the violence of the land, of the city, and of all
c62524	that dwell therein.
c62525	What profiteth the graven image
c62526	that the maker thereof hath graven it; the molten image,
c62528	and a teacher of lies,
c62529	that the maker of his work trusteth therein,
c62530	to make dumb idols?
c62531	Woe
c62532	unto him that saith to the wood,
c62533	Awake;
c62534	Arise,
c62535	to the dumb stone,
c62536	it shall teach!
c62537	Behold, it <i>is</i> laid over with gold and silver,
c62538	and <i>there is</i> no breath at all in the midst of it.
c62539	But the LORD <i>is</i> in his holy temple:
c62540	keep silence before him.
c62541	let all the earth
c62542	A prayer of Habakkuk the prophet
c62543	upon Shigionoth.
c62544	O LORD,
c62545	I have heard thy speech,
c62546	<i>and</i> was afraid:
c62547	O LORD,
c62549	revive thy work in the midst of the years,
c62550	in the midst of the years make known;
c62551	in wrath remember mercy.
c62553	God came from Teman,
c62554	and the Holy One from mount Paran.
c62555	Selah.
c62556	His glory covered the heavens,
c62557	and the earth was full of his praise.
c62558	And <i>his</i> brightness was as the light;
c62559	he had horns <i>coming</i> out of his hand:
c62560	and there <i>was</i> the hiding of his power.
c62561	Before him went the pestilence,
c62562	and burning coals went forth at his feet.
c62563	He stood,
c62564	and measured the earth:
c62565	he beheld,
c62566	and drove asunder the nations;
c62567	and the everlasting mountains were scattered,
c62568	the perpetual hills did bow:
c62569	his ways <i>are</i> everlasting.
c62570	I saw the tents of Cushan in affliction:
c62571	<i>and</i> the curtains of the land of Midian did tremble.
c62572	displeased against the rivers?
c62573	Was the LORD
c62574	<i>was</i> thine anger against the rivers?
c62575	<i>was</i> thy wrath against the sea,
c62576	that thou didst ride upon thine horses
c62577	<i>and</i> thy chariots of salvation?
c62578	Thy bow was made quite naked,
c62579	<i>according</i> to the oaths of the tribes, <i>even thy</i> word.
c62580	Selah.
c62581	Thou didst cleave the earth with rivers.
c62583	The mountains saw thee, <i>and</i> they trembled:
c62584	the overflowing of the water passed by:
c62585	the deep uttered his voice,
c62586	<i>and</i> lifted up his hands on high.
c62587	The sun <i>and</i> moon stood still in their habitation:
c62588	at the light of thine arrows they went,
c62589	<i>and</i> at the shining of thy glittering spear.
c62590	Thou didst march through the land in indignation,
c62591	thou didst thresh the heathen in anger.
c62592	Thou wentest forth for the salvation of thy people,
c62593	<i>even</i> for salvation with thine anointed;
c62594	thou woundedst the head out of the house of the wicked,
c62595	by discovering the foundation unto the neck.
c62596	Selah.
c62597	Thou didst strike through with his staves the head of his villages:
c62598	they came out as a whirlwind
c62599	to scatter
c62600	me: their rejoicing
c62601	<i>was</i> as to devour the poor secretly.
c62602	Thou didst walk through the sea with thine horses,
c62603	<i>through</i> the heap of great waters.
c62604	When I heard,
c62605	my belly trembled;
c62606	my lips quivered at the voice:
c62607	rottenness entered into my bones,
c62608	and I trembled in
c62609	myself, that I might rest in the day of trouble:
c62610	when he cometh up unto the people,
c62611	he will invade them with his troops.
c62612	Although the fig tree shall not blossom,
c62613	neither <i>shall</i> fruit <i>be</i> in the vines;
c62614	the labour of the olive shall fail,
c62615	and the fields shall yield no meat;
c62616	the flock shall be cut off from the fold,
c62617	and <i>there shall be</i> no herd in the stalls:
c62618	Yet I will rejoice in the LORD,
c62619	I will joy in the God of my salvation.
c62620	The LORD God <i>is</i> my strength,
c62621	and he will make my feet like hinds'
c62622	<i>feet,</i> and he will make me to walk upon mine high places.
c62623	To the chief singer on my stringed instruments.
c62624	The word of the LORD
c62625	which came unto Zephaniah the son of Cushi, the son of Gedaliah, the son of Amariah, the son of Hizkiah, in the days of Josiah the son of Amon, king of Judah.
c62626	I will utterly consume all <i>things</i> from off the land,
c62627	saith the LORD.
c62628	I will consume man and beast;
c62629	I will consume the fowls of the heaven, and the fishes of the sea, and the stumblingblocks
c62630	with the wicked;
c62631	and I will cut off man from off the land,
c62632	saith the LORD.
c62633	I will also stretch out mine hand upon Judah, and upon all the inhabitants of Jerusalem;
c62634	and I will cut off the remnant of Baal from this place,
c62635	<i>and</i> the name of the Chemarims with the priests;
c62636	And them that worship the host of heaven upon the housetops;
c62637	and them that worship
c62638	<i>and</i> that swear by the LORD,
c62639	and that swear by Malcham;
c62640	And them that are turned back from the LORD;
c62641	and <i>those</i> that have not sought the LORD,
c62642	nor enquired for him.
c62643	Hold thy peace at the presence of the Lord GOD:
c62644	for the day of the LORD <i>is</i> at hand:
c62645	for the LORD hath prepared a sacrifice,
c62646	he hath bid his guests.
c62647	And it shall come to pass in the day of the LORD'S sacrifice,
c62648	that I will punish the princes, and the king's children, and all
c62649	such as are clothed with strange apparel.
c62651	In the same day also will I punish all those that leap on the threshold,
c62652	which fill their masters' houses with violence and deceit.
c62653	And it shall come to pass in that day,
c62654	saith the LORD,
c62655	<i>that there shall be</i> the noise of a cry from the fish gate,
c62656	and an howling from the second,
c62657	and a great crashing from the hills.
c62658	Howl,
c62659	ye inhabitants of Maktesh,
c62660	for all the merchant people are cut down;
c62661	all they that bear silver are cut off.
c62662	And it shall come to pass at that time,
c62663	<i>that</i> I will search Jerusalem with candles,
c62664	and punish the men
c62665	that are settled on their lees:
c62666	that say in their heart,
c62667	The LORD will not do good,
c62668	neither will he do evil.
c62669	Therefore their goods shall become a booty,
c62670	and their houses a desolation:
c62671	they shall also build houses,
c62672	but not inhabit
c62673	<i>them;</i> and they shall plant vineyards,
c62674	but not drink the wine thereof.
c62675	The great day of the LORD <i>is</i> near,
c62676	<i>it is</i> near,
c62677	and hasteth greatly,
c62678	<i>even</i> the voice of the day of the LORD: the mighty man shall cry there bitterly.
c62680	That day <i>is</i> a day of wrath,
c62681	a day of trouble and distress,
c62682	a day of wasteness and desolation,
c62683	a day of darkness and gloominess,
c62684	a day of clouds and thick darkness,
c62685	A day of the trumpet and alarm against the fenced cities, and against the high towers.
c62686	And I will bring distress upon men,
c62687	that they shall walk like blind men,
c62688	because they have sinned against the LORD:
c62689	and their blood shall be poured out as dust,
c62690	and their flesh as the dung.
c62691	Neither their silver nor their gold shall be able
c62692	to deliver them in the day of the LORD'S wrath;
c62693	but the whole land shall be devoured by the fire of his jealousy:
c62694	for he shall make even a speedy riddance of all them that dwell in the land.
c62695	Gather yourselves together,
c62696	yea, gather together,
c62697	O nation
c62698	not desired;
c62699	Before the decree bring forth,
c62700	<i>before</i> the day pass as the chaff,
c62701	before the fierce anger of the LORD come upon
c62702	you, before the day of the LORD'S anger come upon you.
c62703	Seek ye the LORD,
c62704	all ye meek of the earth,
c62705	which have wrought his judgment;
c62706	seek righteousness,
c62707	seek meekness:
c62708	it may be ye shall be hid in the day of the LORD'S anger.
c62709	For Gaza shall be forsaken,
c62710	and Ashkelon a desolation:
c62711	they shall drive out Ashdod at the noon day,
c62712	and Ekron shall be rooted up.
c62713	Woe
c62714	unto the inhabitants of the sea coast,
c62715	the nation of the Cherethites!
c62716	the word of the LORD <i>is</i> against
c62717	you; O Canaan,
c62718	the land of the Philistines,
c62719	I will even destroy thee, that there shall be no inhabitant.
c62720	And the sea coast shall be dwellings <i>and</i> cottages for shepherds, and folds for flocks.
c62721	And the coast shall be for the remnant of the house of Judah;
c62722	they shall feed thereupon:
c62723	in the houses of Ashkelon shall they lie down in the evening:
c62724	for the LORD their God shall visit
c62725	them, and turn away their captivity.
c62726	I have heard the reproach of Moab,
c62727	and the revilings of the children of Ammon,
c62728	whereby they have reproached my people,
c62729	and magnified <i>themselves</i> against their border.
c62730	Therefore
c62731	<i>as</i> I live,
c62732	saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel,
c62733	Surely Moab shall be as Sodom,
c62734	and the children of Ammon as Gomorrah,
c62735	<i>even</i> the breeding of nettles, and saltpits, and a perpetual desolation:
c62736	the residue of my people shall spoil
c62737	them, and the remnant of my people shall possess them.
c62738	This shall they have for their pride,
c62739	because they have reproached
c62740	and magnified <i>themselves</i> against the people of the LORD of hosts.
c62741	The LORD <i>will be</i> terrible unto
c62742	them: for he will famish all the gods of the earth;
c62743	and <i>men</i> shall worship
c62744	him, every one from his place,
c62745	<i>even</i> all the isles of the heathen.
c62746	Ye Ethiopians also,
c62748	ye <i>shall be</i> slain by my sword.
c62749	And he will stretch out his hand against the north,
c62750	and destroy Assyria;
c62751	and will make Nineveh a desolation,
c62752	<i>and</i> dry like a wilderness.
c62753	And flocks shall lie down in the midst of her, all the beasts of the nations:
c62754	both the cormorant and the bittern shall lodge in the upper lintels
c62755	of it; <i>their</i> voice shall sing in the windows;
c62756	desolation <i>shall be</i> in the thresholds:
c62757	for he shall uncover the cedar work.
c62758	This <i>is</i> the rejoicing city
c62759	that dwelt carelessly,
c62760	that said in her heart,
c62761	I
c62762	<i>am,</i> and <i>there is</i> none beside
c62763	me: how is she become a desolation,
c62764	a place for beasts to lie down
c62765	in! every one
c62766	that passeth by
c62767	her shall hiss,
c62768	<i>and</i> wag his hand.
c62769	Woe
c62770	to her that is filthy
c62771	and polluted,
c62772	to the oppressing city!
c62773	She obeyed not the voice;
c62774	she received not correction;
c62775	she trusted not in the LORD;
c62776	she drew not near to her God.
c62777	Her princes within her <i>are</i> roaring lions;
c62778	her judges <i>are</i> evening wolves;
c62779	they gnaw not the bones till the morrow.
c62780	Her prophets <i>are</i> light
c62781	<i>and</i> treacherous persons:
c62782	her priests have polluted the sanctuary,
c62783	they have done violence to the law.
c62784	The just LORD <i>is</i> in the midst
c62785	thereof; he will not do iniquity:
c62786	every morning doth he bring his judgment
c62787	to light, he faileth not;
c62788	but the unjust knoweth no shame.
c62789	I have cut off the nations:
c62790	their towers are desolate;
c62791	I made their streets waste, that none passeth by:
c62792	their cities are destroyed, so that there is no man, that there is none inhabitant.
c62793	I said,
c62794	Surely thou wilt fear
c62795	me, thou wilt receive instruction;
c62796	so their dwelling should not be cut off, howsoever
c62797	I punished
c62798	them: but they rose early,
c62799	<i>and</i> corrupted all their doings.
c62800	Therefore
c62801	wait
c62802	ye upon me, saith the LORD,
c62803	until the day
c62804	that I rise up to the prey:
c62805	for my determination
c62806	<i>is</i> to gather the nations,
c62807	that I may assemble the kingdoms,
c62808	to pour upon them mine indignation, <i>even</i> all my fierce anger:
c62809	for all the earth shall be devoured with the fire of my jealousy.
c62810	For then will I turn to the people a pure language,
c62811	that they may all call upon the name of the LORD,
c62812	to serve him with one consent.
c62813	From beyond the rivers of Ethiopia my suppliants, <i>even</i> the daughter of my dispersed, shall bring mine offering.
c62814	In that day shalt thou not be ashamed for all thy doings,
c62815	wherein thou hast transgressed
c62816	against me: for then I will take away out of the midst of thee them that rejoice in thy pride,
c62817	and thou shalt no more
c62818	be haughty because of my holy mountain.
c62819	I will also leave in the midst of thee an afflicted and poor people,
c62820	and they shall trust in the name of the LORD.
c62821	The remnant of Israel shall not do iniquity,
c62822	nor speak lies;
c62823	neither shall a deceitful tongue be found in their mouth:
c62824	for they shall feed
c62825	and lie down,
c62826	and none shall make <i>them</i> afraid.
c62827	Sing,
c62828	O daughter of Zion;
c62829	shout,
c62830	O Israel;
c62831	be glad
c62832	and rejoice with all the heart,
c62833	O daughter of Jerusalem.
c62834	The LORD hath taken away thy judgments,
c62835	he hath cast out thine enemy:
c62836	the king of Israel, <i>even</i> the LORD, <i>is</i> in the midst
c62837	of thee: thou shalt not see evil any more.
c62838	In that day it shall be said to Jerusalem,
c62839	Fear thou not:
c62840	<i>and to</i> Zion,
c62841	Let not thine hands be slack.
c62842	The LORD thy God in the midst
c62843	of thee <i>is</i> mighty;
c62844	he will save,
c62845	he will rejoice over thee with joy;
c62846	he will rest in his love,
c62847	he will joy over thee with singing.
c62848	<i>them that are</i> sorrowful for the solemn assembly,
c62849	I will gather
c62850	<i>who</i> are of
c62851	thee, <i>to whom</i> the reproach of it <i>was</i> a burden.
c62852	Behold, at that time I will undo all that afflict
c62853	thee: and I will save her that halteth,
c62854	and gather her that was driven out;
c62855	and I will get them praise and fame
c62856	in every land where they have been put to shame.
c62857	At that time will I bring
c62858	you <i>again,</i> even in the time
c62859	that I gather
c62860	you: for I will make you a name and a praise among all people of the earth,
c62861	when I turn back your captivity before your eyes,
c62862	saith the LORD.
c62863	In the second year of Darius the king, in the sixth month, in the first day of the month, came the word of the LORD by Haggai the prophet unto Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to Joshua the son of Josedech, the high priest,
c62864	saying,
c62865	Thus speaketh the LORD of hosts,
c62866	saying,
c62867	This people say,
c62868	The time is not come, the time that the LORD'S house
c62869	should be built.
c62870	Then came the word of the LORD by Haggai the prophet,
c62871	saying,
c62872	<i>Is it</i> time for you, O ye,
c62873	to dwell in your cieled houses,
c62874	and this house <i>lie</i> waste?
c62875	Now
c62876	therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts;
c62877	Consider your ways.
c62878	Ye have sown much,
c62879	and bring in little;
c62880	ye eat,
c62881	but ye have not enough;
c62882	ye drink,
c62883	but ye are not filled with drink;
c62885	ye clothe
c62886	you, but there is none warm;
c62888	and he that earneth wages earneth wages <i>to put it</i> into a bag with holes.
c62889	Thus saith the LORD of hosts;
c62890	Consider your ways.
c62891	Go up to the mountain,
c62892	and bring wood,
c62893	and build the house;
c62894	and I will take pleasure
c62895	in it, and I will be glorified,
c62896	saith the LORD.
c62897	Ye looked
c62898	for much,
c62899	and, lo, <i>it came</i> to little;
c62900	and when ye brought <i>it</i> home,
c62901	I did blow
c62902	upon it. Why?
c62903	saith the LORD of hosts.
c62904	Because of mine house
c62905	that <i>is</i> waste,
c62906	and ye run
c62907	every man unto his own house.
c62908	Therefore the heaven over you is stayed from dew,
c62909	and the earth is stayed <i>from</i> her fruit.
c62910	And I called for a drought upon the land, and upon the mountains, and upon the corn, and upon the new wine, and upon the oil,
c62912	and upon <i>that</i> which the ground bringeth forth,
c62913	and upon men, and upon cattle, and upon all the labour of the hands.
c62914	Then Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Joshua the son of Josedech, the high priest, with all the remnant of the people, obeyed the voice of the LORD their God, and the words of Haggai the prophet,
c62915	as the LORD their God had sent
c62916	him, and the people did fear before the LORD.
c62917	Then spake Haggai the LORD'S messenger in the LORD'S message unto the people,
c62918	saying,
c62919	I <i>am</i> with
c62920	you, saith the LORD.
c62921	And the LORD stirred up the spirit of Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and the spirit of Joshua the son of Josedech, the high priest, and the spirit of all the remnant of the people;
c62922	and they came
c62923	and did work in the house of the LORD of hosts, their God,
c62924	In the four and twentieth day of the sixth month, in the second year of Darius the king.
c62925	In the seventh <i>month,</i> in the one and twentieth <i>day</i> of the month, came the word of the LORD by the prophet Haggai,
c62926	saying,
c62927	Speak now to Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to Joshua the son of Josedech, the high priest, and to the residue of the people,
c62928	saying,
c62929	Who <i>is</i> left
c62930	among you that saw this house in her first glory?
c62931	and how do ye see it now?
c62932	<i>is it</i> not in your eyes in comparison of it as nothing?
c62933	Yet now be strong,
c62934	O Zerubbabel,
c62935	saith the LORD;
c62936	and be strong,
c62937	O Joshua, son of Josedech, the high priest;
c62938	and be strong,
c62939	all ye people of the land,
c62940	saith the LORD,
c62941	and work:
c62942	for I <i>am</i> with
c62943	you, saith the LORD of hosts:
c62944	<i>According to</i> the word
c62945	that I covenanted with
c62946	you when ye came out of Egypt,
c62947	so my spirit remaineth among
c62948	you: fear ye not.
c62949	For thus saith the LORD of hosts;
c62950	Yet once, it <i>is</i> a little while,
c62951	and I will shake the heavens, and the earth, and the sea, and the dry <i>land;</i>
c62952	And I will shake all nations,
c62953	and the desire of all nations shall come:
c62954	and I will fill this house with glory,
c62955	saith the LORD of hosts.
c62956	The silver
c62957	<i>is</i> mine, and the gold
c62958	<i>is</i> mine, saith the LORD of hosts.
c62959	The glory of this latter house shall be greater than of the former,
c62960	saith the LORD of hosts:
c62961	and in this place will I give peace,
c62962	saith the LORD of hosts.
c62963	In the four and twentieth <i>day</i> of the ninth <i>month,</i> in the second year of Darius, came the word of the LORD by Haggai the prophet,
c62964	saying,
c62965	Thus saith the LORD of hosts;
c62966	Ask now the priests <i>concerning</i> the law,
c62967	saying,
c62968	If one bear holy flesh in the skirt of his garment,
c62969	and with his skirt do touch bread, or pottage, or wine, or oil, or any meat,
c62970	shall it be holy?
c62971	And the priests answered
c62972	and said,
c62973	No.
c62974	Then said Haggai,
c62975	If <i>one that is</i> unclean by a dead body touch any of these,
c62976	shall it be unclean?
c62977	And the priests answered
c62978	and said,
c62979	It shall be unclean.
c62980	Then answered Haggai,
c62981	and said,
c62982	So <i>is</i> this people,
c62983	and so <i>is</i> this nation before
c62984	me, saith the LORD;
c62985	and so <i>is</i> every work of their hands;
c62986	and that which they offer there
c62987	<i>is</i> unclean.
c62988	And now, I pray you, consider from this day and upward,
c62989	from before a stone was laid upon a stone in the temple of the LORD:
c62990	Since those <i>days</i> were,
c62991	when <i>one</i> came to an heap of twenty
c62992	<i>measures,</i> there were <i>but</i> ten:
c62993	when <i>one</i> came to the pressfat
c62994	for to draw out fifty <i>vessels</i> out of the press,
c62995	there were <i>but</i> twenty.
c62996	I smote you with blasting and with mildew and with hail in
c62997	all the labours of your hands;
c62998	yet ye <i>turned</i> not to
c62999	me, saith the LORD.
c63000	Consider now from this day and upward, from the four and twentieth day of the ninth <i>month, even</i> from the day
c63001	that the foundation of the LORD'S temple was laid,
c63002	consider <i>it.</i>
c63003	Is the seed yet in the barn?
c63004	yea, as yet the vine, and the fig tree, and the pomegranate, and the olive tree, hath not brought forth:
c63005	from this day will I bless <i>you.</i>
c63006	And again the word of the LORD came unto Haggai in the four and twentieth <i>day</i> of the month,
c63007	saying,
c63008	Speak to Zerubbabel, governor of Judah,
c63009	saying,
c63010	I will shake the heavens and the earth;
c63011	And I will overthrow the throne of kingdoms,
c63012	and I will destroy the strength of the kingdoms of the heathen;
c63013	and I will overthrow the chariots, and those that ride
c63014	in them; and the horses and their riders shall come down,
c63015	every one by the sword of his brother.
c63016	In that day,
c63017	saith the LORD of hosts,
c63018	will I take
c63019	thee, O Zerubbabel, my servant, the son of Shealtiel,
c63020	saith the LORD,
c63021	and will make thee as a signet:
c63022	for I have chosen
c63023	thee, saith the LORD of hosts.
c63024	In the eighth month, in the second year of Darius, came the word of the LORD unto Zechariah, the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo the prophet,
c63025	saying,
c63026	The LORD hath been sore displeased with your fathers.
c63027	Therefore say thou unto
c63028	them, Thus saith the LORD of hosts;
c63029	Turn ye unto
c63030	me, saith the LORD of hosts,
c63031	and I will turn unto
c63032	you, saith the LORD of hosts.
c63033	Be ye not as your fathers,
c63034	unto whom the former prophets have cried,
c63035	saying,
c63036	Thus saith the LORD of hosts;
c63037	Turn ye now from your evil ways, and <i>from</i> your evil doings:
c63038	but they did not hear,
c63039	nor hearken unto
c63040	me, saith the LORD.
c63041	Your fathers,
c63042	where <i>are</i> they?
c63043	and the prophets,
c63044	do they live for ever?
c63045	But my words and my statutes,
c63046	which I commanded my servants the prophets,
c63047	did they not take hold of your fathers?
c63048	and they returned
c63049	and said,
c63050	Like as the LORD of hosts thought
c63051	to do unto us, according to our ways, and according to our doings,
c63052	so hath he dealt with us.
c63053	Upon the four and twentieth day of the eleventh month,
c63054	which <i>is</i> the month Sebat,
c63055	in the second year of Darius, came the word of the LORD unto Zechariah, the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo the prophet,
c63056	saying,
c63057	I saw by night,
c63058	and behold
c63059	a man
c63060	riding upon a red horse,
c63061	and he stood among the myrtle trees
c63062	that <i>were</i> in the bottom;
c63063	and behind him <i>were there</i> red horses, speckled, and white.
c63064	Then said
c63065	what <i>are</i> these?
c63066	I, O my lord,
c63067	And the angel that talked with me said unto
c63069	me, I will shew
c63070	thee what these <i>be.</i>
c63071	And the man that stood among the myrtle trees answered
c63073	and said,
c63074	These
c63075	<i>are they</i> whom the LORD hath sent
c63076	to walk to and fro through the earth.
c63077	And they answered the angel of the LORD
c63078	that stood among the myrtle trees,
c63079	and said,
c63080	We have walked to and fro through the earth,
c63081	and, behold,
c63082	all the earth sitteth still,
c63083	and is at rest.
c63084	Then the angel of the LORD answered
c63085	and said,
c63086	O LORD of hosts,
c63087	how long wilt thou not have mercy on Jerusalem and on the cities of Judah,
c63088	against which thou hast had indignation these threescore and ten years?
c63089	And the LORD answered the angel
c63090	that talked
c63091	with me <i>with</i> good words <i>and</i> comfortable words.
c63092	So the angel that communed with me said unto
c63094	me, Cry
c63095	thou, saying,
c63096	Thus saith the LORD of hosts;
c63097	I am jealous for Jerusalem and for Zion with a great jealousy.
c63098	And I am very sore displeased with the heathen <i>that are</i> at ease:
c63099	for I was but a little displeased,
c63100	and they helped forward the affliction.
c63101	Therefore
c63102	thus saith the LORD;
c63103	I am returned to Jerusalem with mercies:
c63104	my house shall be built
c63105	in it, saith the LORD of hosts,
c63106	and a line shall be stretched forth upon Jerusalem.
c63107	Cry yet,
c63108	saying,
c63109	Thus saith the LORD of hosts;
c63110	My cities through prosperity shall yet be spread abroad;
c63111	and the LORD shall yet comfort Zion,
c63112	and shall yet choose Jerusalem.
c63113	Then lifted I up mine eyes,
c63114	and saw,
c63115	and behold
c63116	four horns.
c63117	And I said unto the angel
c63118	that talked
c63119	with me, What <i>be</i> these?
c63120	And he answered
c63121	me, These <i>are</i> the horns
c63122	which have scattered Judah, Israel, and Jerusalem.
c63123	And the LORD shewed me four carpenters.
c63124	Then said
c63125	I, What come these
c63126	to do?
c63127	And he spake,
c63128	saying,
c63129	These <i>are</i> the horns
c63130	which have scattered Judah,
c63131	so that no man did lift up his head:
c63132	but these are come
c63133	to fray
c63134	them, to cast out the horns of the Gentiles,
c63135	which lifted up <i>their</i> horn over the land of Judah
c63136	to scatter it.
c63137	I lifted up mine eyes
c63138	again, and looked,
c63139	and behold
c63140	a man
c63141	with a measuring line in his hand.
c63142	Then said
c63143	I, Whither goest thou?
c63144	And he said unto
c63145	me, To measure Jerusalem,
c63146	to see
c63147	what <i>is</i> the breadth
c63148	thereof, and what <i>is</i> the length thereof.
c63149	And, behold,
c63150	the angel
c63151	that talked
c63152	with me went forth,
c63153	and another angel went out
c63154	to meet him,
c63155	And said unto
c63156	him, Run,
c63157	speak to this young man,
c63158	saying,
c63159	Jerusalem shall be inhabited <i>as</i> towns without walls for the multitude of men and cattle therein:
c63160	For I, saith the LORD, will be
c63162	unto her a wall of fire round about,
c63163	and will be the glory in the midst of her.
c63164	Ho, ho,
c63165	<i>come forth,</i> and flee from the land of the north,
c63166	saith the LORD:
c63167	for I have spread you abroad as the four winds of the heaven,
c63168	saith the LORD.
c63169	O
c63170	Zion,
c63171	Deliver thyself,
c63172	that dwellest <i>with</i> the daughter of Babylon.
c63173	For thus saith the LORD of hosts;
c63174	After the glory hath he sent me unto the nations
c63175	which spoiled
c63176	you: for
c63177	he that toucheth
c63178	you toucheth the apple of his eye.
c63179	For, behold, I will shake mine hand upon
c63180	them, and they shall be a spoil to their servants:
c63181	and ye shall know
c63182	that the LORD of hosts hath sent me.
c63183	Sing
c63184	and rejoice,
c63185	O daughter of Zion:
c63186	for, lo, I come,
c63187	and I will dwell in the midst
c63188	of thee, saith the LORD.
c63189	And many nations shall be joined to the LORD in that day,
c63190	and shall be my people:
c63191	and I will dwell in the midst
c63192	of thee, and thou shalt know
c63193	that the LORD of hosts hath sent me unto thee.
c63194	And the LORD shall inherit Judah his portion in the holy land,
c63195	and shall choose Jerusalem again.
c63196	Be silent,
c63197	O all flesh,
c63198	before the LORD:
c63199	for he is raised up out of his holy habitation.
c63200	And he shewed me Joshua the high priest
c63201	standing before the angel of the LORD,
c63202	and Satan standing at his right hand
c63203	to resist him.
c63204	And the LORD said unto Satan,
c63205	The LORD rebuke
c63206	thee, O Satan;
c63207	even the LORD that hath chosen Jerusalem rebuke
c63209	thee: <i>is</i> not this a brand
c63210	plucked out of the fire?
c63211	Now Joshua was clothed with filthy garments,
c63212	and stood before the angel.
c63213	And he answered
c63214	and spake
c63215	unto those that stood before
c63216	him, saying,
c63217	Take away the filthy garments from
c63218	him. And unto him he said,
c63219	Behold,
c63220	I have caused thine iniquity to pass from
c63221	thee, and I will clothe thee with change of raiment.
c63222	And I said,
c63223	Let them set a fair mitre upon his head.
c63224	So they set a fair mitre upon his head,
c63225	and clothed him with garments.
c63226	And the angel of the LORD stood by.
c63227	And the angel of the LORD protested unto Joshua,
c63228	saying,
c63229	Thus saith the LORD of hosts;
c63230	If thou wilt walk in my ways,
c63231	and if thou wilt keep my charge,
c63232	then thou shalt also judge my house,
c63233	and shalt also keep my courts,
c63234	and I will give thee places to walk among these that stand by.
c63235	Hear now,
c63236	O Joshua the high priest,
c63237	thou, and thy fellows
c63238	that sit before
c63239	thee: for they <i>are</i> men wondered
c63240	at: for, behold, I will bring forth my servant the BRANCH.
c63241	For behold the stone
c63242	that I have laid before Joshua;
c63243	upon one stone <i>shall be</i> seven eyes:
c63244	behold, I will engrave the graving
c63245	thereof, saith the LORD of hosts,
c63246	and I will remove the iniquity of that land in one day.
c63247	In that day,
c63248	saith the LORD of hosts,
c63249	shall ye call
c63250	every man his neighbour
c63251	under the vine and under the fig tree.
c63252	And the angel that talked with me came again,
c63254	and waked me, as a man
c63255	that is wakened out of his sleep,
c63256	And said unto
c63257	me, What seest thou?
c63258	And I said,
c63259	I have looked,
c63260	and behold a candlestick all <i>of</i> gold,
c63261	with a bowl upon the top
c63262	of it, and his seven lamps thereon,
c63263	and seven pipes to the seven lamps,
c63264	which <i>are</i> upon the top thereof:
c63265	And two olive trees by
c63266	it, one upon the right <i>side</i> of the bowl,
c63267	and the other upon the left <i>side</i> thereof.
c63268	So I answered
c63269	and spake to the angel
c63270	that talked
c63271	with me, saying,
c63272	What <i>are</i> these,
c63273	my lord?
c63274	Then the angel that talked with me answered
c63276	and said unto
c63277	me, Knowest thou not
c63278	what these
c63279	be? And I said,
c63280	No,
c63281	my lord.
c63282	Then he answered
c63283	and spake unto
c63284	me, saying,
c63285	This <i>is</i> the word of the LORD unto Zerubbabel,
c63286	saying,
c63287	Not by might,
c63288	nor by power,
c63289	but by my spirit,
c63290	saith the LORD of hosts.
c63291	Who <i>art</i> thou,
c63292	O great mountain?
c63293	before Zerubbabel <i>thou shalt become</i> a plain:
c63294	and he shall bring forth the headstone <i>thereof with</i> shoutings,
c63295	<i>crying,</i> Grace, grace unto it.
c63296	Moreover the word of the LORD came unto
c63297	me, saying,
c63298	The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house;
c63299	his hands shall also finish
c63300	it; and thou shalt know
c63301	that the LORD of hosts hath sent me unto you.
c63302	For who hath despised the day of small things?
c63303	for they shall rejoice,
c63304	and shall see the plummet in the hand of Zerubbabel
c63305	<i>with</i> those seven;
c63306	they <i>are</i> the eyes of the LORD,
c63307	which run to and fro through the whole earth.
c63308	Then answered
c63309	I, and said unto
c63310	him, What <i>are</i> these two olive trees upon the right <i>side</i> of the candlestick and upon the left <i>side</i> thereof?
c63311	And I answered again,
c63312	and said unto
c63313	him, What <i>be these</i> two olive branches
c63314	which through the two golden pipes
c63315	empty the golden <i>oil</i> out of themselves?
c63316	And he answered
c63317	me and said,
c63318	Knowest thou not
c63319	what these
c63320	<i>be?</i> And I said,
c63321	No,
c63322	my lord.
c63323	Then said
c63324	he, These <i>are</i> the two anointed ones,
c63325	that stand by the Lord of the whole earth.
c63326	Then I turned,
c63327	and lifted up mine eyes,
c63328	and looked,
c63329	and behold a flying roll.
c63330	And he said unto
c63331	me, What seest thou?
c63332	And I answered,
c63333	I see a flying roll;
c63334	the length thereof <i>is</i> twenty cubits,
c63335	and the breadth thereof ten cubits.
c63336	Then said he unto
c63337	me, This <i>is</i> the curse
c63338	that goeth forth over the face of the whole earth:
c63339	for every one
c63340	that stealeth
c63341	shall be cut off <i>as</i> on this side according to it;
c63342	and every
c63343	one that sweareth
c63344	shall be cut off <i>as</i> on that side according to it.
c63345	I will bring it forth,
c63346	saith the LORD of hosts,
c63347	and it shall enter into the house of the thief, and into the house
c63348	of him that sweareth falsely by my name:
c63349	and it shall remain in the midst of his house,
c63350	and shall consume
c63351	it with the timber thereof and the stones thereof.
c63352	Then the angel that talked with me went forth,
c63354	and said unto
c63355	me, Lift up now thine eyes,
c63356	and see
c63357	what <i>is</i> this that goeth forth.
c63358	And I said,
c63359	What <i>is</i> it?
c63360	And he said,
c63361	This <i>is</i> an ephah
c63362	that goeth forth.
c63363	He said
c63364	moreover, This <i>is</i> their resemblance through all the earth.
c63365	And, behold,
c63366	there was lifted up a talent of lead:
c63367	and this <i>is</i> a woman
c63368	that sitteth in the midst of the ephah.
c63369	And he said,
c63370	This <i>is</i> wickedness.
c63371	And he cast it into the midst of the ephah;
c63372	and he cast the weight of lead upon the mouth thereof.
c63373	Then lifted I up mine eyes,
c63374	and looked,
c63375	and, behold, there came out two women,
c63376	and the wind <i>was</i> in their wings;
c63377	for they had wings like the wings of a stork:
c63378	and they lifted up the ephah between the earth and the heaven.
c63379	Then said I to the angel
c63380	that talked
c63381	with me, Whither do these bear the ephah?
c63382	And he said unto
c63383	me, To build it an house in the land of Shinar:
c63384	and it shall be established,
c63385	and set there upon her own base.
c63386	And I turned,
c63387	and lifted up mine eyes,
c63388	and looked,
c63389	and, behold,
c63390	there came four chariots out from between two mountains;
c63391	and the mountains <i>were</i> mountains of brass.
c63392	In the first chariot <i>were</i> red horses;
c63393	and in the second chariot black horses;
c63394	And in the third chariot white horses;
c63395	and in the fourth chariot grisled and bay horses.
c63396	Then I answered
c63397	and said unto the angel
c63398	that talked
c63399	with me, What <i>are</i> these,
c63400	my lord?
c63401	And the angel answered
c63402	and said unto
c63403	me, These <i>are</i> the four spirits of the heavens, which go forth
c63404	from standing before the Lord of all the earth.
c63405	The black horses which
c63406	<i>are</i> therein go forth into the north country;
c63407	and the white go forth after
c63408	them; and the grisled go forth toward the south country.
c63409	And the bay went forth,
c63410	and sought
c63411	to go
c63412	that they might walk to and fro through the earth:
c63413	and he said,
c63414	Get you hence,
c63415	walk to and fro through the earth.
c63416	So they walked to and fro through the earth.
c63417	Then cried
c63418	he upon me, and spake unto
c63419	me, saying,
c63420	Behold,
c63421	these that go toward the north country
c63422	have quieted my spirit in the north country.
c63423	And the word of the LORD came unto
c63424	me, saying,
c63425	Take of <i>them of</i> the captivity, <i>even</i> of Heldai, of Tobijah, and of Jedaiah,
c63426	thou the same day, and go
c63427	into the house of Josiah the son of Zephaniah;
c63428	which are come from Babylon, and come
c63429	Then take silver and gold,
c63430	and make crowns,
c63431	and set <i>them</i> upon the head of Joshua the son of Josedech, the high priest;
c63432	And speak unto
c63433	him, saying,
c63434	Thus speaketh the LORD of hosts,
c63435	saying,
c63436	Behold the man
c63437	whose name <i>is</i> The BRANCH;
c63438	and he shall grow up out of his place,
c63439	and he shall build the temple of the LORD:
c63440	Even he shall build the temple of the LORD;
c63441	and he shall bear the glory,
c63442	and shall sit
c63443	and rule upon his throne;
c63444	and he shall be a priest upon his throne:
c63445	and the counsel of peace shall be between them both.
c63446	And the crowns shall be to Helem, and to Tobijah, and to Jedaiah, and to Hen the son of Zephaniah, for a memorial in the temple of the LORD.
c63447	And they <i>that are</i> far off shall come
c63448	and build in the temple of the LORD,
c63449	and ye shall know
c63450	that the LORD of hosts hath sent me unto
c63451	you. And <i>this</i> shall come to pass,
c63452	if ye will diligently obey the voice of the LORD your God.
c63453	And it came to pass in the fourth year of king Darius,
c63454	<i>that</i> the word of the LORD came unto Zechariah in the fourth <i>day</i> of the ninth month, <i>even</i> in Chisleu;
c63455	When they had sent unto the house of God Sherezer and Regemmelech, and their men,
c63456	to pray before the LORD,
c63457	<i>And</i> to speak unto the priests
c63458	which <i>were</i> in the house of the LORD of hosts,
c63459	and to the prophets,
c63460	saying,
c63461	Should I weep in the fifth month,
c63462	separating myself,
c63463	as I have done these so many years?
c63464	Then came the word of the LORD of hosts unto
c63465	me, saying,
c63466	Speak unto all the people of the land, and to the priests,
c63467	saying,
c63468	When ye fasted
c63469	and mourned
c63470	in the fifth and seventh
c63471	<i>month,</i> even those seventy years,
c63472	did ye at all fast unto me, <i>even</i> to me?
c63473	And when ye did eat,
c63474	and when ye did drink,
c63475	did not ye
c63476	eat
c63478	<i>for yourselves,</i> and drink <i>for yourselves?</i>
c63479	<i>Should ye</i> not <i>hear</i> the words
c63480	which the LORD hath cried by the former prophets,
c63481	when Jerusalem was inhabited and in prosperity,
c63482	and the cities thereof round about her, when <i>men</i> inhabited the south and the plain?
c63483	And the word of the LORD came unto Zechariah,
c63484	saying,
c63485	Thus speaketh the LORD of hosts,
c63486	saying,
c63487	Execute true judgment,
c63488	and shew mercy and compassions
c63489	every man to his brother:
c63490	And oppress not the widow, nor the fatherless, the stranger, nor the poor;
c63491	and let none of you imagine evil against his brother in your heart.
c63492	But they refused
c63493	to hearken,
c63494	and pulled away the shoulder,
c63495	and stopped their ears,
c63496	that they should not hear.
c63497	Yea, they made their hearts <i>as</i> an adamant stone,
c63498	lest they should hear the law, and the words
c63499	which the LORD of hosts hath sent in his spirit by the former prophets:
c63500	therefore came a great wrath from the LORD of hosts.
c63501	Therefore it is come to pass,
c63502	<i>that</i> as he cried,
c63503	and they would not hear;
c63504	so they cried,
c63505	and I would not hear,
c63506	saith the LORD of hosts:
c63507	But I scattered them with a whirlwind among all the nations
c63508	whom they knew not.
c63509	Thus the land was desolate after them, that no man passed through nor returned: for they laid the pleasant land desolate.
c63511	Again the word of the LORD of hosts came
c63512	<i>to me,</i> saying,
c63513	Thus saith the LORD of hosts;
c63514	I was jealous for Zion with great jealousy,
c63515	and I was jealous for her with great fury.
c63516	Thus saith the LORD;
c63517	I am returned unto Zion,
c63518	and will dwell in the midst of Jerusalem:
c63519	and Jerusalem shall be called a city of truth;
c63520	and the mountain of the LORD of hosts the holy mountain.
c63521	Thus saith the LORD of hosts;
c63522	There shall yet old men and old women dwell in the streets of Jerusalem,
c63523	and every man
c63524	with his staff in his hand for very age.
c63525	And the streets of the city shall be full of boys and girls
c63526	playing in the streets thereof.
c63527	Thus saith the LORD of hosts;
c63528	If it be marvellous in the eyes of the remnant of this people in these days,
c63529	should it also be marvellous in mine eyes?
c63530	saith the LORD of hosts.
c63531	Thus saith the LORD of hosts;
c63532	Behold, I will save my people from the east country, and from the west country;
c63533	And I will bring
c63534	them, and they shall dwell in the midst of Jerusalem:
c63535	and they shall be my people,
c63536	and I will be their God, in truth and in righteousness.
c63537	Thus saith the LORD of hosts;
c63538	Let your hands be strong,
c63539	ye that hear in these days these words by the mouth of the prophets,
c63540	which <i>were</i> in the day
c63541	<i>that</i> the foundation of the house of the LORD of hosts was laid, that the temple
c63542	might be built.
c63543	For before these days there was no hire for man,
c63544	any hire for beast;
c63545	nor
c63546	neither <i>was there any</i> peace to him that went out or came in because of the affliction:
c63547	for I set all men
c63548	every one against his neighbour.
c63549	But now
c63550	I <i>will</i> not <i>be</i> unto the residue of this people as in the former days,
c63551	saith the LORD of hosts.
c63552	For the seed <i>shall be</i> prosperous;
c63553	the vine shall give her fruit,
c63554	and the ground shall give her increase,
c63555	and the heavens shall give their dew;
c63556	and I will cause the remnant of this people to possess all these <i>things.</i>
c63557	And it shall come to pass,
c63558	<i>that</i> as ye were a curse among the heathen,
c63559	O house of Judah, and house of Israel;
c63560	so will I save
c63561	you, and ye shall be a blessing:
c63562	fear not,
c63563	<i>but</i> let your hands be strong.
c63564	For thus saith the LORD of hosts;
c63565	As I thought
c63566	to punish
c63567	you, when your fathers provoked me to wrath,
c63568	saith the LORD of hosts,
c63569	and I repented not:
c63570	So again
c63571	have I thought in these days
c63572	to do well unto Jerusalem and to the house of Judah:
c63573	fear ye not.
c63574	These <i>are</i> the things
c63575	that ye shall do;
c63576	Speak ye every man the truth
c63577	to his neighbour;
c63578	execute the judgment of truth and peace in your gates:
c63580	And let none of you imagine evil in your hearts against his neighbour;
c63582	and love no false oath:
c63583	for all these
c63584	<i>are things</i> that I hate,
c63585	saith the LORD.
c63586	And the word of the LORD of hosts came unto
c63587	me, saying,
c63588	Thus saith the LORD of hosts;
c63589	The fast of the fourth <i>month,</i> and the fast of the fifth, and the fast of the seventh, and the fast of the tenth, shall be to the house of Judah joy and gladness, and cheerful feasts;
c63590	therefore love the truth and peace.
c63591	Thus saith the LORD of hosts;
c63592	<i>It shall</i> yet
c63593	<i>come to pass,</i> that there shall come people, and the inhabitants of many cities:
c63594	And the inhabitants of one <i>city</i> shall go to another,
c63595	saying,
c63596	Let us go speedily
c63597	to pray before the LORD,
c63598	and to seek the LORD of hosts:
c63599	I will go also.
c63600	Yea, many people and strong nations shall come
c63601	to seek the LORD of hosts in Jerusalem,
c63602	and to pray before the LORD.
c63603	Thus saith the LORD of hosts;
c63604	In those days
c63605	<i>it shall come to pass,</i> that ten men shall take hold out of all languages of the nations,
c63606	even shall take hold of the skirt of him that is a Jew,
c63607	saying,
c63608	We will go with
c63609	you: for we have heard
c63610	<i>that</i> God <i>is</i> with you.
c63611	The burden
c63612	of the word of the LORD in the land of Hadrach,
c63613	and Damascus <i>shall be</i> the rest
c63614	thereof: when the eyes of man, as of all the tribes of Israel, <i>shall be</i> toward the LORD.
c63616	And Hamath also
c63617	shall border
c63618	thereby; Tyrus, and Zidon,
c63619	though it be very wise.
c63620	And Tyrus did build herself a strong hold,
c63621	and heaped up silver as the dust,
c63622	and fine gold as the mire of the streets.
c63623	Behold, the Lord will cast her out,
c63624	and he will smite her power in the sea;
c63625	and she shall be devoured with fire.
c63626	Ashkelon shall see
c63627	<i>it,</i> and fear;
c63628	Gaza
c63629	also <i>shall see it,</i> and be very sorrowful,
c63630	and Ekron;
c63631	for her expectation shall be ashamed;
c63632	and the king shall perish from Gaza,
c63633	and Ashkelon shall not be inhabited.
c63634	And a bastard shall dwell in Ashdod,
c63635	and I will cut off the pride of the Philistines.
c63636	And I will take away his blood out of his mouth,
c63637	and his abominations from between his teeth:
c63638	but he that remaineth, even he, <i>shall be</i> for our God,
c63639	and he shall be as a governor in Judah,
c63640	and Ekron as a Jebusite.
c63641	And I will encamp about mine house because of the army, because of him that passeth by, and because of him that returneth:
c63642	and no oppressor shall pass through them any more:
c63643	for now have I seen with mine eyes.
c63644	Rejoice greatly,
c63645	O daughter of Zion;
c63646	shout,
c63647	O daughter of Jerusalem:
c63648	behold, thy King cometh
c63649	unto thee: he <i>is</i> just, and having salvation;
c63650	lowly,
c63651	and riding upon an ass, and upon a colt the foal of an ass.
c63652	And I will cut off the chariot from Ephraim,
c63653	and the horse from Jerusalem,
c63654	and the battle bow shall be cut off:
c63655	and he shall speak peace unto the heathen:
c63656	and his dominion <i>shall be</i> from sea <i>even</i> to sea,
c63657	and from the river <i>even</i> to the ends of the earth.
c63658	As for thee also,
c63659	by the blood of thy covenant I have sent forth thy prisoners out of the pit
c63660	wherein <i>is</i> no water.
c63661	Turn you to the strong hold,
c63662	ye prisoners of hope:
c63663	even to day do I declare
c63664	<i>that</i> I will render double unto thee;
c63665	When I have bent Judah
c63666	for me, filled the bow with Ephraim,
c63667	and raised up thy sons,
c63668	O Zion,
c63669	against thy sons,
c63670	O Greece,
c63671	and made thee as the sword of a mighty man.
c63672	And the LORD shall be seen over
c63673	them, and his arrow shall go forth as the lightning:
c63674	and the Lord GOD shall blow the trumpet,
c63675	and shall go with whirlwinds of the south.
c63676	The LORD of hosts shall defend
c63677	them; and they shall devour,
c63678	and subdue with sling stones;
c63679	and they shall drink,
c63680	<i>and</i> make a noise as through wine;
c63681	and they shall be filled like bowls, <i>and</i> as the corners of the altar.
c63682	And the LORD their God shall save them in that day as the flock of his people:
c63683	for they <i>shall be as</i> the stones of a crown,
c63684	lifted up as an ensign upon his land.
c63685	For how great <i>is</i> his goodness,
c63686	and how great <i>is</i> his beauty!
c63687	corn shall make the young men
c63688	cheerful, and new wine the maids.
c63689	Ask ye of the LORD rain in the time of the latter rain;
c63690	<i>so</i> the LORD shall make bright clouds,
c63691	and give them showers of rain,
c63692	to every one grass in the field.
c63693	For the idols have spoken vanity,
c63694	and the diviners have seen a lie,
c63695	and have told false dreams;
c63696	they comfort in vain:
c63697	therefore they went their way as a flock,
c63698	they were troubled,
c63699	because <i>there was</i> no shepherd.
c63700	Mine anger was kindled against the shepherds,
c63701	and I punished the goats:
c63702	for the LORD of hosts hath visited his flock the house of Judah,
c63703	and hath made them as his goodly horse in the battle.
c63704	Out of him came forth the corner,
c63705	out of him the nail,
c63706	out of him the battle bow,
c63707	out of him every oppressor together.
c63708	And they shall be as mighty
c63709	<i>men,</i> which tread down <i>their enemies</i> in the mire of the streets in the battle:
c63710	and they shall fight,
c63711	because the LORD <i>is</i> with
c63712	them, and the riders on horses shall be confounded.
c63713	And I will strengthen the house of Judah,
c63714	and I will save the house of Joseph,
c63715	and I will bring them again
c63716	to place them; for I have mercy upon
c63717	them: and they shall be
c63718	as though I had not cast them off:
c63719	for I <i>am</i> the LORD their God,
c63720	and will hear them.
c63721	And <i>they of</i> Ephraim shall be like a mighty
c63722	<i>man,</i> and their heart shall rejoice as through wine:
c63723	yea, their children shall see
c63724	<i>it,</i> and be glad;
c63725	their heart shall rejoice in the LORD.
c63726	I will hiss
c63727	for them, and gather
c63728	them; for I have redeemed
c63729	them: and they shall increase
c63730	as they have increased.
c63731	And I will sow them among the people:
c63732	and they shall remember me in far countries;
c63733	and they shall live with their children,
c63734	and turn again.
c63735	I will bring them again also out of the land of Egypt,
c63736	and gather them out of Assyria;
c63737	and I will bring them into the land of Gilead and Lebanon;
c63738	and <i>place</i> shall not be found for them.
c63739	And he shall pass through the sea with affliction,
c63740	and shall smite the waves in the sea,
c63741	and all the deeps of the river shall dry up:
c63742	and the pride of Assyria shall be brought down,
c63743	and the sceptre of Egypt shall depart away.
c63744	And I will strengthen them in the LORD;
c63745	and they shall walk up and down in his name,
c63746	saith the LORD.
c63747	Open
c63748	O Lebanon,
c63749	thy doors,
c63750	that the fire may devour thy cedars.
c63751	Howl,
c63752	fir tree;
c63753	for the cedar is fallen;
c63754	because the mighty are spoiled:
c63755	howl,
c63756	O ye oaks of Bashan;
c63757	for the forest of the vintage is come down.
c63758	<i>There is</i> a voice of the howling of the shepherds;
c63759	for their glory is spoiled:
c63760	a voice of the roaring of young lions;
c63761	for the pride of Jordan is spoiled.
c63762	Thus saith the LORD my God;
c63763	Feed the flock of the slaughter;
c63764	Whose possessors slay
c63765	them, and hold themselves not guilty:
c63766	and they that sell them say,
c63767	Blessed <i>be</i> the LORD;
c63768	for I am rich:
c63769	and their own shepherds pity them not.
c63770	For I will no more pity the inhabitants of the land,
c63771	saith the LORD:
c63772	but, lo,
c63773	I will deliver the men
c63774	every one into his neighbour's hand, and into the hand of his king:
c63775	and they shall smite the land,
c63776	and out of their hand I will not deliver <i>them.</i>
c63777	And I will feed the flock of slaughter,
c63778	<i>even</i> you, O poor of the flock.
c63779	And I took unto me two staves;
c63780	the one I called
c63781	Beauty,
c63782	and the other I called
c63783	Bands;
c63784	and I fed the flock.
c63785	Three shepherds also I cut off in one month;
c63786	and my soul lothed
c63787	them, and their soul also abhorred me.
c63788	Then said
c63789	I, I will not feed
c63790	you: that that dieth,
c63791	let it die;
c63793	and that that is to be cut off,
c63794	let it be cut off;
c63796	and let the rest
c63797	eat
c63798	every one the flesh of another.
c63799	And I took my staff, <i>even</i> Beauty,
c63800	and cut it asunder,
c63801	that I might break my covenant
c63802	which I had made with all the people.
c63803	And it was broken in that day:
c63804	and so the poor of the flock that waited upon me knew
c63806	that it <i>was</i> the word of the LORD.
c63807	And I said unto
c63808	them, If ye think good,
c63809	give <i>me</i> my price;
c63810	and if not,
c63811	forbear.
c63812	So they weighed for my price thirty <i>pieces</i> of silver.
c63813	And the LORD said unto
c63814	me, Cast it unto the potter:
c63815	a goodly price
c63816	that I was prised at of
c63817	them. And I took the thirty <i>pieces</i> of silver,
c63818	and cast them to the potter in the house of the LORD.
c63819	Then I cut asunder mine other staff, <i>even</i> Bands,
c63820	that I might break the brotherhood between Judah and Israel.
c63821	And the LORD said unto
c63822	me, Take unto thee yet the instruments of a foolish shepherd.
c63823	For, lo,
c63824	I will raise up a shepherd in the land,
c63825	<i>which</i> shall not visit those that be cut off,
c63826	neither shall seek the young one,
c63827	nor heal that that is broken,
c63828	nor feed that that standeth still:
c63829	but he shall eat the flesh of the fat,
c63830	and tear their claws in pieces.
c63831	Woe to the idol shepherd
c63832	that leaveth the flock!
c63833	the sword <i>shall be</i> upon his arm, and upon his right eye:
c63834	his arm shall be clean dried up,
c63835	and his right eye shall be utterly darkened.
c63836	The burden
c63837	of the word of the LORD for Israel,
c63838	saith the LORD,
c63839	which stretcheth forth the heavens,
c63840	and layeth the foundation of the earth,
c63841	and formeth the spirit of man within him.
c63842	Behold, I will make Jerusalem a cup of trembling unto all the people round about,
c63843	when they shall be in the siege both against Judah <i>and</i> against Jerusalem.
c63845	And in that day will I make Jerusalem a burdensome stone for all people:
c63846	all that burden themselves with it shall be cut in pieces,
c63847	though all the people of the earth be gathered together against it.
c63848	In that day,
c63849	saith the LORD,
c63850	I will smite every horse with astonishment,
c63851	and his rider with madness:
c63852	and I will open mine eyes upon the house of Judah,
c63853	and will smite every horse of the people with blindness.
c63854	And the governors of Judah shall say in their heart,
c63855	The inhabitants of Jerusalem <i>shall be</i> my strength in the LORD of hosts their God.
c63856	In that day will I make the governors of Judah like an hearth of fire among the wood,
c63857	and like a torch of fire in a sheaf;
c63858	and they shall devour all the people round about, on the right hand and on the left:
c63859	and Jerusalem shall be inhabited again in her own place, <i>even</i> in Jerusalem.
c63860	The LORD also shall save the tents of Judah first,
c63861	that the glory of the house of David and the glory of the inhabitants of Jerusalem do not magnify <i>themselves</i> against Judah.
c63862	In that day shall the LORD defend the inhabitants of Jerusalem;
c63864	and he that is feeble
c63865	among them at that day shall be as David;
c63866	and the house of David <i>shall be</i> as God, as the angel of the LORD before them.
c63867	And it shall come to pass
c63868	in that day, <i>that</i> I will seek
c63869	to destroy all the nations
c63870	that come against Jerusalem.
c63871	And I will pour upon the house of David, and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the spirit of grace and of supplications:
c63872	and they shall look upon
c63873	me whom they have pierced,
c63874	and they shall mourn for him, as one mourneth for <i>his</i> only
c63875	<i>son,</i> and shall be in bitterness for
c63876	him, as one that is in bitterness for <i>his</i> firstborn.
c63877	In that day shall there be a great mourning in Jerusalem, as the mourning of Hadadrimmon in the valley of Megiddon.
c63878	And the land shall mourn,
c63879	every family apart;
c63880	the family of the house of David apart,
c63881	and their wives apart;
c63882	the family of the house of Nathan apart,
c63883	and their wives apart;
c63884	The family of the house of Levi apart,
c63885	and their wives apart;
c63886	the family of Shimei apart,
c63887	and their wives apart;
c63888	All the families
c63889	that remain,
c63890	every family apart,
c63891	and their wives apart.
c63892	In that day there shall be a fountain opened to the house of David and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem for sin and for uncleanness.
c63893	And it shall come to pass in that day,
c63894	saith the LORD of hosts,
c63895	<i>that</i> I will cut off the names of the idols out of the land,
c63896	and they shall no more be remembered:
c63897	and also I will cause the prophets and the unclean spirit to pass out of the land.
c63898	And it shall come to pass,
c63899	<i>that</i> when any shall yet prophesy,
c63900	then his father and his mother that begat him shall say unto
c63902	him, Thou shalt not live;
c63903	for thou speakest lies in the name of the LORD:
c63904	and his father and his mother that begat him shall thrust him through
c63906	when he prophesieth.
c63907	And it shall come to pass
c63908	in that day, <i>that</i> the prophets shall be ashamed
c63909	every one of his vision,
c63910	when he hath prophesied;
c63911	neither shall they wear a rough garment
c63912	to deceive:
c63913	But he shall say,
c63914	I <i>am</i> no prophet,
c63915	<i>am</i> an husbandman;
c63917	I
c63918	for man taught me to keep cattle from my youth.
c63919	And <i>one</i> shall say unto
c63920	him, What <i>are</i> these wounds in thine hands?
c63921	Then he shall answer,
c63922	<i>Those</i> with which I was wounded <i>in</i> the house of my friends.
c63924	Awake, O sword, against my shepherd, and against the man <i>that is</i> my fellow, saith the LORD of hosts:
c63926	smite the shepherd,
c63927	and the sheep shall be scattered:
c63928	and I will turn mine hand upon the little ones.
c63929	And it shall come to pass, <i>that</i> in all the land,
c63930	saith the LORD,
c63931	two parts therein shall be cut off
c63932	<i>and</i> die;
c63933	but the third shall be left therein.
c63934	And I will bring the third part through the fire,
c63935	and will refine
c63936	them as silver is refined,
c63937	and will try
c63938	them as gold is tried:
c63939	they shall call on my name,
c63940	and I will hear
c63941	them: I will say,
c63942	It <i>is</i> my people:
c63943	and they shall say,
c63944	The LORD <i>is</i> my God.
c63945	Behold, the day of the LORD cometh,
c63946	and thy spoil shall be divided in the midst of thee.
c63947	For I will gather all nations against Jerusalem to battle;
c63948	and the city shall be taken,
c63949	and the houses rifled,
c63950	and the women ravished;
c63951	and half of the city shall go forth into captivity,
c63952	and the residue of the people shall not be cut off from the city.
c63953	Then shall the LORD go forth,
c63954	and fight against those nations, as when
c63955	he fought in the day of battle.
c63956	And his feet shall stand in that day upon the mount of Olives,
c63957	which <i>is</i> before Jerusalem on the east,
c63958	and the mount of Olives shall cleave in the midst thereof toward the east and toward the west,
c63959	<i>and there shall be</i> a very great valley;
c63960	and half of the mountain shall remove toward the north,
c63961	and half of it toward the south.
c63962	And ye shall flee <i>to</i> the valley of the mountains;
c63963	for the valley of the mountains shall reach unto Azal:
c63964	yea, ye shall flee,
c63965	like as ye fled from before the earthquake in the days of Uzziah king of Judah:
c63966	and the LORD my God shall come,
c63967	<i>and</i> all the saints with thee.
c63968	And it shall come to pass
c63969	in that day, <i>that</i> the light shall not be clear, <i>nor</i> dark:
c63970	But it shall be
c63971	one day which
c63972	shall be known to the LORD,
c63973	not day,
c63974	nor night:
c63975	but it shall come to pass,
c63976	<i>that</i> at evening time it shall be light.
c63977	And it shall be
c63978	in that day, <i>that</i> living waters shall go out from Jerusalem;
c63979	half of them toward the former sea,
c63980	and half of them toward the hinder sea:
c63981	in summer and in winter shall it be.
c63982	And the LORD shall be king over all the earth:
c63983	in that day shall there be one LORD,
c63984	and his name one.
c63985	All the land shall be turned as a plain from Geba to Rimmon south of Jerusalem:
c63986	and it shall be lifted up,
c63987	and inhabited in her place,
c63988	from Benjamin's gate unto the place of the first gate, unto the corner gate,
c63989	and <i>from</i> the tower of Hananeel unto the king's winepresses.
c63990	And <i>men</i> shall dwell
c63991	in it, and there shall be no more utter destruction;
c63992	but Jerusalem shall be safely inhabited.
c63993	And this shall be the plague
c63994	wherewith the LORD will smite all the people
c63995	that have fought against Jerusalem;
c63996	Their flesh shall consume away
c63997	while they stand upon their feet,
c63998	and their eyes shall consume away in their holes,
c63999	and their tongue shall consume away in their mouth.
c64000	And it shall come to pass
c64001	in that day, <i>that</i> a great tumult from the LORD shall be
c64002	among them; and they shall lay hold every one on the hand of his neighbour,
c64003	and his hand shall rise up against the hand of his neighbour.
c64004	And Judah also shall fight at Jerusalem;
c64005	and the wealth of all the heathen round about shall be gathered together,
c64006	gold, and silver, and apparel, in great abundance.
c64007	And so shall be the plague of the horse, of the mule, of the camel, and of the ass, and of all the beasts
c64008	that shall be in these tents,
c64009	as this plague.
c64010	And it shall come to pass,
c64011	<i>that</i> every one
c64012	that is left of all the nations
c64013	which came against Jerusalem
c64014	shall even go up from year to year
c64015	to worship the King, the LORD of hosts,
c64016	and to keep the feast of tabernacles.
c64017	And it shall be,
c64018	<i>that</i> whoso will not come up of <i>all</i> the families of the earth unto Jerusalem
c64019	to worship the King, the LORD of hosts,
c64020	even upon them shall be no rain.
c64021	And if the family of Egypt go not up,
c64022	and come not,
c64023	that <i>have</i> no <i>rain;</i> there shall be the plague,
c64024	wherewith the LORD will smite the heathen
c64025	that come not up
c64026	to keep the feast of tabernacles.
c64027	This shall be the punishment of Egypt, and the punishment of all nations
c64028	that come not up
c64029	to keep the feast of tabernacles.
c64030	In that day shall there be upon the bells of the horses,
c64031	HOLINESS UNTO THE LORD;
c64032	and the pots in the LORD'S house shall be like the bowls before the altar.
c64033	Yea, every pot in Jerusalem and in Judah shall be holiness unto the LORD of hosts:
c64034	and all they that sacrifice shall come
c64035	and take of
c64036	them, and seethe
c64037	therein: and in that day there shall be no more the Canaanite in the house of the LORD of hosts.
c64038	The burden
c64039	of the word of the LORD to Israel by Malachi.
c64040	I have loved
c64041	you, saith the LORD.
c64042	Yet ye say,
c64043	Wherein hast thou loved
c64044	us? <i>Was</i> not Esau Jacob's brother?
c64045	saith the LORD:
c64046	yet I loved Jacob,
c64047	And I hated Esau,
c64048	and laid his mountains and his heritage waste
c64049	for the dragons of the wilderness.
c64050	Whereas Edom saith,
c64051	We are impoverished,
c64052	but we will return
c64053	and build the desolate places;
c64054	thus saith the LORD of hosts,
c64055	They shall build,
c64056	but I will throw down;
c64057	and they shall call them, The border of wickedness,
c64058	and, The people
c64059	against whom the LORD hath indignation for ever.
c64060	And your eyes shall see,
c64061	and ye shall say,
c64062	The LORD will be magnified from the border of Israel.
c64063	A son honoureth <i>his</i> father,
c64064	and a servant his master:
c64066	if then I <i>be</i> a father,
c64067	where <i>is</i> mine honour?
c64069	and if I <i>be</i> a master,
c64070	where <i>is</i> my fear?
c64071	saith the LORD of hosts
c64072	unto you, O priests,
c64073	that despise my name.
c64074	And ye say,
c64075	Wherein have we despised thy name?
c64076	Ye offer polluted bread upon mine altar;
c64077	and ye say,
c64078	Wherein have we polluted
c64079	thee? In that ye say,
c64080	The table of the LORD
c64081	<i>is</i> contemptible.
c64083	And if ye offer the blind
c64084	for sacrifice,
c64085	<i>is it</i> not evil?
c64087	and if ye offer the lame and sick,
c64088	<i>is it</i> not evil?
c64089	offer it now unto thy governor;
c64090	will he be pleased
c64091	with thee, or accept thy person?
c64092	saith the LORD of hosts.
c64093	And now,
c64094	I pray you, beseech God that he will be gracious
c64096	unto us: this hath been by your means:
c64097	will he regard your persons?
c64098	saith the LORD of hosts.
c64099	Who <i>is there</i> even
c64100	among you that would shut the doors
c64101	<i>for nought?</i> neither do ye kindle <i>fire</i> on mine altar for nought.
c64102	I have no pleasure
c64103	in you, saith the LORD of hosts,
c64104	neither will I accept an offering at your hand.
c64105	For from the rising of the sun even unto the going down of the same my name <i>shall be</i> great among the Gentiles;
c64106	and in every place incense <i>shall be</i> offered unto my name, and a pure offering:
c64107	for my name <i>shall be</i> great among the heathen,
c64108	saith the LORD of hosts.
c64109	But ye have profaned
c64110	it, in that ye say,
c64111	The table of the LORD
c64112	<i>is</i> polluted;
c64113	and the fruit
c64114	thereof, <i>even</i> his meat, <i>is</i> contemptible.
c64115	Ye said
c64116	also, Behold, what a weariness
c64117	<i>is it!</i> and ye have snuffed at
c64118	it, saith the LORD of hosts;
c64119	and ye brought <i>that which was</i> torn, and the lame, and the sick;
c64120	thus ye brought an offering:
c64121	should I accept this of your hand?
c64122	saith the LORD.
c64123	But cursed <i>be</i> the deceiver,
c64124	which hath in his flock a male,
c64125	and voweth,
c64126	and sacrificeth unto the Lord a corrupt thing:
c64127	for I <i>am</i> a great King,
c64128	saith the LORD of hosts,
c64129	and my name <i>is</i> dreadful among the heathen.
c64130	And now, O ye priests, this commandment <i>is</i> for you.
c64132	If ye will not hear,
c64133	and if ye will not lay <i>it</i> to heart,
c64134	to give glory unto my name,
c64135	saith the LORD of hosts,
c64136	I will even send a curse
c64137	upon you, and I will curse your blessings:
c64138	yea, I have cursed
c64139	them already, because ye do not lay <i>it</i> to heart.
c64140	Behold, I will corrupt your seed,
c64141	and spread dung upon your faces, <i>even</i> the dung of your solemn feasts;
c64142	and <i>one</i> shall take you away with it.
c64143	And ye shall know
c64144	that I have sent this commandment unto
c64145	you, that my covenant might be with Levi,
c64146	saith the LORD of hosts.
c64147	My covenant was with him of life and peace;
c64148	and I gave them to him <i>for</i> the fear
c64149	wherewith he feared
c64150	me, and was afraid before my name.
c64151	The law of truth was in his mouth,
c64152	and iniquity was not found in his lips:
c64153	he walked with me in peace and equity,
c64154	and did turn many away from iniquity.
c64155	For the priest's lips should keep knowledge,
c64156	and they should seek the law at his mouth:
c64157	for he <i>is</i> the messenger of the LORD of hosts.
c64158	But ye are departed out of the way;
c64159	ye have caused many to stumble at the law;
c64160	ye have corrupted the covenant of Levi,
c64161	saith the LORD of hosts.
c64162	Therefore have I also made you contemptible and base before all the people,
c64163	according as ye have not kept my ways,
c64164	but have been partial in the law.
c64165	Have we not all one father?
c64166	hath not one God created
c64167	us? why do we deal treacherously
c64168	every man against his brother,
c64169	by profaning the covenant of our fathers?
c64170	Judah hath dealt treacherously,
c64171	and an abomination is committed in Israel and in Jerusalem;
c64172	for Judah hath profaned the holiness of the LORD
c64173	which he loved,
c64174	and hath married the daughter of a strange god.
c64175	The LORD will cut off the man
c64176	that doeth
c64177	this, the master and the scholar, out of the tabernacles of Jacob,
c64178	and him that offereth an offering unto the LORD of hosts.
c64179	And this have ye done again,
c64180	covering the altar of the LORD with tears, with weeping, and with crying out,
c64181	insomuch that he regardeth not the offering any more,
c64182	or receiveth <i>it</i> with good will at your hand.
c64183	Yet ye say,
c64184	Wherefore?
c64185	Because the LORD hath been witness between thee and the wife of thy youth,
c64186	against whom thou hast dealt treacherously:
c64187	yet <i>is</i> she thy companion, and the wife of thy covenant.
c64188	And did not he make one?
c64189	Yet had he the residue of the spirit.
c64190	And wherefore one? That he might seek
c64191	a godly seed.
c64192	Therefore take heed to your spirit,
c64193	and let none deal treacherously against the wife of his youth.
c64194	For the LORD, the God of Israel, saith that he hateth
c64195	putting away:
c64197	for <i>one</i> covereth violence with his garment,
c64198	saith the LORD of hosts:
c64199	therefore take heed to your spirit,
c64200	that ye deal not treacherously.
c64201	Ye have wearied the LORD with your words.
c64202	Yet ye say,
c64203	Wherein have we wearied
c64204	<i>him?</i> When ye say,
c64205	Every one that doeth evil <i>is</i> good in the sight of the LORD,
c64206	and he delighteth
c64207	in them; or,
c64208	Where <i>is</i> the God of judgment?
c64209	in: behold, he shall come,
c64210	and he shall prepare the way before
c64211	me: and the Lord, whom ye seek, shall suddenly come to his temple,
c64213	even the messenger of the covenant,
c64214	whom ye delight
c64215	Behold, I will send my messenger,
c64216	saith the LORD of hosts.
c64217	But who may abide the day
c64218	of his coming?
c64219	and who
c64220	shall stand
c64221	when he appeareth?
c64222	for he <i>is</i> like a refiner's fire, and like fullers' soap:
c64223	And he shall sit
c64224	<i>as</i> a refiner
c64225	and purifier of silver:
c64226	and he shall purify the sons of Levi,
c64227	and purge them as gold and silver,
c64228	that they may offer unto the LORD an offering in righteousness.
c64229	Then shall the offering of Judah and Jerusalem be pleasant unto the LORD, as in the days of old, and as in former years.
c64230	And I will come near to you to judgment;
c64231	and I will be a swift witness against the sorcerers, and against the adulterers, and against false swearers,
c64232	and against those that oppress the hireling in <i>his</i> wages, the widow, and the fatherless,
c64233	and that turn aside the stranger
c64234	<i>from his right,</i> and fear not
c64235	me, saith the LORD of hosts.
c64236	For I <i>am</i> the LORD, I change not;
c64237	therefore ye
c64238	sons of Jacob
c64239	are not consumed.
c64240	Even from the days of your fathers ye are gone away from mine ordinances,
c64241	and have not kept
c64242	<i>them.</i> Return unto
c64243	me, and I will return unto
c64244	you, saith the LORD of hosts.
c64245	But ye said,
c64246	Wherein shall we return?
c64247	Will a man rob God?
c64248	Yet ye have robbed
c64249	me. But ye say,
c64250	Wherein have we robbed
c64251	thee? In tithes and offerings.
c64252	Ye <i>are</i> cursed with a curse:
c64253	for ye have robbed
c64254	me, <i>even</i> this whole nation.
c64255	Bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse,
c64256	that there may be meat in mine house,
c64257	and prove me now herewith,
c64258	saith the LORD of hosts,
c64259	if I will not open you the windows of heaven,
c64260	and pour you out a blessing, that <i>there shall</i> not <i>be room</i> enough <i>to receive it.</i>
c64261	And I will rebuke the devourer
c64262	for your sakes, and he shall not destroy the fruits of your ground;
c64263	neither shall your vine cast her fruit before the time in the field,
c64264	saith the LORD of hosts.
c64265	And all nations shall call you blessed:
c64266	for ye shall be a delightsome land,
c64267	saith the LORD of hosts.
c64268	Your words have been stout against
c64269	me, saith the LORD.
c64270	Yet ye say,
c64271	What have we spoken <i>so much</i> against thee?
c64272	Ye have said,
c64273	It <i>is</i> vain
c64274	to serve God:
c64275	and what profit
c64276	<i>is it</i> that we have kept his ordinance,
c64277	and that we have walked mournfully before the LORD of hosts?
c64278	And now
c64279	we call the proud happy;
c64280	yea, they that work wickedness are set up;
c64281	yea, <i>they that</i> tempt God
c64282	are even delivered.
c64283	Then they that feared the LORD spake often one to another:
c64285	and the LORD hearkened,
c64286	and heard
c64287	<i>it,</i> and a book of remembrance was written before him for them that feared the LORD, and that thought upon his name.
c64288	And they shall be
c64289	mine, saith the LORD of hosts,
c64290	in that day
c64291	when I make up
c64292	my jewels;
c64293	and I will spare
c64294	them, as a man spareth his own son
c64295	that serveth him.
c64296	Then shall ye return,
c64297	and discern between the righteous and the wicked,
c64298	between him that serveth God
c64299	and him that serveth him not.
c64300	For, behold, the day cometh,
c64301	that shall burn as an oven;
c64302	and all the proud, yea, and all that do wickedly, shall be stubble:
c64303	and the day that cometh shall burn them up,
c64304	saith the LORD of hosts,
c64305	that it shall leave them neither root nor branch.
c64306	But unto you that fear my name shall the Sun of righteousness arise
c64307	with healing in his wings;
c64308	and ye shall go forth,
c64309	and grow up as calves of the stall.
c64310	And ye shall tread down the wicked;
c64311	for they shall be ashes under the soles of your feet in the day
c64312	that I shall do
c64313	<i>this,</i> saith the LORD of hosts.
c64314	Remember ye the law of Moses my servant,
c64315	which I commanded unto him in Horeb for all Israel,
c64316	<i>with</i> the statutes and judgments.
c64317	Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet
c64318	before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the LORD:
c64319	And he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children,
c64320	and the heart of the children to their fathers,
c64321	lest I come
c64322	and smite the earth with a curse.
c64323	Blessed <i>is</i> the man
c64324	that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly,
c64325	nor standeth in the way of sinners,
c64326	nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful.
c64327	But his delight <i>is</i> in the law of the LORD;
c64328	and in his law doth he meditate day and night.
c64329	And he shall be like a tree
c64330	planted by the rivers of water,
c64331	that bringeth forth his fruit in his season;
c64332	his leaf also shall not wither;
c64333	and whatsoever
c64334	he doeth
c64335	shall prosper.
c64336	The ungodly <i>are</i> not so:
c64337	but <i>are</i> like the chaff
c64338	which the wind driveth away.
c64339	Therefore the ungodly shall not stand in the judgment,
c64340	nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous.
c64341	For the LORD knoweth the way of the righteous:
c64342	but the way of the ungodly shall perish.
c64343	Why do the heathen rage,
c64344	and the people imagine a vain thing?
c64345	The kings of the earth set themselves,
c64346	and the rulers take counsel together, against the LORD, and against his anointed, <i>saying,</i>
c64347	Let us break their bands asunder,
c64348	and cast away their cords from us.
c64349	He that sitteth in the heavens
c64350	shall laugh:
c64351	the Lord shall have them in derision.
c64352	Then shall he speak unto them in his wrath,
c64353	and vex them in his sore displeasure.
c64354	Yet have I set my king upon my holy hill of Zion.
c64355	I will declare the decree: the LORD
c64356	hath said unto
c64357	me, Thou <i>art</i> my Son;
c64358	this day have I begotten thee.
c64359	Ask of
c64360	me, and I shall give <i>thee</i> the heathen <i>for</i> thine inheritance,
c64361	and the uttermost parts of the earth <i>for</i> thy possession.
c64362	Thou shalt break them with a rod of iron;
c64363	thou shalt dash them in pieces like a potter's vessel.
c64364	now
c64365	therefore, O ye kings:
c64366	Be wise
c64367	be instructed,
c64368	ye judges of the earth.
c64369	Serve the LORD with fear,
c64370	and rejoice with trembling.
c64371	Kiss the Son,
c64372	lest he be angry,
c64373	and ye perish <i>from</i> the way,
c64374	when his wrath is kindled but a little.
c64375	Blessed <i>are</i> all
c64376	they that put their trust in him.

c64390	I cried unto the LORD with my voice,

c64392	Selah.
c64393	I laid me down

c64396	for the LORD sustained me.
c64397	I will not be afraid of ten thousands of people,

c64461	The foolish shall not stand in thy sight:
c64462	thou hatest all workers of iniquity.
c64463	Thou shalt destroy them that speak leasing:
c64464	the LORD will abhor the bloody and deceitful man.
c64465	But as for me, I will come <i>into</i> thy house in the multitude of thy mercy:
c64466	<i>and</i> in thy fear will I worship toward thy holy temple.
c64468	Lead me, O LORD, in thy righteousness because of mine enemies;
c64469	make thy way straight before my face.
c64470	For <i>there is</i> no faithfulness in their mouth;
c64471	their inward part <i>is</i> very wickedness;
c64472	their throat <i>is</i> an open sepulchre;

c64474	Destroy
c64475	thou them, O God;
c64476	let them fall by their own counsels;
c64477	cast them out in the multitude of their transgressions;
c64478	for they have rebelled against thee.
c64479	But let all those that put their trust in thee rejoice:
c64481	let them ever shout for joy,
c64482	because thou defendest them:
c64483	let them also that love thy name be joyful in thee.
c64484	For thou, LORD, wilt bless the righteous;
c64486	with favour wilt thou compass him as <i>with</i> a shield.

c64955	<b>To the chief Musician,</b>
c64956	<b><i>A Psalm</i> of David,</b> <b>the servant</b> <b>of the LORD,</b>
c64957	<b>who</b> <b>spake</b> <b>unto the LORD</b> <b>the words</b> <b>of this</b> <b>song</b> <b>in the day</b>
c64958	<b><i>that</i> the LORD</b> <b>delivered</b> <b>him from the hand</b> <b>of all</b> <b>his enemies,</b> <b>and from the hand</b> <b>of Saul:</b>
c64959	<b>And he said,</b>
c64960	I will love
c64961	thee, O LORD, my strength.
c64962	The LORD <i>is</i> my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer;
c64963	my God, my strength,
c64964	in whom I will trust;
c64965	my buckler, and the horn of my salvation, <i>and</i> my high tower.
c64966	I will call upon the LORD, <i>who is worthy</i> to be praised:
c64967	so shall I be saved from mine enemies.
c64968	The sorrows of death compassed
c64969	me, and the floods of ungodly men made me afraid.
c64970	The sorrows of hell compassed me about:
c64971	the snares of death prevented me.
c64972	In my distress I called upon the LORD,
c64973	and cried unto my God:
c64974	he heard my voice out of his temple,
c64975	and my cry came before him, <i>even</i> into his ears.
c64977	Then the earth shook and trembled;
c64978	the foundations also of the hills moved
c64979	and were shaken,
c64980	because he was wroth.
c64981	There went up a smoke out of his nostrils,
c64982	and fire out of his mouth devoured:
c64983	coals were kindled by it.
c64984	He bowed the heavens
c64985	also, and came down:
c64986	and darkness <i>was</i> under his feet.
c64987	And he rode upon a cherub,
c64988	and did fly:
c64989	yea, he did fly upon the wings of the wind.
c64990	He made darkness his secret place; his pavilion round about him <i>were</i> dark
c64991	waters <i>and</i> thick clouds of the skies.
c64992	At the brightness <i>that was</i> before him his thick clouds passed,
c64993	hail <i>stones</i> and coals of fire.
c64994	The LORD also thundered in the heavens,
c64995	and the Highest gave his voice;
c64996	hail <i>stones</i> and coals of fire.
c64997	Yea, he sent out his arrows,
c64998	and scattered
c64999	them; and he shot out lightnings,
c65000	and discomfited them.
c65001	Then the channels of waters were seen,
c65002	and the foundations of the world were discovered at thy rebuke,
c65003	O LORD,
c65004	at the blast of the breath of thy nostrils.
c65005	He sent from above,
c65006	he took
c65007	me, he drew me out of many waters.
c65008	He delivered me from my strong enemy, and from them which hated
c65009	me: for they were too strong for me.
c65010	They prevented me in the day of my calamity:
c65011	but the LORD was my stay.
c65012	He brought me forth also into a large place;
c65013	he delivered
c65014	me, because he delighted in me.
c65015	The LORD rewarded me according to my righteousness;
c65016	according to the cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me.
c65017	For I have kept the ways of the LORD,
c65018	and have not wickedly departed from my God.
c65019	For all his judgments <i>were</i> before
c65020	me, and I did not put away his statutes from me.
c65021	I was also upright before
c65022	him, and I kept myself from mine iniquity.
c65023	Therefore hath the LORD recompensed me according to my righteousness,
c65024	according to the cleanness of my hands in his eyesight.
c65025	With the merciful thou wilt shew thyself merciful;
c65026	with an upright man thou wilt shew thyself upright;
c65027	With the pure thou wilt shew thyself pure;
c65028	and with the froward thou wilt shew thyself froward.
c65029	For thou wilt save the afflicted people;
c65030	but wilt bring down high looks.
c65031	For thou wilt light my candle:
c65032	the LORD my God will enlighten my darkness.
c65033	For by thee I have run through a troop;
c65034	and by my God have I leaped over a wall.
c65035	<i>As for</i> God,
c65036	his way <i>is</i> perfect:
c65037	the word of the LORD is tried:
c65038	he <i>is</i> a buckler to all
c65039	those that trust in him.
c65040	For who <i>is</i> God save the LORD?
c65041	or who <i>is</i> a rock save our God?
c65042	<i>It is</i> God
c65043	that girdeth me with strength,
c65044	and maketh my way perfect.
c65045	He maketh my feet like hinds'
c65046	<i>feet,</i> and setteth me upon my high places.
c65047	He teacheth my hands to war,
c65048	so that a bow of steel is broken by mine arms.
c65049	Thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation:
c65050	and thy right hand hath holden me up,
c65051	and thy gentleness hath made me great.
c65052	Thou hast enlarged my steps under
c65053	me, that my feet did not slip.
c65054	I have pursued mine enemies,
c65055	and overtaken
c65056	them: neither did I turn again
c65057	till they were consumed.
c65058	I have wounded
c65059	them that they were not able
c65060	to rise:
c65061	they are fallen under my feet.
c65062	For thou hast girded me with strength unto the battle:
c65063	thou hast subdued under me those that rose up against me.
c65064	of mine enemies;
c65065	Thou hast also given me the necks
c65066	them that hate me.
c65067	that I might destroy
c65068	They cried,
c65069	but <i>there was</i> none to save
c65070	<i>them: even</i> unto the LORD,
c65071	but he answered them not.
c65072	Then did I beat them small as the dust before the wind:
c65073	I did cast them out as the dirt in the streets.
c65074	Thou hast delivered me from the strivings of the people;
c65075	<i>and</i> thou hast made me the head of the heathen:
c65076	a people
c65077	<i>whom</i> I have not known
c65078	shall serve me.
c65079	As soon as they hear of me, they shall obey
c65080	me: the strangers shall submit themselves unto me.
c65081	The strangers shall fade away,
c65082	and be afraid out of their close places.
c65083	The LORD liveth;
c65084	and blessed <i>be</i> my rock;
c65085	and let the God of my salvation be exalted.
c65086	<i>It is</i> God
c65087	that avengeth
c65088	me, and subdueth the people under me.
c65089	He delivereth me from mine enemies:
c65090	yea, thou liftest me up above those that rise up
c65091	against me: thou hast delivered me from the violent man.
c65092	Therefore will I give thanks unto thee, O LORD, among the heathen,
c65094	and sing praises unto thy name.
c65095	Great deliverance giveth he to his king;
c65096	and sheweth mercy to his anointed, to David, and to his seed for evermore.
c65097	<b>To the chief Musician,</b>

c65099	The heavens declare the glory of God;
c65100	and the firmament sheweth his handywork.
c65101	Day unto day uttereth speech,
c65102	and night unto night sheweth knowledge.
c65103	<i>There is</i> no speech

c65109	Which <i>is</i> as a bridegroom

c65124	The fear of the LORD <i>is</i> clean,
c65125	enduring for ever:

c65127	<i>and</i> righteous altogether.
c65128	More to be desired <i>are they</i> than gold, yea, than much fine gold:

c65130	Moreover by them is thy servant warned:

c65135	Keep back thy servant also from presumptuous
c65136	<i>sins;</i> let them not have dominion

c65138	and I shall be innocent from the great transgression.
c65139	Let the words of my mouth, and the meditation of my heart, be acceptable in thy sight,

c65175	Thou hast given him his heart's desire,

c65184	For thou hast made him most blessed for ever:
c65185	thou hast made him exceeding glad with thy countenance.
c65186	For the king trusteth in the LORD,
c65187	and through the mercy of the most High he shall not be moved.
c65188	Thine hand shall find out all thine enemies:

c65211	O my God,
c65212	I cry in the daytime,
c65213	but thou hearest not;
c65214	and in the night season,
c65215	and am not silent.
c65216	But thou <i>art</i> holy,
c65217	<i>O thou</i> that inhabitest the praises of Israel.
c65218	Our fathers trusted

c65221	They cried unto

c65223	they trusted
c65224	in thee, and were not confounded.
c65225	But I <i>am</i> a worm,

c65227	a reproach of men,

c65235	<i>that</i> he would deliver
c65236	him: let him deliver
c65237	him, seeing he delighted in him.
c65238	But thou <i>art</i> he that took me out of the womb:

c65259	me: they pierced my hands and my feet.
c65260	I may tell all my bones:

c65431	<b><i>A Psalm</i> of David.</b>
c65432	Judge
c65433	me, O LORD;
c65434	for I have walked in mine integrity:
c65435	I have trusted also in the LORD;
c65436	<i>therefore</i> I shall not slide.
c65437	Examine
c65438	me, O LORD,
c65439	and prove
c65440	me; try my reins and my heart.
c65441	For thy lovingkindness <i>is</i> before mine eyes:
c65442	and I have walked in thy truth.
c65443	I have not sat with vain persons,
c65444	neither will I go in with dissemblers.
c65445	I have hated the congregation of evil doers;
c65446	and will not sit with the wicked.
c65447	I will wash mine hands in innocency:
c65448	so will I compass thine altar,
c65449	O LORD:
c65450	That I may publish with the voice of thanksgiving,
c65451	and tell of all thy wondrous works.
c65452	LORD,
c65453	I have loved the habitation of thy house, and the place where thine honour dwelleth.
c65454	Gather not my soul with sinners,
c65455	nor my life with bloody men:
c65456	In whose hands <i>is</i> mischief,
c65457	and their right hand is full of bribes.
c65458	But as for me, I will walk in mine integrity:
c65459	redeem
c65460	me, and be merciful unto me.
c65461	My foot standeth in an even place:
c65462	in the congregations will I bless the LORD.
c65463	<b><i>A Psalm</i> of David.</b>
c65464	The LORD <i>is</i> my light and my salvation;
c65465	whom shall I fear?
c65466	the LORD <i>is</i> the strength of my life;
c65467	of whom shall I be afraid?
c65468	When the wicked, <i>even</i> mine enemies and my foes, came upon
c65469	me to eat up my flesh,
c65471	they stumbled
c65472	and fell.
c65473	Though an host should encamp against
c65474	me, my heart shall not fear:
c65475	though war should rise against
c65476	me, in this <i>will</i> I <i>be</i> confident.
c65477	One <i>thing</i> have I desired of the LORD,
c65478	that will I seek after;
c65479	that I may dwell in the house of the LORD all the days of my life,
c65480	to behold the beauty of the LORD,
c65481	and to enquire in his temple.
c65482	For in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his pavilion:
c65483	in the secret of his tabernacle shall he hide
c65484	me; he shall set me up upon a rock.
c65485	And now shall mine head be lifted up above mine enemies round about
c65486	me: therefore will I offer in his tabernacle sacrifices of joy;
c65487	I will sing,
c65488	yea, I will sing praises unto the LORD.
c65489	Hear,
c65490	O LORD,
c65491	<i>when</i> I cry with my voice:
c65492	have mercy
c65493	also upon me, and answer me.
c65494	my heart said
c65495	<i>When thou saidst,</i> Seek ye my face;
c65496	unto thee, Thy face,
c65497	LORD,
c65498	will I seek.
c65499	Hide not thy face <i>far</i> from
c65500	me; put not thy servant away in anger:
c65501	thou hast been my help;
c65502	leave me not,
c65503	neither forsake
c65504	me, O God of my salvation.
c65505	When my father and my mother forsake
c65506	me, then the LORD will take me up.
c65507	Teach
c65508	O LORD,
c65509	me thy way,
c65510	and lead me in a plain path, because of mine enemies.
c65511	Deliver me not over unto the will of mine enemies:
c65512	for false witnesses are risen up against me, and such as breathe out cruelty.
c65513	<i>I had fainted,</i> unless I had believed
c65514	to see the goodness of the LORD in the land of the living.
c65515	Wait on the LORD:
c65516	be of good courage,
c65517	and he shall strengthen thine heart:
c65518	wait, I say, on the LORD.
c65519	<b><i>A Psalm</i> of David.</b>
c65520	Unto
c65521	O LORD
c65522	thee will I cry,
c65523	my rock;
c65524	be not silent to
c65525	me: lest, <i>if</i> thou be silent to
c65526	me, I become like
c65527	them that go down into the pit.
c65528	Hear the voice of my supplications,
c65529	when I cry unto
c65530	thee, when I lift up my hands toward thy holy oracle.
c65531	Draw me not away with the wicked, and with the workers of iniquity,
c65532	which speak peace to their neighbours,
c65533	but mischief <i>is</i> in their hearts.
c65534	Give them according to their deeds, and according to the wickedness of their endeavours:
c65535	give them after the work of their hands;
c65536	render to them their desert.
c65537	Because they regard not the works of the LORD, nor the operation of his hands,
c65538	he shall destroy
c65539	them, and not build them up.
c65540	Blessed <i>be</i> the LORD,
c65541	because he hath heard the voice of my supplications.
c65542	The LORD <i>is</i> my strength and my shield;
c65543	my heart trusted
c65544	in him, and I am helped:
c65545	therefore my heart greatly rejoiceth;
c65546	and with my song will I praise him.
c65547	The LORD <i>is</i> their strength,
c65548	and he <i>is</i> the saving strength of his anointed.
c65549	Save thy people,
c65550	and bless thine inheritance:
c65551	feed
c65552	them also, and lift them up for ever.
c65553	<b>A Psalm</b> <b>of David.</b>
c65554	Give unto the LORD,
c65555	O ye mighty,
c65556	give unto the LORD glory and strength.
c65557	Give unto the LORD the glory due unto his name;
c65558	worship the LORD in the beauty of holiness.
c65559	The voice of the LORD <i>is</i> upon the waters:
c65560	the God of glory thundereth:
c65561	the LORD <i>is</i> upon many waters.
c65562	The voice of the LORD <i>is</i> powerful;
c65563	the voice of the LORD <i>is</i> full of majesty.
c65564	The voice of the LORD breaketh the cedars;
c65565	yea, the LORD breaketh the cedars of Lebanon.
c65566	He maketh them also to skip like a calf;
c65567	Lebanon and Sirion like a young unicorn.
c65568	The voice of the LORD divideth the flames of fire.
c65569	The voice of the LORD shaketh the wilderness;
c65570	the LORD shaketh the wilderness of Kadesh.
c65571	The voice of the LORD maketh the hinds to calve,
c65572	and discovereth the forests:
c65573	and in his temple doth every one speak of <i>his</i> glory.
c65574	The LORD sitteth upon the flood;
c65575	yea, the LORD sitteth King for ever.
c65576	The LORD will give strength unto his people;
c65577	the LORD will bless his people with peace.
c65578	<b>A Psalm</b> <b><i>and</i> Song</b> <b><i>at</i> the dedication</b> <b>of the house</b>
c65579	<b>of David.</b>
c65580	I will extol
c65581	thee, O LORD;
c65582	for thou hast lifted me up,
c65583	and hast not made my foes to rejoice over me.
c65584	O LORD my God,
c65585	I cried unto
c65586	thee, and thou hast healed me.
c65587	O LORD,
c65588	thou hast brought up my soul from the grave:
c65589	thou hast kept me alive,
c65590	that I should not go down to the pit.
c65591	Sing unto the LORD,
c65592	O ye saints
c65593	of his, and give thanks at the remembrance of his holiness.
c65594	For his anger <i>endureth but</i> a moment;
c65595	in his favour <i>is</i> life:
c65596	weeping may endure for a night,
c65597	but joy <i>cometh</i> in the morning.
c65598	And in my prosperity I said,
c65599	I shall never be moved.
c65600	LORD,
c65601	by thy favour thou hast made my mountain to stand strong:
c65602	thou didst hide thy face,
c65603	<i>and</i> I was troubled.
c65604	to
c65605	thee, O LORD;
c65606	I cried
c65607	and unto the LORD I made supplication.
c65608	What profit <i>is there</i> in my blood,
c65609	when I go down to the pit?
c65610	Shall the dust praise
c65611	thee? shall it declare thy truth?
c65612	Hear,
c65613	O LORD,
c65614	and have mercy
c65615	upon me: LORD,
c65616	be thou my helper.
c65617	Thou hast turned for me my mourning into dancing:
c65618	thou hast put off my sackcloth,
c65619	and girded me with gladness;
c65620	To the end that <i>my</i> glory may sing praise
c65621	to thee, and not be silent.
c65622	O LORD my God,
c65623	I will give thanks unto thee for ever.
c65624	<b>To the chief Musician,</b>
c65625	<b>A Psalm</b> <b>of David.</b>
c65627	In thee, O LORD,
c65628	do I put my trust;
c65629	let me never be ashamed:
c65630	deliver me in thy righteousness.
c65631	Bow down thine ear to
c65632	me; deliver me speedily:
c65633	be thou my strong rock,
c65634	for an house of defence
c65635	to save me.
c65636	For thou <i>art</i> my rock and my fortress;
c65637	therefore for thy name's sake lead
c65638	me, and guide me.
c65639	Pull me out of the net
c65640	that they have laid privily
c65641	for me: for thou <i>art</i> my strength.
c65642	Into thine hand I commit my spirit:
c65643	thou hast redeemed
c65644	me, O LORD God of truth.
c65645	I have hated
c65646	them that regard lying vanities:
c65647	but I trust in the LORD.
c65648	I will be glad
c65649	and rejoice in thy mercy:
c65650	for thou hast considered my trouble;
c65651	thou hast known my soul in adversities;
c65652	And hast not shut me up into the hand of the enemy:
c65653	thou hast set my feet in a large room.
c65654	Have mercy
c65655	upon me, O LORD,
c65656	for I am in trouble:
c65657	mine eye is consumed with grief, <i>yea,</i> my soul and my belly.
c65658	For my life is spent with grief,
c65659	and my years with sighing:
c65660	my strength faileth because of mine iniquity,
c65661	and my bones are consumed.
c65662	I was a reproach among all mine enemies,
c65663	but especially among my neighbours,
c65664	and a fear to mine acquaintance:
c65665	they that did see me without
c65666	fled from me.
c65667	I am forgotten as a dead man out of mind:
c65668	I am like a broken vessel.
c65669	For I have heard the slander of many:
c65670	fear <i>was</i> on every side:
c65671	while they took counsel together against
c65672	to take away my life.
c65673	me, they devised
c65674	But I trusted in
c65675	thee, O LORD:
c65676	I said,
c65677	Thou <i>art</i> my God.
c65678	My times <i>are</i> in thy hand:
c65679	deliver me from the hand of mine enemies, and from them that persecute me.
c65680	Make thy face to shine upon thy servant:
c65681	save me for thy mercies' sake.
c65682	O LORD;
c65683	Let me not be ashamed,
c65684	for I have called upon
c65685	thee: let the wicked be ashamed,
c65686	<i>and</i> let them be silent in the grave.
c65687	Let the lying lips be put to silence;
c65688	which speak grievous things proudly and contemptuously against the righteous.
c65689	<i>Oh</i> how great <i>is</i> thy goodness,
c65690	which thou hast laid up for them that fear
c65691	thee; <i>which</i> thou hast wrought
c65692	for them that trust
c65693	in thee before the sons of men!
c65694	Thou shalt hide them in the secret of thy presence from the pride of man:
c65695	thou shalt keep them secretly in a pavilion from the strife of tongues.
c65696	Blessed <i>be</i> the LORD:
c65697	for he hath shewed me his marvellous kindness in a strong city.
c65698	For I said in my haste,
c65699	I am cut off from before thine eyes:
c65700	nevertheless thou heardest the voice of my supplications
c65701	when I cried unto thee.
c65702	O love the LORD,
c65703	all ye his saints:
c65704	<i>for</i> the LORD preserveth the faithful,
c65705	and plentifully rewardeth the proud doer.
c65706	Be of good courage,
c65707	and he shall strengthen your heart,
c65708	all
c65709	ye that hope in the LORD.
c65710	<b><i>A Psalm</i> of David,</b>
c65711	<b>Maschil.</b>
c65712	Blessed <i>is he whose</i> transgression <i>is</i> forgiven, <i>whose</i> sin <i>is</i> covered.
c65713	Blessed <i>is</i> the man
c65714	unto whom the LORD imputeth not iniquity,
c65715	and in whose spirit <i>there is</i> no guile.
c65716	When I kept silence,
c65717	my bones waxed old through my roaring all the day long.
c65718	For day and night thy hand was heavy upon
c65719	me: my moisture is turned into the drought of summer.
c65720	Selah.
c65721	I acknowledged my sin
c65722	unto thee, and mine iniquity have I not hid.
c65723	I said,
c65724	I will confess my transgressions unto the LORD;
c65725	and thou forgavest the iniquity of my sin.
c65726	Selah.
c65727	For this shall every one that is godly pray unto thee in a time
c65728	when thou mayest be found:
c65729	surely in the floods of great waters they shall not come nigh unto him.
c65730	Thou <i>art</i> my hiding place;
c65731	thou shalt preserve me from trouble;
c65732	with songs
c65733	of deliverance.
c65734	thou shalt compass me about

c65736	I will instruct
c65737	thee and teach thee in the way
c65738	which thou shalt go:
c65739	I will guide thee with mine eye.
c65740	Be ye not as the horse,
c65741	<i>or</i> as the mule,
c65742	<i>which</i> have no understanding:
c65743	whose mouth must be held in with bit and bridle,
c65745	lest they come near unto thee.
c65746	Many sorrows <i>shall be</i> to the wicked:
c65747	but he that trusteth in the LORD,
c65748	mercy shall compass him about.
c65749	Be glad in the LORD,

c65754	Rejoice
c65755	O ye righteous:
c65756	in the LORD,
c65757	<i>for</i> praise is comely for the upright.
c65758	Praise the LORD with harp:
c65759	sing unto him with the psaltery <i>and</i> an instrument of ten strings.
c65760	Sing unto him a new song;
c65762	play skilfully with a loud noise.
c65763	For the word of the LORD <i>is</i> right;
c65764	and all his works <i>are done</i> in truth.
c65765	He loveth righteousness and judgment:
c65766	the earth is full of the goodness of the LORD.
c65767	By the word of the LORD were the heavens made;
c65768	and all the host of them by the breath of his mouth.
c65769	He gathereth the waters of the sea together as an heap:
c65770	he layeth up the depth in storehouses.
c65771	Let all the earth fear the LORD:
c65772	let all the inhabitants of the world stand in awe of him.
c65773	For he spake,
c65774	and it was
c65775	<i>done;</i> he commanded,
c65776	and it stood fast.
c65777	The LORD bringeth the counsel of the heathen to nought:
c65778	he maketh the devices of the people of none effect.
c65779	The counsel of the LORD standeth for ever,
c65780	the thoughts of his heart to all generations.
c65781	Blessed <i>is</i> the nation
c65782	whose God <i>is</i> the LORD;
c65783	<i>and</i> the people

c65785	The LORD looketh from heaven;
c65786	he beholdeth all the sons of men.
c65787	From the place of his habitation he looketh upon all the inhabitants of the earth.
c65788	He fashioneth their hearts alike;
c65789	he considereth all their works.
c65790	There is no king saved by the multitude of an host:
c65791	a mighty man is not delivered by much strength.
c65792	An horse <i>is</i> a vain thing for safety:
c65793	neither shall he deliver <i>any</i> by his great strength.

c65907	who <i>is</i> like unto thee,
c65908	which deliverest the poor from him that is too strong for
c65909	him, yea, the poor and the needy from him that spoileth him?
c65910	False witnesses did rise up;
c65911	<i>things</i> that I knew not.
c65912	they laid to my charge
c65913	They rewarded me evil for good <i>to</i> the spoiling of my soul.
c65914	But as for me,

c65919	I behaved myself as though <i>he had been</i> my friend <i>or</i> brother:
c65920	I bowed down heavily, as one that mourneth <i>for his</i> mother.
c65921	But in mine adversity they rejoiced,
c65922	and gathered themselves together:
c65923	<i>yea,</i> the abjects gathered themselves together against
c65924	me, and I knew <i>it</i> not;
c65925	they did tear
c65926	<i>me,</i> and ceased not:
c65927	With hypocritical mockers in feasts, they gnashed upon me with their teeth.
c65928	Lord,
c65929	how long wilt thou look on?
c65930	rescue my soul from their destructions,
c65931	my darling from the lions.
c65932	I will give thee thanks in the great congregation:
c65933	I will praise thee among much people.
c65934	Let not them that are mine enemies wrongfully rejoice
c65936	that hate me without a cause.
c65937	over me: <i>neither</i> let them wink with the eye
c65938	For they speak not peace:
c65939	but they devise deceitful matters against <i>them that are</i> quiet in the land.
c65940	Yea, they opened their mouth wide against
c65941	me, <i>and</i> said,
c65942	Aha, aha, our eye hath seen <i>it.</i>
c65943	<i>This</i> thou hast seen,

c65949	and awake to my judgment,
c65950	my God and my Lord.
c65951	<i>even</i> unto my cause,
c65952	Judge me, O LORD my God, according to thy righteousness;
c65954	and let them not rejoice over me.
c65955	Let them not say in their hearts,

c65961	let them be clothed with shame and dishonour
c65962	that magnify <i>themselves</i> against me.
c65963	Let them shout for joy,

c65966	Let the LORD be magnified,

c65970	<b>To the chief Musician,</b>

c65972	The transgression of the wicked saith within my heart,
c65973	<i>that there is</i> no fear of God before his eyes.
c65974	For he flattereth himself in his own eyes,
c65975	until his iniquity be found
c65976	to be hateful.
c65977	The words of his mouth <i>are</i> iniquity and deceit:
c65978	he hath left off
c65979	to be wise,
c65980	<i>and</i> to do good.
c65981	He deviseth mischief upon his bed;
c65982	he setteth himself in a way
c65983	<i>that is</i> not good;
c65984	he abhorreth not evil.
c65986	Thy mercy, O LORD, <i>is</i> in the heavens;
c65987	<i>and</i> thy faithfulness <i>reacheth</i> unto the clouds.
c65988	Thy righteousness <i>is</i> like the great mountains;
c65989	thy judgments <i>are</i> a great deep:
c65990	thou preservest man and beast.
c65991	O LORD,

c65994	therefore the children of men put their trust under the shadow of thy wings.
c65995	They shall be abundantly satisfied with the fatness of thy house;
c65996	and thou shalt make them drink of the river of thy pleasures.
c65997	For with thee <i>is</i> the fountain of life:
c65998	in thy light shall we see light.
c65999	O continue thy lovingkindness unto them that know
c66000	thee; and thy righteousness to the upright in heart.
c66001	Let not the foot of pride come against
c66002	me, and let not the hand of the wicked remove me.
c66003	There are the workers of iniquity fallen:
c66005	they are cast down,
c66006	and shall not be able
c66007	to rise.
c66008	<b><i>A Psalm</i> of David.</b>
c66009	Fret not thyself because of evildoers,
c66010	neither be thou envious
c66011	against the workers of iniquity.
c66012	For they shall soon be cut down like the grass,
c66013	and wither as the green herb.
c66014	Trust in the LORD,
c66015	and do good;
c66016	<i>so</i> shalt thou dwell in the land,
c66017	and verily thou shalt be fed.
c66018	Delight thyself also in the LORD;
c66019	and he shall give thee the desires of thine heart.
c66020	Commit thy way unto the LORD;
c66021	trust also in
c66022	him; and he shall bring <i>it</i> to pass.
c66023	And he shall bring forth thy righteousness as the light,
c66024	and thy judgment as the noonday.
c66025	Rest in the LORD,
c66026	and wait patiently
c66027	for him: fret not thyself
c66028	because of him who prospereth in his way,
c66029	because of the man
c66030	who bringeth wicked devices to pass.
c66031	Cease from anger,
c66032	and forsake wrath:
c66033	fret not thyself in any wise
c66034	to do evil.
c66035	For evildoers shall be cut off:

c66038	For yet a little
c66039	while, and the wicked <i>shall</i> not
c66040	<i>be:</i> yea, thou shalt diligently consider his place,
c66041	and it <i>shall</i> not <i>be.</i>
c66042	But the meek shall inherit the earth;
c66043	and shall delight themselves in the abundance of peace.
c66044	The wicked plotteth against the just,
c66045	and gnasheth upon him with his teeth.
c66046	The Lord shall laugh
c66047	at him: for he seeth
c66048	that his day is coming.
c66049	The wicked have drawn out the sword,
c66050	and have bent their bow,
c66051	to cast down the poor and needy,
c66052	<i>and</i> to slay such as be of upright conversation.
c66053	Their sword shall enter into their own heart,
c66054	and their bows shall be broken.
c66055	A little that a righteous man hath <i>is</i> better than the riches of many wicked.
c66056	For the arms of the wicked shall be broken:
c66057	but the LORD upholdeth the righteous.
c66058	The LORD knoweth the days of the upright:
c66059	and their inheritance shall be for ever.
c66060	They shall not be ashamed in the evil time:
c66061	and in the days of famine they shall be satisfied.
c66062	But the wicked shall perish,
c66063	and the enemies of the LORD <i>shall be</i> as the fat of lambs: they shall consume;
c66064	into smoke shall they consume away.
c66065	The wicked borroweth,
c66066	and payeth not
c66067	again: but the righteous sheweth mercy,
c66068	and giveth.
c66069	For <i>such as be</i> blessed of him shall inherit the earth;
c66070	and <i>they that be</i> cursed of him shall be cut off.
c66071	The steps of a <i>good</i> man are ordered by the LORD:
c66072	and he delighteth in his way.
c66073	Though he fall,
c66074	he shall not be utterly cast down:
c66075	for the LORD upholdeth <i>him with</i> his hand.
c66076	I have been young,
c66077	and <i>now</i> am old;

c66079	the righteous forsaken,
c66080	nor his seed begging bread.
c66081	<i>He is</i> ever merciful,
c66082	and lendeth;
c66083	and his seed <i>is</i> blessed.
c66084	Depart from evil,
c66085	and do good;
c66086	and dwell for evermore.
c66087	For the LORD loveth judgment,
c66088	and forsaketh not his saints;
c66089	they are preserved for ever:
c66090	but the seed of the wicked shall be cut off.
c66091	The righteous shall inherit the land,
c66092	and dwell therein for ever.
c66093	The mouth of the righteous speaketh wisdom,
c66094	and his tongue talketh of judgment.
c66095	The law of his God <i>is</i> in his heart;
c66096	none of his steps shall slide.
c66097	The wicked watcheth the righteous,
c66098	and seeketh
c66099	to slay him.
c66100	The LORD will not leave him in his hand,
c66101	nor condemn
c66102	him when he is judged.
c66103	Wait on the LORD,
c66104	and keep his way,
c66105	and he shall exalt
c66106	thee to inherit the land:
c66107	when the wicked are cut off,
c66108	thou shalt see <i>it.</i>
c66109	I have seen the wicked
c66110	in great power,
c66111	and spreading himself like a green bay tree.
c66112	Yet he passed away,
c66113	and, lo, he <i>was</i> not:
c66114	yea, I sought
c66115	him, but he could not be found.
c66116	Mark the perfect

c66118	for the end of <i>that</i> man <i>is</i> peace.
c66119	But the transgressors shall be destroyed together:
c66120	the end of the wicked shall be cut off.
c66121	But the salvation of the righteous <i>is</i> of the LORD:
c66122	<i>he is</i> their strength in the time of trouble.
c66123	And the LORD shall help
c66124	them, and deliver

c66128	<b>A Psalm</b> <b>of David,</b>

c66133	For thine arrows stick fast
c66134	in me, and thy hand presseth me sore.
c66135	<i>There is</i> no soundness in my flesh because of thine anger;
c66136	neither <i>is there any</i> rest in my bones because of my sin.
c66137	For mine iniquities are gone over mine head:
c66138	as an heavy burden they are too heavy for me.
c66140	My wounds stink <i>and</i> are corrupt because of my foolishness.
c66141	I am troubled;
c66142	I am bowed down greatly;
c66143	I go mourning all the day long.
c66144	For my loins are filled with a loathsome
c66145	<i>disease:</i> and <i>there is</i> no soundness in my flesh.
c66146	I am feeble
c66147	and sore broken:
c66148	I have roared by reason of the disquietness of my heart.
c66149	Lord,

c66152	My heart panteth,

c66161	<i>for me:</i> and they that seek my hurt

c66180	For I <i>am</i> ready to halt,

c66277	Sacrifice and offering thou didst not desire;

c66441	O God,
c66442	We have heard with our ears,
c66443	our fathers have told us, <i>what</i> work
c66444	thou didst in their days, in the times of old.
c66445	<i>How</i> thou didst drive out the heathen with thy hand,
c66446	and plantedst
c66447	them; <i>how</i> thou didst afflict the people,
c66448	and cast them out.
c66449	For they got not the land in possession by their own sword,
c66450	neither did their own arm save
c66451	them: but thy right hand, and thine arm, and the light of thy countenance,
c66452	because thou hadst a favour unto them.
c66453	Thou art my King,
c66454	O God:
c66455	command deliverances for Jacob.
c66456	Through thee will we push down our enemies:
c66457	through thy name will we tread them under
c66458	that rise up against us.
c66459	For I will not trust in my bow,
c66460	neither shall my sword save me.
c66461	But thou hast saved us from our enemies,
c66462	and hast put them to shame that hated us.
c66463	In God we boast all the day
c66464	long, and praise thy name for ever.
c66465	Selah.
c66466	But thou hast cast off,
c66467	and put us to shame;
c66468	and goest not forth with our armies.
c66469	Thou makest us to turn back from the enemy:
c66470	and they which hate us spoil for themselves.
c66471	Thou hast given us like sheep <i>appointed</i> for meat;
c66472	and hast scattered us among the heathen.
c66473	Thou sellest thy people for nought,
c66474	and dost not increase <i>thy wealth</i> by their price.
c66475	Thou makest us a reproach to our neighbours,
c66476	a scorn and a derision to them that are round about us.
c66477	Thou makest us a byword among the heathen,
c66478	a shaking of the head
c66479	among the people.
c66480	My confusion <i>is</i> continually before
c66481	me, and the shame of my face hath covered me,
c66482	For the voice of him that reproacheth and blasphemeth;
c66483	by reason of the enemy and avenger.
c66484	All this is come upon
c66485	us; yet have we not forgotten
c66486	thee, neither have we dealt falsely in thy covenant.
c66487	Our heart is not turned back,
c66488	neither have our steps declined from thy way;
c66489	Though thou hast sore broken us in the place of dragons,
c66490	and covered us with the shadow of death.
c66491	If we have forgotten the name of our God,
c66492	or stretched out our hands to a strange god;
c66493	Shall not God search this
c66494	out? for he knoweth the secrets of the heart.
c66495	Yea, for thy sake are we killed all the day
c66496	long; we are counted as sheep for the slaughter.

c66500	arise,
c66501	cast <i>us</i> not off for ever.
c66502	Wherefore hidest thou thy face,
c66503	<i>and</i> forgettest our affliction and our oppression?
c66504	For our soul is bowed down to the dust:
c66505	our belly cleaveth unto the earth.

c67382	preserve my life from fear of the enemy.
c67383	Hide me from the secret counsel of the wicked;

c67385	Who whet their tongue like a sword,

c67881	which thou hast redeemed.
c67882	My tongue also shall talk of thy righteousness all the day

c67886	<b><i>A Psalm</i> for Solomon.</b>
c67887	O God,
c67888	Give the king thy judgments,
c67889	and thy righteousness unto the king's son.
c67890	He shall judge thy people with righteousness,
c67891	and thy poor with judgment.
c67892	The mountains shall bring peace to the people,
c67893	and the little hills, by righteousness.
c67894	He shall judge the poor of the people,
c67895	he shall save the children of the needy,
c67896	and shall break in pieces the oppressor.
c67897	They shall fear thee as long as the sun and moon endure, throughout all generations.
c67898	He shall come down like rain upon the mown grass:
c67899	as showers <i>that</i> water the earth.
c67900	In his days shall the righteous flourish;
c67901	and abundance of peace so long as the moon endureth.
c67902	He shall have dominion also from sea to sea, and from the river unto the ends of the earth.
c67903	They that dwell in the wilderness shall bow before
c67904	him; and his enemies shall lick the dust.
c67905	The kings of Tarshish and of the isles shall bring presents:

c67907	Yea, all kings shall fall down

c67913	He shall spare the poor and needy,

c67915	He shall redeem their soul from deceit and violence:
c67916	and precious shall their blood be in his sight.
c67917	And he shall live,
c67918	and to him shall be given of the gold of Sheba:
c67919	prayer also shall be made for him continually;
c67920	<i>and</i> daily shall he be praised.
c67921	There shall be an handful of corn in the earth upon the top of the mountains;
c67922	the fruit thereof shall shake like Lebanon:

c67934	<b>A Psalm</b> <b>of Asaph.</b>
c67935	Truly God <i>is</i> good to Israel,
c67936	<i>even</i> to such as are of a clean heart.
c67937	But as for me,
c67938	my feet were almost gone;
c67939	my steps had well nigh slipped.
c67940	For I was envious at the foolish,
c67941	<i>when</i> I saw the prosperity of the wicked.
c67942	For <i>there are</i> no bands in their death:
c67943	but their strength <i>is</i> firm.
c67944	They <i>are</i> not in trouble <i>as other</i> men;
c67945	neither are they plagued like <i>other</i> men.
c67946	Therefore pride compasseth them about as a chain;
c67947	violence covereth them <i>as</i> a garment.
c67948	Their eyes stand out with fatness:
c67949	they have more than heart could wish.
c67950	They are corrupt,
c67951	and speak wickedly <i>concerning</i> oppression:
c67952	they speak loftily.
c67953	They set their mouth against the heavens,
c67954	and their tongue walketh through the earth.
c67955	Therefore his people return hither:
c67956	and waters of a full <i>cup</i> are wrung out to them.
c67957	And they say,
c67958	How doth God know?
c67959	and is there knowledge in the most High?
c67960	Behold, these <i>are</i> the ungodly,
c67961	who prosper in the world; they increase <i>in</i> riches.
c67962	Verily I have cleansed my heart <i>in</i> vain,
c67963	and washed my hands in innocency.
c67964	For all the day long have I been plagued,
c67965	and chastened every morning.
c67966	If I say,
c67967	I will speak thus;
c67968	behold, I should offend <i>against</i> the generation of thy children.
c67969	When I thought
c67970	to know this,
c67971	it <i>was</i> too painful for me;
c67972	Until I went into the sanctuary of God;
c67973	<i>then</i> understood I their end.
c67974	Surely thou didst set them in slippery places:
c67975	thou castedst them down into destruction.
c67976	How are they <i>brought</i> into desolation, as in a moment!
c67977	they are utterly consumed
c67978	with terrors.
c67979	As a dream
c67980	when <i>one</i> awaketh;
c67981	<i>so,</i> O Lord,
c67982	when thou awakest,
c67983	thou shalt despise their image.
c67984	Thus my heart was grieved,
c67985	and I was pricked in my reins.
c67986	So foolish <i>was</i> I,
c67987	and ignorant:
c67988	I was <i>as</i> a beast before thee.
c67989	Nevertheless I <i>am</i> continually with
c67990	thee: thou hast holden <i>me</i> by my right hand.
c67991	Thou shalt guide me with thy counsel,
c67992	and afterward receive me <i>to</i> glory.
c67993	Whom have I in heaven
c67994	<i>but thee?</i> and <i>there is</i> none upon earth <i>that</i> I desire beside thee.
c67995	My flesh and my heart faileth:
c67996	<i>but</i> God <i>is</i> the strength of my heart, and my portion for ever.
c67997	For, lo, they that are far from thee shall perish:
c67998	thou hast destroyed all
c67999	them that go a whoring from thee.
c68001	But <i>it is</i> good for me to draw near to God:
c68002	I have put my trust in the Lord GOD,
c68003	that I may declare all thy works.
c68004	<b>Maschil</b> <b>of Asaph.</b>
c68005	why
c68006	O God,
c68007	hast thou cast <i>us</i> off for ever?
c68008	<i>why</i> doth thine anger smoke against the sheep of thy pasture?
c68009	Remember thy congregation,
c68010	<i>which</i> thou hast purchased of old;
c68011	the rod of thine inheritance, <i>which</i> thou hast redeemed; this mount Zion,
c68012	wherein thou hast dwelt.
c68013	Lift up thy feet unto the perpetual desolations;
c68014	<i>even</i> all <i>that</i> the enemy hath done wickedly in the sanctuary.
c68015	Thine enemies roar in the midst of thy congregations;
c68016	they set up their ensigns <i>for</i> signs.
c68017	<i>A man</i> was famous
c68018	according as he had lifted up axes upon the thick trees.
c68019	But now they break down the carved work thereof at once with axes and hammers.
c68020	They have cast fire into thy sanctuary,
c68021	they have defiled <i>by casting down</i> the dwelling place of thy name to the ground.
c68022	They said in their hearts,
c68023	Let us destroy them together:
c68024	they have burned up all the synagogues of God in the land.
c68025	We see not our signs:
c68026	<i>there is</i> no more any prophet:
c68027	neither <i>is there</i> among us any that knoweth

c68029	how long
c68030	O God,
c68031	shall the adversary reproach?
c68032	shall the enemy blaspheme thy name for ever?
c68033	Why withdrawest thou thy hand, even thy right hand?
c68034	pluck <i>it</i> out of thy bosom.
c68035	For God <i>is</i> my King of old,
c68036	working salvation in the midst of the earth.
c68037	Thou didst divide the sea by thy strength:
c68038	thou brakest the heads of the dragons in the waters.
c68039	Thou brakest the heads of leviathan
c68040	in pieces, <i>and</i> gavest him <i>to be</i> meat to the people inhabiting the wilderness.
c68041	Thou didst cleave the fountain and the flood:
c68042	thou driedst up mighty rivers.
c68043	The day
c68044	<i>is</i> thine, the night also
c68045	<i>is</i> thine: thou hast prepared the light and the sun.
c68046	Thou hast set all the borders of the earth:
c68047	summer and winter.
c68048	thou hast made
c68049	Remember this,
c68050	<i>that</i> the enemy hath reproached,
c68051	O LORD,
c68052	and <i>that</i> the foolish people have blasphemed thy name.
c68053	O deliver not the soul of thy turtledove unto the multitude
c68054	<i>of the wicked:</i> forget not the congregation of thy poor for ever.
c68055	Have respect unto the covenant:
c68056	for the dark places of the earth are full of the habitations of cruelty.
c68057	O let not the oppressed return
c68058	ashamed:
c68059	let the poor and needy praise thy name.
c68060	Arise,
c68061	O God,
c68062	plead thine own cause:
c68063	remember how the foolish man reproacheth thee daily.
c68064	Forget not the voice of thine enemies:
c68065	the tumult of those that rise up against

c68206	O my people,
c68207	<i>to</i> my law:
c68208	incline your ears to the words of my mouth.
c68209	I will open my mouth in a parable:
c68210	I will utter dark sayings of old:
c68211	Which we have heard
c68212	and known,
c68213	and our fathers have told us.
c68214	We will not hide <i>them</i> from their children,
c68215	shewing to the generation to come the praises of the LORD, and his strength, and his wonderful works
c68216	that he hath done.
c68217	For he established a testimony in Jacob,
c68218	and appointed a law in Israel,
c68219	which he commanded our fathers,
c68220	that they should make them known to their children:
c68221	That the generation to come might know
c68222	<i>them, even</i> the children
c68223	<i>which</i> should be born;
c68224	<i>who</i> should arise
c68225	and declare <i>them</i> to their children:
c68226	That they might set their hope in God,
c68227	and not forget the works of God,
c68228	but keep his commandments:
c68229	And might not be as their fathers, a stubborn and rebellious generation; a generation
c68230	<i>that</i> set not their heart aright,
c68231	and whose spirit was not stedfast with God.
c68232	The children of Ephraim, <i>being</i> armed, <i>and</i> carrying bows, turned back in the day of battle.
c68233	They kept not the covenant of God,
c68234	and refused to walk in his law;
c68236	And forgat his works, and his wonders
c68237	that he had shewed them.
c68238	Marvellous things did he in the sight of their fathers, in the land of Egypt, <i>in</i> the field of Zoan.
c68239	He divided the sea,
c68240	and caused them to pass through;
c68241	and he made the waters to stand as an heap.
c68242	In the daytime also he led them with a cloud,
c68243	and all the night with a light of fire.
c68244	He clave the rocks in the wilderness,
c68245	and gave <i>them</i> drink as <i>out of</i> the great depths.
c68246	He brought streams also out of the rock,
c68247	and caused waters to run down like rivers.
c68248	yet more
c68249	And they sinned
c68250	against him by provoking the most High in the wilderness.
c68251	And they tempted God in their heart
c68252	by asking meat for their lust.
c68253	Yea, they spake against God;
c68254	they said,
c68255	Can God
c68256	furnish a table in the wilderness?
c68257	Behold, he smote the rock,
c68258	that the waters gushed out,
c68259	and the streams overflowed;
c68260	can he give bread also?
c68262	can he provide flesh for his people?
c68263	Therefore the LORD heard
c68264	<i>this,</i> and was wroth:
c68265	so a fire was kindled against Jacob,
c68266	and anger also came up against Israel;
c68267	Because they believed not in God,
c68268	and trusted not in his salvation:
c68269	Though he had commanded the clouds from above,
c68270	and opened the doors of heaven,
c68271	And had rained down manna upon
c68272	them to eat,
c68273	and had given them of the corn of heaven.
c68274	Man did eat angels' food:
c68275	he sent them meat to the full.
c68276	He caused an east wind to blow in the heaven:
c68277	and by his power he brought in the south wind.
c68278	He rained flesh also upon them as dust,
c68279	and feathered fowls like as the sand of the sea:
c68280	And he let <i>it</i> fall in the midst of their camp, round about their habitations.
c68281	So they did eat,
c68282	and were well filled:
c68283	for he gave them their own desire;
c68284	They were not estranged from their lust.
c68285	But while their meat <i>was</i> yet in their mouths,
c68286	The wrath of God came
c68287	upon them, and slew the fattest
c68288	of them, and smote down the chosen <i>men</i> of Israel.
c68289	For all this they sinned still,
c68290	and believed not for his wondrous works.
c68291	Therefore their days did he consume in vanity,
c68292	and their years in trouble.
c68293	When he slew
c68294	them, then they sought
c68295	him: and they returned
c68296	and enquired early after God.
c68297	And they remembered
c68298	that God <i>was</i> their rock,
c68299	and the high God their redeemer.
c68300	Nevertheless they did flatter him with their mouth,
c68301	and they lied unto him with their tongues.
c68302	For their heart was not right with
c68303	him, neither were they stedfast in his covenant.
c68304	But he, <i>being</i> full of compassion,
c68305	forgave <i>their</i> iniquity,
c68306	and destroyed <i>them</i> not:
c68307	yea, many
c68308	a time turned he his anger away,
c68309	and did not stir up all his wrath.
c68310	For he remembered
c68311	that they <i>were but</i> flesh;
c68312	a wind
c68313	that passeth away,
c68314	and cometh not again.
c68315	How oft did they provoke him in the wilderness,
c68316	<i>and</i> grieve him in the desert!
c68317	Yea, they turned back
c68318	and tempted God,
c68319	and limited the Holy One of Israel.
c68320	They remembered not his hand,
c68321	<i>nor</i> the day
c68322	when he delivered them from the enemy.
c68323	How he had wrought his signs in Egypt,
c68324	and his wonders in the field of Zoan:
c68325	And had turned their rivers into blood; and their floods,
c68326	that they could not drink.
c68327	He sent divers sorts of flies
c68328	among them, which devoured
c68329	them; and frogs,
c68330	which destroyed them.
c68331	He gave also their increase unto the caterpiller,
c68332	and their labour unto the locust.
c68333	He destroyed their vines with hail,
c68334	and their sycomore trees with frost.
c68335	He gave up their cattle also to the hail,
c68336	and their flocks to hot thunderbolts.
c68337	He cast upon them the fierceness of his anger, wrath, and indignation, and trouble, by sending evil angels <i>among them.</i>
c68338	He made a way to his anger;
c68339	he spared not their soul from death,
c68340	but gave their life over to the pestilence;
c68341	And smote all the firstborn in Egypt;
c68342	the chief of <i>their</i> strength in the tabernacles of Ham:
c68343	But made his own people to go forth like sheep,
c68344	and guided them in the wilderness like a flock.
c68345	And he led them on safely,
c68346	so that they feared not:
c68347	but the sea overwhelmed their enemies.
c68348	And he brought them to the border of his sanctuary, <i>even to</i> this mountain,
c68349	<i>which</i> his right hand had purchased.
c68350	He cast out the heathen also before
c68351	them, and divided them an inheritance by line,
c68352	and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents.
c68353	Yet they tempted
c68354	and provoked the most high God,
c68355	and kept not his testimonies:
c68356	But turned back,
c68357	and dealt unfaithfully like their fathers:
c68358	they were turned aside like a deceitful bow.
c68359	For they provoked him to anger with their high places,
c68360	and moved him to jealousy with their graven images.
c68361	When God heard
c68362	<i>this,</i> he was wroth,
c68363	and greatly abhorred Israel:
c68364	So that he forsook the tabernacle of Shiloh, the tent
c68365	<i>which</i> he placed among men;
c68366	And delivered his strength into captivity,
c68367	and his glory into the enemy's hand.
c68368	He gave his people over also unto the sword;
c68369	and was wroth with his inheritance.
c68370	The fire consumed their young men;
c68371	and their maidens were not given to marriage.
c68372	Their priests fell by the sword;
c68373	and their widows made no lamentation.
c68374	Then the Lord awaked as one out of sleep,
c68375	<i>and</i> like a mighty man
c68376	that shouteth by reason of wine.
c68377	And he smote his enemies in the hinder parts:
c68378	he put them to a perpetual reproach.
c68379	Moreover he refused the tabernacle of Joseph,
c68380	and chose not the tribe of Ephraim:
c68381	But chose the tribe of Judah, the mount Zion
c68382	which he loved.
c68383	And he built his sanctuary like high
c68384	<i>palaces,</i> like the earth
c68385	which he hath established for ever.
c68386	He chose David also his servant,
c68387	and took him from the sheepfolds:
c68388	From following the ewes great with young he brought
c68389	him to feed Jacob his people, and Israel his inheritance.
c68390	So he fed them according to the integrity of his heart;
c68391	and guided them by the skilfulness of his hands.

c68395	thy holy temple have they defiled;
c68396	they have laid Jerusalem on heaps.
c68397	The dead bodies of thy servants have they given <i>to be</i> meat unto the fowls of the heaven,

c68424	let him be known among the heathen in our sight <i>by</i> the revenging of the blood of thy servants

c68426	Let the sighing of the prisoner come before
c68427	thee; according to the greatness of thy power preserve thou those that are appointed to die;

c68838	Thy fierce wrath goeth over

c68840	They came round about me daily like water;

c68845	I will sing of the mercies of the LORD for ever:
c68846	with my mouth will I make known thy faithfulness to all generations.
c68847	For I have said,
c68848	Mercy shall be built up for ever:

c68850	thy faithfulness shalt thou establish
c68851	I have made a covenant with my chosen,

c68855	Selah.
c68856	And the heavens shall praise thy wonders,
c68857	O LORD:
c68858	thy faithfulness also in the congregation of the saints.
c68859	For who in the heaven can be compared unto the LORD?
c68860	<i>who</i> among the sons of the mighty can be likened unto the LORD?
c68861	God is greatly to be feared in the assembly of the saints,
c68862	and to be had in reverence of all <i>them that are</i> about him.
c68863	O LORD God of hosts,
c68864	who <i>is</i> a strong LORD like unto thee?
c68866	or to thy faithfulness round about thee?
c68867	Thou rulest the raging of the sea:
c68868	when the waves thereof arise,
c68869	thou stillest them.
c68870	Thou hast broken Rahab in pieces, as one that is slain;
c68871	thou hast scattered thine enemies with thy strong arm.
c68872	The heavens
c68873	<i>are</i> thine, the earth also
c68874	<i>is</i> thine: <i>as for</i> the world and the fulness
c68875	thereof, thou hast founded them.
c68876	The north and the south
c68877	thou hast created
c68878	them: Tabor and Hermon shall rejoice in thy name.
c68879	Thou hast a mighty arm:
c68880	strong is thy hand,
c68881	<i>and</i> high is thy right hand.
c68882	Justice and judgment <i>are</i> the habitation of thy throne:
c68883	mercy and truth shall go before thy face.
c68884	Blessed <i>is</i> the people
c68885	that know the joyful sound:
c68887	they shall walk, O LORD, in the light of thy countenance.
c68888	In thy name shall they rejoice all the day:
c68889	and in thy righteousness shall they be exalted.
c68890	For thou <i>art</i> the glory of their strength:
c68891	and in thy favour our horn shall be exalted.
c68892	For the LORD <i>is</i> our defence;
c68893	and the Holy One of Israel <i>is</i> our king.
c68894	Then thou spakest in vision to thy holy one,
c68895	and saidst,
c68896	I have laid help upon <i>one that is</i> mighty;
c68897	I have exalted <i>one</i> chosen out of the people.
c68898	I have found David my servant;
c68899	with my holy oil have I anointed him:
c68900	With whom my hand shall be established:
c68901	mine arm also shall strengthen him.
c68902	The enemy shall not exact
c68903	upon him; nor the son of wickedness afflict him.
c68904	And I will beat down his foes before his face,
c68905	and plague them that hate him.
c68906	But my faithfulness and my mercy <i>shall be</i> with
c68907	him: and in my name shall his horn be exalted.
c68908	I will set his hand also in the sea,
c68909	and his right hand in the rivers.
c68910	He shall cry
c68911	unto me, Thou <i>art</i> my father,
c68912	my God, and the rock of my salvation.
c68913	Also I will make him <i>my</i> firstborn,
c68914	higher than the kings of the earth.
c68915	My mercy will I keep for him for evermore,
c68916	and my covenant shall stand fast with him.
c68917	His seed also will I make <i>to endure</i> for ever,
c68918	and his throne as the days of heaven.
c68919	If his children forsake my law,
c68920	and walk not in my judgments;
c68921	If they break my statutes,
c68922	and keep not my commandments;
c68923	Then will I visit their transgression with the rod,
c68924	and their iniquity with stripes.
c68925	Nevertheless my lovingkindness will I not utterly take from
c68926	him, nor suffer my faithfulness to fail.
c68927	My covenant will I not break,
c68928	nor alter the thing that is gone out of my lips.
c68929	Once have I sworn by my holiness
c68930	that I will not lie unto David.
c68931	His seed shall endure for ever,
c68932	and his throne as the sun before me.
c68933	It shall be established for ever as the moon,
c68934	and <i>as</i> a faithful witness in heaven.
c68935	Selah.
c68936	But thou hast cast off
c68937	and abhorred,
c68938	thou hast been wroth with thine anointed.
c68939	Thou hast made void the covenant of thy servant:
c68940	thou hast profaned his crown <i>by casting it</i> to the ground.
c68941	Thou hast broken down all his hedges;
c68942	thou hast brought his strong holds to ruin.
c68943	All that pass by the way spoil
c68944	him: he is a reproach to his neighbours.
c68945	Thou hast set up the right hand of his adversaries;
c68946	thou hast made all his enemies to rejoice.
c68947	Thou hast also turned the edge of his sword,
c68948	and hast not made him to stand in the battle.
c68949	Thou hast made his glory to cease,
c68950	and cast his throne down to the ground.
c68951	The days of his youth hast thou shortened:
c68952	thou hast covered him with shame.
c68953	Selah.
c68954	How long,
c68955	LORD?
c68956	wilt thou hide thyself for ever?
c68957	shall thy wrath burn like fire?
c68958	Remember

c68961	time is: wherefore hast thou made all men in vain?
c68962	What man
c68963	<i>is he that</i> liveth,
c68964	and shall not see death?
c68965	shall he deliver his soul from the hand of the grave?

c68974	Wherewith thine enemies have reproached,
c68975	O LORD;

c68979	<b>A Prayer</b> <b>of Moses</b> <b>the man</b> <b>of God.</b>
c68980	Lord,

c68982	Before the mountains were brought forth,
c68983	or ever thou hadst formed the earth and the world,
c68984	even from everlasting to everlasting, thou <i>art</i> God.
c68985	Thou turnest man to destruction;
c68986	and sayest,
c68987	Return,
c68988	ye children of men.
c68989	For a thousand years in thy sight <i>are but</i> as yesterday
c68990	when it is past,
c68991	and <i>as</i> a watch in the night.
c68992	Thou carriest them away as with a flood;
c68993	they are <i>as</i> a sleep:
c68994	in the morning <i>they are</i> like grass
c68995	<i>which</i> groweth up.
c68996	In the morning it flourisheth,
c68997	and groweth up;
c68998	in the evening it is cut down,
c68999	and withereth.
c69000	For we are consumed by thine anger,
c69001	and by thy wrath are we troubled.
c69002	Thou hast set our iniquities before
c69003	thee, our secret <i>sins</i> in the light of thy countenance.
c69004	For all our days are passed away in thy wrath:
c69005	we spend our years as a tale <i>that is told.</i>
c69006	The days of our years
c69007	<i>are</i> threescore years and ten;
c69009	and if by reason of strength
c69010	<i>they be</i> fourscore years,
c69011	yet <i>is</i> their strength labour and sorrow;
c69012	for it is soon cut off,
c69013	and we fly away.
c69014	Who knoweth the power of thine anger?
c69015	even according to thy fear, <i>so is</i> thy wrath.
c69016	<i>us</i> to number our days,
c69017	So teach
c69018	that we may apply <i>our</i> hearts unto wisdom.
c69019	Return,
c69020	O LORD,
c69021	how long?
c69022	and let it repent thee concerning thy servants.
c69023	O satisfy us early with thy mercy;
c69024	that we may rejoice
c69025	and be glad all our days.
c69026	Make us glad according to the days
c69027	<i>wherein</i> thou hast afflicted
c69028	us, <i>and</i> the years
c69029	<i>wherein</i> we have seen evil.
c69030	Let thy work appear unto thy servants,
c69031	and thy glory unto their children.
c69032	And let the beauty of the LORD our God be upon
c69033	us: and establish thou the work of our hands upon
c69034	us; yea, the work of our hands
c69035	establish thou it.
c69036	He that dwelleth in the secret place of the most High
c69037	shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty.
c69038	I will say of the LORD,
c69039	<i>He is</i> my refuge and my fortress: my God;

c69041	Surely he shall deliver thee from the snare of the fowler,
c69042	<i>and</i> from the noisome pestilence.
c69043	He shall cover thee with his feathers,
c69044	and under his wings shalt thou trust:
c69045	his truth <i>shall be thy</i> shield and buckler.
c69046	Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night;
c69047	<i>nor</i> for the arrow
c69048	<i>that</i> flieth by day;
c69049	<i>Nor</i> for the pestilence
c69050	<i>that</i> walketh in darkness;

c69054	and ten thousand at thy right hand;
c69055	<i>but</i> it shall not come nigh thee.
c69056	Only with thine eyes shalt thou behold
c69057	and see the reward of the wicked.
c69058	Because thou
c69060	<i>which is</i> my refuge, <i>even</i> the most High, thy habitation;
c69061	hast made the LORD,
c69062	There shall no evil befall
c69063	thee, neither shall any plague come nigh thy dwelling.
c69064	For he shall give his angels charge
c69065	over thee, to keep thee in all thy ways.
c69066	They shall bear thee up in <i>their</i> hands,
c69067	lest thou dash thy foot against a stone.
c69068	Thou shalt tread upon the lion and adder:
c69069	the young lion and the dragon shalt thou trample under feet.
c69070	Because he hath set his love
c69071	upon me, therefore will I deliver
c69072	him: I will set him on high,
c69073	because he hath known my name.
c69074	He shall call upon

c69077	I will deliver

c69321	all the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our God.
c69322	Make a joyful noise unto the LORD,
c69323	all the earth:
c69324	make a loud noise,
c69325	and rejoice,
c69326	and sing praise.
c69327	Sing unto the LORD with the harp;
c69328	with the harp, and the voice of a psalm.
c69329	With trumpets and sound of cornet
c69330	make a joyful noise before the LORD, the King.
c69331	Let the sea roar, and the fulness
c69332	thereof; the world, and they that dwell therein.
c69333	Let the floods clap <i>their</i> hands:
c69334	let the hills be joyful together
c69335	Before the LORD;
c69336	for he cometh
c69337	to judge the earth:
c69338	with righteousness shall he judge the world,
c69339	and the people with equity.
c69340	The LORD reigneth;
c69341	let the people tremble:
c69342	he sitteth <i>between</i> the cherubims;
c69343	let the earth be moved.
c69344	The LORD <i>is</i> great in Zion;
c69345	and he <i>is</i> high above all the people.
c69346	Let them praise thy great and terrible name;
c69347	<i>for</i> it <i>is</i> holy.
c69348	The king's strength also loveth judgment;
c69349	thou dost establish equity,
c69350	thou executest judgment and righteousness in Jacob.
c69351	Exalt ye the LORD our God,
c69352	and worship at his footstool;
c69353	<i>for</i> he <i>is</i> holy.
c69354	Moses and Aaron among his priests,
c69355	and Samuel among them that call upon his name;
c69356	they called upon the LORD,
c69357	and he answered them.
c69358	He spake unto them in the cloudy pillar:
c69359	they kept his testimonies, and the ordinance
c69360	<i>that</i> he gave them.
c69362	Thou answeredst them, O LORD our God: thou
c69363	wast a God that forgavest
c69364	them, though thou tookest vengeance of their inventions.
c69365	Exalt the LORD our God,
c69366	and worship at his holy hill;
c69367	for the LORD our God <i>is</i> holy.

c69386	<b>A Psalm</b>
c69387	I will sing of mercy and judgment:
c69389	unto thee, O LORD,
c69390	will I sing.
c69391	I will behave myself wisely in a perfect way.
c69392	O when wilt thou come unto
c69393	me? I will walk within my house with a perfect heart.
c69394	I will set no wicked thing before mine eyes:
c69395	the work of them that turn aside;
c69396	I hate
c69397	<i>it</i> shall not cleave to me.
c69398	A froward heart shall depart from
c69399	me: I will not know a wicked <i>person.</i>
c69400	Whoso privily slandereth his neighbour,
c69401	him will I cut off:
c69402	him that hath an high look and a proud heart
c69403	will not I suffer.
c69404	Mine eyes <i>shall be</i> upon the faithful of the land,
c69405	that they may dwell with
c69406	me: he that walketh in a perfect way,
c69407	he shall serve me.
c69408	shall not dwell within my house:
c69409	He that worketh deceit
c69410	he that telleth lies
c69411	shall not tarry in my sight.
c69412	I will early destroy all the wicked of the land;
c69413	that I may cut off all wicked doers from the city of the LORD.
c69414	<b>A Prayer</b> <b>of the afflicted,</b>
c69415	<b>when</b> <b>he is overwhelmed,</b>
c69416	<b>and poureth out</b> <b>his complaint</b> <b>before</b> <b>the LORD.</b>
c69417	O LORD,
c69418	Hear my prayer,
c69419	and let my cry come unto thee.
c69420	Hide not thy face from
c69421	me in the day
c69422	<i>when</i> I am in trouble;
c69423	incline thine ear unto
c69424	me: in the day
c69425	<i>when</i> I call
c69426	me speedily.
c69427	answer
c69428	For my days are consumed like smoke,
c69429	and my bones are burned as an hearth.
c69430	like grass;
c69431	My heart is smitten, and withered
c69432	so that I forget
c69433	to eat my bread.
c69434	By reason of the voice of my groaning my bones cleave to my skin.
c69435	I am like a pelican of the wilderness:
c69436	I am like an owl of the desert.
c69437	I watch,
c69438	and am as a sparrow
c69439	alone upon the house top.
c69440	Mine enemies reproach me all the day;
c69441	<i>and</i> they that are mad against me are sworn against me.
c69442	For I have eaten ashes like bread,
c69443	and mingled my drink with weeping,
c69444	Because of thine indignation and thy wrath:
c69445	for thou hast lifted me up,
c69446	and cast me down.
c69447	My days <i>are</i> like a shadow that declineth;
c69448	and I am withered like grass.
c69449	But thou,
c69450	O LORD,
c69451	shalt endure for ever;
c69452	and thy remembrance unto all generations.
c69453	Thou shalt arise,
c69454	<i>and</i> have mercy upon Zion:
c69455	for the time
c69456	to favour
c69457	her, yea, the set time, is come.
c69458	For thy servants take pleasure in her stones,
c69459	and favour the dust thereof.
c69460	So the heathen shall fear the name of the LORD,
c69461	and all the kings of the earth thy glory.
c69462	When the LORD shall build up Zion,
c69463	he shall appear in his glory.
c69464	He will regard the prayer of the destitute,
c69465	and not despise their prayer.
c69466	This shall be written for the generation to come:
c69467	and the people which shall be created shall praise the LORD.
c69468	For he hath looked down from the height of his sanctuary;
c69469	from heaven did the LORD behold the earth;
c69470	To hear the groaning of the prisoner;
c69471	to loose those that are appointed to death;
c69472	To declare the name of the LORD in Zion,
c69473	and his praise in Jerusalem;
c69474	When the people are gathered together,
c69475	and the kingdoms,
c69476	to serve the LORD.
c69477	He weakened my strength in the way;
c69478	he shortened my days.
c69479	I said,
c69480	O my God,
c69481	take me not away in the midst of my days:
c69482	thy years <i>are</i> throughout all generations.
c69483	Of old hast thou laid the foundation of the earth:
c69484	and the heavens <i>are</i> the work of thy hands.
c69485	They shall perish,
c69486	but thou shalt endure:
c69487	yea, all of them shall wax old like a garment;
c69488	as a vesture shalt thou change
c69489	them, and they shall be changed:
c69490	But thou <i>art</i> the same,
c69491	and thy years shall have no end.
c69492	The children of thy servants shall continue,
c69493	and their seed shall be established before thee.
c69494	<b><i>A Psalm</i> of David.</b>
c69495	Bless
c69496	O my soul:
c69497	the LORD,
c69499	and all that is within
c69500	me, <i>bless</i> his holy name.
c69501	Bless
c69502	O my soul,
c69503	the LORD,
c69504	and forget not all his benefits:
c69505	Who forgiveth all thine iniquities;
c69506	who healeth all thy diseases;
c69507	Who redeemeth thy life from destruction;
c69508	who crowneth thee with lovingkindness and tender mercies;
c69509	Who satisfieth thy mouth with good
c69510	<i>things; so that</i> thy youth is renewed like the eagle's.
c69511	The LORD executeth righteousness
c69512	and judgment for all that are oppressed.
c69513	He made known his ways unto Moses,
c69514	his acts unto the children of Israel.
c69515	The LORD <i>is</i> merciful and gracious,
c69516	slow to anger, and plenteous in mercy.
c69517	He will not always chide:
c69518	neither will he keep <i>his anger</i> for ever.
c69519	He hath not dealt with us after our sins;
c69520	nor rewarded us according to our iniquities.
c69521	For
c69522	as the heaven is high above the earth,
c69523	<i>so</i> great is his mercy toward them that fear him.
c69525	As far as the east is from the west, <i>so</i> far hath he removed our transgressions from us.
c69526	Like as a father pitieth <i>his</i> children,
c69527	<i>so</i> the LORD pitieth them that fear him.
c69528	For he knoweth our frame;
c69529	he remembereth
c69530	that we <i>are</i> dust.
c69531	<i>As for</i> man,
c69532	his days <i>are</i> as grass:
c69533	as a flower of the field,
c69534	so he flourisheth.
c69535	For the wind passeth
c69536	over it, and it is gone;
c69537	and the place thereof shall know it no more.
c69538	But the mercy of the LORD <i>is</i> from everlasting to everlasting upon them that fear
c69539	him, and his righteousness unto children's children;
c69540	To such as keep his covenant, and to those that remember his commandments
c69541	to do them.
c69542	The LORD hath prepared his throne in the heavens;
c69543	and his kingdom ruleth over all.
c69544	Bless the LORD,
c69545	ye his angels, that excel in strength,
c69546	that do his commandments,
c69547	hearkening unto the voice of his word.
c69548	Bless ye the LORD,
c69549	all <i>ye</i> his hosts; <i>ye</i> ministers
c69550	of his, that do his pleasure.
c69551	Bless the LORD,
c69552	all his works in all places of his dominion:
c69553	bless
c69554	O my soul.
c69555	the LORD,
c69556	Bless
c69557	O my soul.
c69558	the LORD,
c69559	O LORD my God,
c69560	thou art very great;
c69561	thou art clothed with honour and majesty.
c69562	Who coverest <i>thyself</i> with light as <i>with</i> a garment:
c69563	who stretchest out the heavens like a curtain:
c69564	Who layeth the beams of his chambers in the waters:
c69565	who maketh the clouds his chariot:
c69566	who walketh upon the wings of the wind:
c69567	Who maketh his angels spirits;
c69568	his ministers a flaming fire:
c69569	<i>Who</i> laid the foundations of the earth,
c69570	<i>that</i> it should not be removed for ever.
c69572	Thou coveredst it with the deep as <i>with</i> a garment:
c69573	the waters stood above the mountains.
c69574	At thy rebuke they fled;
c69575	at the voice of thy thunder they hasted away.
c69576	They go up by the mountains;
c69577	they go down by the valleys unto the place
c69578	which thou hast founded for them.
c69579	Thou hast set a bound
c69580	that they may not pass over;
c69581	that they turn not again
c69582	to cover the earth.
c69583	He sendeth the springs into the valleys,
c69584	<i>which</i> run among the hills.
c69585	They give drink to every beast of the field:
c69586	the wild asses quench their thirst.
c69587	By them shall the fowls of the heaven have their habitation,
c69588	<i>which</i> sing among the branches.
c69589	He watereth the hills from his chambers:
c69590	the earth is satisfied with the fruit of thy works.
c69591	He causeth the grass to grow for the cattle,
c69592	and herb for the service of man:
c69593	that he may bring forth food out of the earth;
c69594	And wine
c69595	<i>that</i> maketh glad the heart of man,
c69596	<i>and</i> oil to make <i>his</i> face to shine,
c69597	and bread
c69598	<i>which</i> strengtheneth man's heart.
c69599	The trees of the LORD are full
c69600	<i>of sap;</i> the cedars of Lebanon,
c69601	which he hath planted;
c69602	Where the birds make their nests:
c69603	<i>as for</i> the stork,
c69604	the fir trees <i>are</i> her house.
c69605	The high hills <i>are</i> a refuge for the wild goats;
c69606	<i>and</i> the rocks for the conies.
c69607	He appointed the moon for seasons:
c69608	the sun knoweth his going down.
c69609	Thou makest darkness,
c69610	and it is night:
c69611	wherein all the beasts of the forest do creep <i>forth.</i>
c69612	The young lions roar after their prey,
c69613	and seek their meat from God.
c69614	The sun ariseth,
c69615	they gather themselves together,
c69616	and lay them down in their dens.
c69617	Man goeth forth unto his work and to his labour until the evening.
c69618	how manifold are thy works!
c69619	O LORD,
c69620	in wisdom hast thou made them all:
c69621	the earth is full of thy riches.
c69622	<i>So is</i> this great and wide sea,
c69624	wherein <i>are</i> things creeping
c69625	innumerable,
c69626	both small and great beasts.
c69627	There go the ships:
c69628	<i>there is</i> that leviathan,
c69629	<i>whom</i> thou hast made
c69630	to play therein.
c69631	These wait all upon
c69632	thee; that thou mayest give <i>them</i> their meat in due season.
c69633	<i>That</i> thou givest
c69634	them they gather:
c69635	thou openest thine hand,
c69636	they are filled with good.
c69637	Thou hidest thy face,
c69638	they are troubled:
c69639	thou takest away their breath,
c69640	they die,
c69641	and return to their dust.
c69642	Thou sendest forth thy spirit,
c69643	they are created:
c69644	and thou renewest the face of the earth.
c69645	The glory of the LORD shall endure for ever:
c69646	the LORD shall rejoice in his works.
c69647	He looketh on the earth,
c69648	and it trembleth:
c69649	he toucheth the hills,
c69650	and they smoke.
c69651	I will sing unto the LORD as long as I live:
c69652	I will sing praise to my God while I have my being.
c69653	My meditation of him shall be sweet:
c69654	I will be glad in the LORD.
c69655	Let the sinners be consumed out of the earth,
c69656	and let the wicked
c69657	be no more.
c69658	Bless

c69660	thou the LORD,
c69661	Praise ye the LORD.
c69662	O give thanks unto the LORD;
c69663	call upon his name:
c69664	make known his deeds among the people.
c69665	Sing
c69666	unto him, sing psalms
c69667	unto him: talk ye of all his wondrous works.
c69668	Glory ye in his holy name:
c69669	let the heart of them rejoice that seek the LORD.
c69670	Seek the LORD, and his strength:
c69671	seek his face evermore.
c69672	Remember his marvellous works
c69673	that he hath done;
c69674	his wonders, and the judgments of his mouth;
c69675	O ye seed of Abraham his servant,
c69676	ye children of Jacob his chosen.
c69677	He <i>is</i> the LORD our God:
c69678	his judgments <i>are</i> in all the earth.
c69679	He hath remembered his covenant for ever,
c69680	the word
c69681	<i>which</i> he commanded to a thousand generations.
c69682	Which <i>covenant</i> he made with Abraham,
c69683	and his oath unto Isaac;
c69684	And confirmed the same unto Jacob for a law,
c69685	<i>and</i> to Israel <i>for</i> an everlasting covenant:
c69686	Saying,
c69687	Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan, the lot of your inheritance:
c69688	When they were <i>but</i> a few men in number; yea, very few,
c69689	and strangers in it.
c69690	When they went from one nation to another,
c69691	from <i>one</i> kingdom to another people;
c69692	He suffered no man
c69693	to do them wrong:
c69694	yea, he reproved kings for their sakes;
c69695	<i>Saying,</i> Touch not mine anointed,
c69696	and do my prophets no harm.
c69697	Moreover he called for a famine upon the land:
c69698	he brake the whole staff of bread.
c69699	He sent a man before
c69700	them, <i>even</i> Joseph, <i>who</i> was sold for a servant:
c69701	Whose feet they hurt with fetters:
c69702	he was laid in iron:
c69703	Until the time
c69704	that his word came:
c69705	the word of the LORD tried him.
c69706	The king sent
c69707	and loosed
c69708	him; <i>even</i> the ruler of the people,
c69709	and let him go free.
c69710	He made him lord of his house,
c69711	and ruler of all his substance:
c69712	To bind his princes at his pleasure;
c69713	and teach his senators wisdom.
c69714	Israel also came into Egypt;
c69715	and Jacob sojourned in the land of Ham.
c69716	And he increased his people greatly;
c69717	and made them stronger than their enemies.
c69718	He turned their heart
c69719	to hate his people,
c69720	to deal subtilly with his servants.
c69721	He sent Moses his servant;
c69722	<i>and</i> Aaron
c69723	whom he had chosen.
c69724	They shewed his signs
c69725	among them, and wonders in the land of Ham.
c69726	He sent darkness,
c69727	and made it dark;
c69728	and they rebelled not against his word.
c69729	He turned their waters into blood,
c69730	and slew their fish.
c69731	Their land brought forth frogs in abundance, in the chambers of their kings.
c69732	He spake,
c69733	and there came divers sorts of flies,
c69734	<i>and</i> lice in all their coasts.
c69735	He gave them hail for rain,
c69736	<i>and</i> flaming fire in their land.
c69737	He smote their vines also and their fig trees;
c69738	and brake the trees of their coasts.
c69739	He spake,
c69740	and the locusts came,
c69741	and caterpillers,
c69742	and that without number,
c69743	And did eat up all the herbs in their land,
c69744	and devoured the fruit of their ground.
c69745	He smote also all the firstborn in their land,
c69746	the chief of all their strength.
c69747	He brought them forth also with silver and gold:
c69748	and <i>there was</i> not one feeble <i>person</i> among their tribes.
c69749	Egypt was glad
c69750	when they departed:
c69751	for the fear of them fell upon them.
c69752	He spread a cloud for a covering;
c69753	and fire
c69754	to give light in the night.
c69755	<i>The people</i> asked,
c69756	and he brought quails,
c69757	and satisfied them with the bread of heaven.
c69758	He opened the rock,
c69759	and the waters gushed out;
c69760	they ran in the dry places <i>like</i> a river.
c69761	For he remembered his holy promise,
c69762	<i>and</i> Abraham his servant.
c69763	And he brought forth his people with joy,
c69764	<i>and</i> his chosen with gladness:
c69765	And gave them the lands of the heathen:
c69766	and they inherited the labour of the people;
c69767	That they might observe his statutes,
c69768	and keep his laws.
c69769	Praise ye the LORD.
c69770	Praise ye the LORD.
c69771	O give thanks unto the LORD;
c69772	for <i>he is</i> good:
c69773	for his mercy <i>endureth</i> for ever.
c69774	Who can utter the mighty acts of the LORD?
c69775	<i>who</i> can shew forth all his praise?
c69776	Blessed
c69777	<i>are</i> they that keep judgment,
c69778	<i>and</i> he that doeth righteousness at all times.
c69779	Remember
c69780	me, O LORD,
c69781	with the favour <i>that thou bearest unto</i> thy people:
c69782	O visit me with thy salvation;
c69783	That I may see the good of thy chosen,
c69784	that I may rejoice in the gladness of thy nation,
c69785	that I may glory with thine inheritance.
c69786	We have sinned with our fathers,
c69787	we have committed iniquity,
c69788	we have done wickedly.
c69789	Our fathers understood not thy wonders in Egypt;
c69790	they remembered not the multitude of thy mercies;
c69791	but provoked <i>him</i> at the sea, <i>even</i> at the Red sea.
c69792	Nevertheless he saved them for his name's sake,
c69793	that he might make his mighty power to be known.
c69794	He rebuked the Red sea
c69795	also, and it was dried up:
c69796	so he led them through the depths, as through the wilderness.
c69797	And he saved them from the hand of him that hated
c69798	<i>them,</i> and redeemed them from the hand of the enemy.
c69799	And the waters covered their enemies:
c69800	there was not one of them left.
c69801	Then believed they his words;
c69802	they sang his praise.
c69803	They soon
c69804	forgat his works;
c69805	they waited not for his counsel:
c69806	But lusted exceedingly in the wilderness,
c69807	and tempted God in the desert.
c69808	And he gave them their request;
c69809	but sent leanness into their soul.
c69810	They envied Moses also in the camp,
c69811	<i>and</i> Aaron the saint of the LORD.
c69812	The earth opened
c69813	and swallowed up Dathan,
c69814	and covered the company of Abiram.
c69815	And a fire was kindled in their company;
c69816	the flame burned up the wicked.
c69817	They made a calf in Horeb,
c69818	and worshipped the molten image.
c69819	Thus they changed their glory into the similitude of an ox
c69820	that eateth grass.
c69821	They forgat God their saviour,
c69822	which had done great things in Egypt;
c69823	Wondrous works in the land of Ham,
c69824	<i>and</i> terrible things by the Red sea.
c69825	Therefore he said
c69826	that he would destroy
c69827	them, had not Moses his chosen stood before him in the breach,
c69828	to turn away his wrath,
c69829	lest he should destroy <i>them.</i>
c69830	Yea, they despised the pleasant land,
c69831	they believed not his word:
c69832	But murmured in their tents,
c69833	<i>and</i> hearkened not unto the voice of the LORD.
c69834	Therefore he lifted up his hand
c69835	against them, to overthrow them in the wilderness:
c69836	To overthrow their seed also among the nations,
c69837	and to scatter them in the lands.
c69838	They joined themselves also unto Baalpeor,
c69839	and ate the sacrifices of the dead.
c69840	Thus they provoked <i>him</i> to anger with their inventions:
c69841	and the plague brake in upon them.
c69842	Then stood up Phinehas,
c69843	and executed judgment:
c69844	and <i>so</i> the plague was stayed.
c69845	And that was counted unto him for righteousness unto all generations for evermore.
c69846	They angered <i>him</i> also at the waters of strife,
c69847	so that it went ill with Moses for their sakes:
c69848	Because they provoked his spirit,
c69849	so that he spake unadvisedly with his lips.
c69850	They did not destroy the nations,
c69851	concerning whom the LORD commanded them:
c69852	But were mingled among the heathen,
c69853	and learned their works.
c69854	And they served their idols:
c69855	which were a snare unto them.
c69856	Yea, they sacrificed their sons and their daughters unto devils,
c69857	And shed innocent blood, <i>even</i> the blood of their sons and of their daughters,
c69858	whom they sacrificed unto the idols of Canaan:
c69859	and the land was polluted with blood.
c69860	Thus were they defiled with their own works,
c69861	and went a whoring with their own inventions.
c69862	Therefore was the wrath of the LORD kindled against his people,
c69863	insomuch that he abhorred his own inheritance.
c69864	And he gave them into the hand of the heathen;
c69865	and they that hated them ruled over them.
c69866	Their enemies also oppressed
c69867	them, and they were brought into subjection under their hand.
c69868	Many times did he deliver
c69869	them; but they provoked <i>him</i> with their counsel,
c69870	and were brought low for their iniquity.
c69871	Nevertheless he regarded their affliction,
c69872	when he heard their cry:
c69873	And he remembered for them his covenant,
c69874	and repented according to the multitude of his mercies.
c69875	He made them also to be pitied of all those that carried them captives.
c69876	Save
c69877	us, O LORD our God,
c69878	and gather us from among the heathen,
c69879	to give thanks unto thy holy name,
c69880	<i>and</i> to triumph in thy praise.
c69881	Blessed <i>be</i> the LORD God of Israel from everlasting to everlasting:
c69882	and let all the people say,
c69883	Amen. Praise ye the LORD.
c69884	O give thanks unto the LORD,
c69885	for <i>he is</i> good:
c69886	for his mercy <i>endureth</i> for ever.
c69887	Let the redeemed of the LORD say
c69888	<i>so,</i> whom he hath redeemed from the hand of the enemy;
c69889	And gathered them out of the lands, from the east, and from the west, from the north, and from the south.
c69890	They wandered in the wilderness in a solitary way;
c69891	they found no city to dwell in.
c69892	Hungry
c69893	and thirsty,
c69894	their soul fainted in them.
c69895	Then they cried unto the LORD in their trouble,
c69896	<i>and</i> he delivered them out of their distresses.
c69897	And he led them forth by the right way,
c69898	that they might go to a city of habitation.
c69899	Oh that <i>men</i> would praise the LORD <i>for</i> his goodness, and <i>for</i> his wonderful works to the children of men!
c69900	For he satisfieth the longing soul,
c69901	and filleth the hungry soul with goodness.
c69902	Such as sit in darkness and in the shadow of death,
c69903	<i>being</i> bound in affliction and iron;
c69904	Because they rebelled against the words of God,
c69905	and contemned the counsel of the most High:
c69906	Therefore he brought down their heart with labour;
c69907	they fell down,
c69908	and <i>there was</i> none to help.
c69909	Then they cried unto the LORD in their trouble,
c69910	<i>and</i> he saved them out of their distresses.
c69911	He brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death,
c69912	and brake their bands in sunder.
c69913	Oh that <i>men</i> would praise the LORD <i>for</i> his goodness, and <i>for</i> his wonderful works to the children of men!
c69914	For he hath broken the gates of brass,
c69915	and cut the bars of iron in sunder.
c69916	Fools because of their transgression, and because of their iniquities, are afflicted.
c69917	Their soul abhorreth all manner of meat;
c69918	and they draw near unto the gates of death.
c69919	Then they cry unto the LORD in their trouble,
c69920	<i>and</i> he saveth them out of their distresses.
c69921	He sent his word,
c69922	and healed
c69923	them, and delivered <i>them</i> from their destructions.
c69924	Oh that <i>men</i> would praise the LORD <i>for</i> his goodness, and <i>for</i> his wonderful works to the children of men!
c69925	And let them sacrifice the sacrifices of thanksgiving,
c69926	and declare his works with rejoicing.
c69927	They that go down to the sea in ships,
c69928	that do business in great waters;
c69929	These see the works of the LORD, and his wonders in the deep.
c69930	For he commandeth,
c69931	and raiseth the stormy wind,
c69932	which lifteth up the waves thereof.
c69933	They mount up to the heaven,
c69934	they go down again to the depths:
c69935	their soul is melted because of trouble.
c69936	They reel to and fro,
c69937	and stagger like a drunken man,
c69938	and are at their wits' end.
c69939	Then they cry unto the LORD in their trouble,
c69940	and he bringeth them out of their distresses.
c69941	He maketh the storm a calm,
c69942	so that the waves thereof are still.
c69943	Then are they glad
c69944	because they be quiet;
c69945	so he bringeth them unto their desired haven.
c69946	Oh that <i>men</i> would praise the LORD <i>for</i> his goodness, and <i>for</i> his wonderful works to the children of men!
c69947	Let them exalt him also in the congregation of the people,
c69948	and praise him in the assembly of the elders.
c69949	He turneth rivers into a wilderness,
c69950	and the watersprings into dry ground;
c69951	A fruitful land into barrenness, for the wickedness of them that dwell therein.
c69952	He turneth the wilderness into a standing water,
c69953	and dry ground into watersprings.
c69954	And there he maketh the hungry to dwell,
c69955	that they may prepare a city for habitation;
c69956	And sow the fields,
c69957	and plant vineyards,
c69958	which may yield fruits of increase.
c69959	He blesseth
c69960	them also, so that they are multiplied greatly;
c69961	and suffereth not their cattle to decrease.
c69962	Again, they are minished
c69963	and brought low through oppression, affliction, and sorrow.
c69964	He poureth contempt upon princes,
c69965	and causeth them to wander in the wilderness,
c69966	<i>where there is</i> no way.
c69967	Yet setteth he the poor on high from affliction,
c69968	and maketh <i>him</i> families like a flock.
c69969	The righteous shall see
c69970	<i>it,</i> and rejoice:
c69971	and all iniquity shall stop her mouth.
c69972	Whoso <i>is</i> wise,
c69973	and will observe these
c69974	<i>things,</i> even they shall understand the lovingkindness of the LORD.

c70022	<b>A Psalm</b>
c70023	thy peace, O God of my praise;
c70024	Hold not
c70025	For the mouth of the wicked and the mouth of the deceitful are opened against
c70026	me: they have spoken against me with a lying tongue.
c70027	They compassed me about also with words of hatred;
c70028	and fought against me without a cause.
c70029	For my love they are my adversaries:
c70030	but I <i>give myself unto</i> prayer.
c70031	And they have rewarded me evil for good,
c70032	and hatred for my love.
c70033	Set thou a wicked man over
c70034	him: and let Satan stand at his right hand.
c70035	When he shall be judged,
c70036	let him be condemned:
c70037	and let his prayer become sin.
c70038	Let his days be few;

c70052	Let his posterity be

c70054	<i>and</i> in the generation following let their name be blotted out.
c70055	Let the iniquity of his fathers be remembered with the LORD;
c70056	and let not the sin of his mother be blotted out.
c70057	Let them be before the LORD continually,
c70058	that he may cut off the memory of them from the earth.
c70059	Because that he remembered not
c70060	to shew mercy,
c70061	but persecuted the poor and needy man, that he might even slay the broken in heart.
c70063	As he loved cursing,
c70064	so let it come
c70065	unto him: as he delighted not in blessing,
c70066	so let it be far from him.
c70067	As he clothed himself with cursing like as with his garment,
c70068	so let it come into his bowels like water,
c70069	and like oil into his bones.
c70070	Let it be unto him as the garment

c70286	The LORD preserveth the simple:
c70287	I was brought low,
c70288	and he helped me.
c70289	Return
c70290	O my soul;
c70291	unto thy rest,
c70292	for the LORD hath dealt bountifully with thee.
c70293	For thou hast delivered my soul from death,
c70294	mine eyes from tears,
c70295	<i>and</i> my feet from falling.
c70296	I will walk before the LORD in the land of the living.
c70297	I believed,
c70298	therefore have I spoken:
c70299	I was greatly afflicted:
c70300	I said
c70301	in my haste,
c70302	All men <i>are</i> liars.
c70303	What shall I render unto the LORD <i>for</i> all his benefits toward me?
c70304	I will take the cup of salvation,
c70305	and call upon the name of the LORD.
c70306	I will pay my vows unto the LORD now in the presence of all his people.
c70307	Precious in the sight of the LORD <i>is</i> the death of his saints.
c70308	truly
c70309	O LORD,
c70310	I <i>am</i> thy servant;
c70311	I <i>am</i> thy servant, <i>and</i> the son of thine handmaid:
c70312	thou hast loosed my bonds.
c70313	I will offer to thee the sacrifice of thanksgiving,
c70314	and will call upon the name of the LORD.
c70315	I will pay my vows unto the LORD now in the presence of all his people,
c70316	In the courts of the LORD'S house,
c70317	in the midst
c70318	of thee, O Jerusalem.
c70319	Praise ye the LORD.
c70320	O praise the LORD,
c70321	all ye nations:
c70322	praise
c70323	him, all ye people.
c70324	For his merciful kindness is great toward
c70325	us: and the truth of the LORD <i>endureth</i> for ever.
c70326	Praise ye the LORD.
c70327	O give thanks unto the LORD;
c70328	for <i>he is</i> good:
c70329	because his mercy <i>endureth</i> for ever.
c70330	Let Israel now say,
c70331	that his mercy <i>endureth</i> for ever.
c70332	Let the house of Aaron now say,
c70333	that his mercy <i>endureth</i> for ever.
c70334	Let them now that fear the LORD say,
c70335	that his mercy <i>endureth</i> for ever.
c70336	I called upon the LORD in distress:
c70337	the LORD answered me, <i>and set me</i> in a large place.
c70338	The LORD
c70339	<i>is</i> on my side; I will not fear:
c70340	what can man do unto me?
c70341	The LORD taketh my part with them that help
c70342	me: therefore shall I see <i>my desire</i> upon them that hate me.
c70343	<i>It is</i> better
c70344	to trust in the LORD
c70345	than to put confidence in man.
c70346	<i>It is</i> better
c70347	to trust in the LORD
c70348	than to put confidence in princes.
c70349	All nations compassed me about:
c70350	but in the name of the LORD
c70351	will I destroy them.
c70352	They compassed me about;
c70353	yea, they compassed me about:
c70354	but in the name of the LORD
c70355	I will destroy them.
c70356	They compassed me about like bees;
c70357	they are quenched as the fire of thorns:
c70358	for in the name of the LORD
c70359	I will destroy them.
c70360	Thou hast thrust sore
c70361	at me that I might fall:
c70362	but the LORD helped me.
c70363	The LORD <i>is</i> my strength and song,
c70364	and is become my salvation.
c70365	The voice of rejoicing and salvation <i>is</i> in the tabernacles of the righteous:
c70366	the right hand of the LORD doeth valiantly.
c70367	The right hand of the LORD is exalted:
c70368	the right hand of the LORD doeth valiantly.
c70369	I shall not die,
c70370	but live,
c70371	and declare the works of the LORD.
c70372	The LORD hath chastened me sore:
c70373	but he hath not given me over unto death.
c70374	Open to me the gates of righteousness:
c70375	I will go
c70376	into them, <i>and</i> I will praise the LORD:
c70377	This gate of the LORD,
c70378	into which the righteous shall enter.
c70379	I will praise
c70380	thee: for thou hast heard
c70381	me, and art become my salvation.
c70382	The stone
c70383	<i>which</i> the builders refused
c70384	is become the head <i>stone</i> of the corner.
c70385	This is the LORD'S doing;
c70386	it <i>is</i> marvellous in our eyes.
c70387	This <i>is</i> the day
c70388	<i>which</i> the LORD hath made;
c70389	we will rejoice
c70390	and be glad in it.
c70391	I beseech
c70392	thee, O LORD:
c70393	Save now,
c70394	I beseech
c70395	O LORD,
c70396	thee, send now prosperity.
c70397	Blessed
c70398	<i>be</i> he that cometh in the name of the LORD:
c70399	we have blessed you out of the house of the LORD.
c70400	God <i>is</i> the LORD,
c70401	which hath shewed us light:
c70402	bind the sacrifice with cords, <i>even</i> unto the horns of the altar.
c70403	Thou <i>art</i> my God,
c70404	and I will praise
c70405	thee: <i>thou art</i> my God,
c70406	I will exalt thee.
c70407	O give thanks unto the LORD;
c70408	for <i>he is</i> good:
c70409	for his mercy <i>endureth</i> for ever.
c70410	ALEPH. Blessed <i>are</i> the undefiled in the way,
c70411	who walk in the law of the LORD.
c70412	Blessed
c70413	<i>are</i> they that keep his testimonies,
c70414	<i>and that</i> seek him with the whole heart.
c70415	They also do no iniquity:
c70416	they walk in his ways.
c70417	Thou hast commanded <i>us</i> to keep thy precepts
c70418	diligently.
c70419	O that my ways were directed
c70420	to keep thy statutes!
c70421	Then shall I not be ashamed,
c70422	when I have respect unto all thy commandments.
c70423	I will praise thee with uprightness of heart,
c70424	when I shall have learned thy righteous judgments.
c70425	I will keep thy statutes:
c70426	O forsake me not utterly.
c70427	BETH. Wherewithal shall a young man cleanse his way?
c70428	by taking heed <i>thereto</i> according to thy word.
c70429	With my whole heart have I sought
c70430	thee: O let me not wander from thy commandments.
c70431	Thy word have I hid in mine heart,
c70432	that I might not sin against thee.
c70433	Blessed <i>art</i> thou,
c70434	O LORD:
c70435	teach me thy statutes.
c70436	With my lips have I declared all the judgments of thy mouth.
c70437	I have rejoiced in the way of thy testimonies, as <i>much as</i> in all riches.
c70438	I will meditate in thy precepts,
c70439	and have respect unto thy ways.
c70440	I will delight myself in thy statutes:
c70441	I will not forget thy word.
c70442	GIMEL. Deal bountifully with thy servant,
c70443	<i>that</i> I may live,
c70444	and keep thy word.
c70445	Open thou mine eyes,
c70446	that I may behold wondrous things out of thy law.
c70447	I <i>am</i> a stranger in the earth:
c70448	hide not thy commandments from me.
c70449	My soul breaketh for the longing <i>that it hath</i> unto thy judgments at all times.
c70450	Thou hast rebuked the proud <i>that are</i> cursed,
c70451	which do err from thy commandments.
c70452	Remove from me reproach and contempt;
c70453	for I have kept thy testimonies.
c70454	Princes also did sit
c70455	<i>and</i> speak
c70456	against me: <i>but</i> thy servant did meditate in thy statutes.
c70457	Thy testimonies also <i>are</i> my delight
c70458	<i>and</i> my counsellors.
c70459	DALETH. My soul cleaveth unto the dust:
c70460	quicken thou me according to thy word.
c70461	I have declared my ways,
c70462	and thou heardest
c70463	me: teach me thy statutes.
c70464	Make me to understand the way of thy precepts:
c70465	so shall I talk of thy wondrous works.
c70466	My soul melteth for heaviness:
c70467	strengthen thou me according unto thy word.
c70468	Remove from me the way of lying:
c70469	and grant me thy law graciously.
c70470	I have chosen the way of truth:
c70471	thy judgments have I laid <i>before me.</i>
c70472	I have stuck unto thy testimonies:
c70473	O LORD,
c70474	put me not to shame.
c70475	I will run the way of thy commandments,
c70476	when thou shalt enlarge my heart.
c70477	HE. Teach
c70478	me, O LORD,
c70479	the way of thy statutes;
c70480	and I shall keep it <i>unto</i> the end.
c70481	Give me understanding,
c70482	and I shall keep thy law;
c70483	yea, I shall observe it with <i>my</i> whole heart.
c70484	Make me to go in the path of thy commandments;
c70485	for therein do I delight.
c70486	Incline my heart unto thy testimonies,
c70487	and not to covetousness.
c70488	Turn away mine eyes
c70489	from beholding vanity;
c70490	<i>and</i> quicken thou me in thy way.
c70491	Stablish thy word unto thy servant,
c70492	who <i>is devoted</i> to thy fear.
c70493	Turn away my reproach
c70494	which I fear:
c70495	for thy judgments <i>are</i> good.
c70496	Behold, I have longed after thy precepts:
c70497	quicken me in thy righteousness.
c70498	VAU. Let thy mercies come
c70499	also unto me, O LORD,
c70500	<i>even</i> thy salvation, according to thy word.
c70501	So shall I have wherewith to answer him that reproacheth
c70502	me: for I trust in thy word.
c70503	And take not the word of truth utterly out of my mouth;
c70504	for I have hoped in thy judgments.
c70505	So shall I keep thy law continually for ever and ever.
c70506	And I will walk at liberty:
c70507	for I seek thy precepts.
c70508	I will speak of thy testimonies also before kings,
c70509	and will not be ashamed.
c70510	And I will delight myself in thy commandments,
c70511	which I have loved.
c70512	My hands also will I lift up unto thy commandments,
c70513	which I have loved;
c70514	and I will meditate in thy statutes.
c70515	ZAIN. Remember the word unto thy servant,
c70516	upon which thou hast caused me to hope.
c70517	This <i>is</i> my comfort in my affliction:
c70518	for thy word hath quickened me.
c70519	The proud have had me greatly in derision:
c70520	<i>yet</i> have I not declined from thy law.
c70521	I remembered thy judgments of old,
c70522	O LORD;
c70523	and have comforted myself.
c70524	Horror hath taken hold upon me because of the wicked
c70525	that forsake thy law.
c70526	Thy statutes have been my songs in the house of my pilgrimage.
c70527	I have remembered thy name, O LORD, in the night,
c70529	and have kept thy law.
c70530	This I had,
c70531	because I kept thy precepts.
c70532	CHETH. <i>Thou art</i> my portion, O LORD:
c70533	I have said
c70534	that I would keep thy words.
c70535	I intreated thy favour with <i>my</i> whole heart:
c70536	be merciful unto me according to thy word.
c70537	I thought on my ways,
c70538	and turned my feet unto thy testimonies.
c70539	I made haste,
c70540	and delayed not
c70541	to keep thy commandments.
c70542	The bands of the wicked have robbed
c70543	me: <i>but</i> I have not forgotten thy law.
c70544	At midnight I will rise
c70545	to give thanks unto thee because of thy righteous judgments.
c70546	I <i>am</i> a companion of all
c70547	<i>them</i> that fear
c70548	thee, and of them that keep thy precepts.
c70549	of thy mercy:
c70551	The earth, O LORD, is full
c70552	teach me thy statutes.
c70553	TETH. Thou hast dealt well with thy servant,
c70554	O LORD,
c70555	according unto thy word.
c70556	Teach me good judgment and knowledge:
c70557	for I have believed thy commandments.
c70558	Before I was afflicted
c70559	I went astray:
c70560	but now have I kept thy word.
c70561	Thou <i>art</i> good,
c70562	and doest good;
c70563	teach me thy statutes.
c70564	The proud have forged a lie against
c70565	me: <i>but</i> I will keep thy precepts with <i>my</i> whole heart.
c70566	Their heart is as fat as grease;
c70567	<i>but</i> I delight in thy law.
c70568	<i>It is</i> good
c70569	for me that I have been afflicted;
c70570	that I might learn thy statutes.
c70571	The law of thy mouth <i>is</i> better unto me than thousands of gold and silver.
c70572	JOD. Thy hands have made
c70573	me and fashioned
c70574	me: give me understanding,
c70575	that I may learn thy commandments.
c70576	They that fear thee will be glad when they see
c70578	me; because I have hoped in thy word.
c70579	I know,
c70580	O LORD,
c70581	that thy judgments <i>are</i> right,
c70582	and <i>that</i> thou in faithfulness hast afflicted me.
c70583	Let, I pray thee, thy merciful kindness be
c70584	for my comfort,
c70585	according to thy word unto thy servant.
c70586	Let thy tender mercies come
c70587	unto me, that I may live:
c70588	for thy law <i>is</i> my delight.
c70589	Let the proud be ashamed;
c70590	for they dealt perversely with me without a cause:
c70591	<i>but</i> I will meditate in thy precepts.
c70592	Let those that fear thee turn
c70593	unto me, and those that have known thy testimonies.
c70594	Let my heart be sound in thy statutes;
c70595	that I be not ashamed.
c70596	CAPH. My soul fainteth for thy salvation:
c70597	<i>but</i> I hope in thy word.
c70598	Mine eyes fail for thy word,
c70599	saying,
c70600	When wilt thou comfort me?
c70601	For I am become like a bottle in the smoke;
c70602	<i>yet</i> do I not forget thy statutes.
c70603	How many <i>are</i> the days of thy servant?
c70604	when wilt thou execute judgment on them that persecute me?
c70605	The proud have digged pits
c70606	for me, which <i>are</i> not after thy law.
c70607	All thy commandments <i>are</i> faithful:
c70608	they persecute me wrongfully;
c70609	help thou me.
c70610	They had almost consumed me upon earth;
c70611	but I forsook not thy precepts.
c70612	Quicken me after thy lovingkindness;
c70613	so shall I keep the testimony of thy mouth.
c70614	LAMED. For ever,
c70615	O LORD,
c70616	thy word is settled in heaven.
c70617	Thy faithfulness <i>is</i> unto all generations:
c70618	thou hast established the earth,
c70619	and it abideth.
c70620	They continue this day according to thine ordinances:
c70621	for all <i>are</i> thy servants.
c70622	Unless thy law <i>had been</i> my delights,
c70623	I should then have perished in mine affliction.
c70624	I will never forget thy precepts:
c70625	for with them thou hast quickened me.
c70626	I
c70627	<i>am</i> thine, save
c70628	me; for I have sought thy precepts.
c70629	The wicked have waited
c70630	for me to destroy
c70631	me: <i>but</i> I will consider thy testimonies.
c70632	I have seen an end of all perfection:
c70633	<i>but</i> thy commandment <i>is</i> exceeding broad.
c70634	MEM. O how love I thy law!
c70635	it <i>is</i> my meditation all the day.
c70636	Thou through thy commandments hast made me wiser than mine enemies:
c70637	for they <i>are</i> ever with me.
c70638	I have more understanding than all my teachers:
c70639	for thy testimonies <i>are</i> my meditation.
c70640	I understand more than the ancients,
c70641	because I keep thy precepts.
c70642	I have refrained my feet from every evil way,
c70643	that I might keep thy word.
c70644	I have not departed from thy judgments:
c70645	for thou hast taught me.
c70646	How sweet are thy words unto my taste!
c70647	<i>yea, sweeter</i> than honey to my mouth!
c70648	Through thy precepts I get understanding:
c70649	therefore I hate every false way.
c70650	NUN. Thy word <i>is</i> a lamp unto my feet,
c70651	and a light unto my path.
c70652	I have sworn,
c70653	and I will perform
c70654	<i>it,</i> that I will keep thy righteous judgments.
c70655	I am afflicted very much:
c70657	quicken me, O LORD, according unto thy word.
c70658	Accept, I beseech thee, the freewill offerings of my mouth,
c70659	O LORD,
c70660	and teach me thy judgments.
c70661	My soul <i>is</i> continually in my hand:
c70662	yet do I not forget thy law.
c70663	The wicked have laid a snare
c70664	for me: yet I erred not from thy precepts.
c70665	Thy testimonies have I taken as an heritage for ever:
c70666	for they <i>are</i> the rejoicing of my heart.
c70667	I have inclined mine heart
c70668	to perform thy statutes alway, <i>even unto</i> the end.
c70669	SAMECH. I hate <i>vain</i> thoughts:
c70670	but thy law do I love.
c70671	Thou <i>art</i> my hiding place and my shield:
c70672	I hope in thy word.
c70673	Depart from
c70674	me, ye evildoers:
c70675	for I will keep the commandments of my God.
c70676	Uphold me according unto thy word,
c70677	that I may live:
c70678	and let me not be ashamed of my hope.
c70679	Hold thou me up,
c70680	and I shall be safe:
c70681	and I will have respect unto thy statutes continually.
c70682	Thou hast trodden down all
c70683	them that err from thy statutes:
c70684	for their deceit <i>is</i> falsehood.
c70685	Thou puttest away all the wicked of the earth <i>like</i> dross:
c70686	therefore I love thy testimonies.
c70687	My flesh trembleth for fear
c70688	of thee; and I am afraid of thy judgments.
c70689	AIN. I have done judgment and justice:
c70690	leave me not to mine oppressors.
c70691	Be surety for thy servant for good:
c70692	let not the proud oppress me.
c70693	Mine eyes fail for thy salvation, and for the word of thy righteousness.
c70694	Deal with thy servant according unto thy mercy,
c70695	and teach me thy statutes.
c70696	I <i>am</i> thy servant;
c70697	give me understanding,
c70698	that I may know thy testimonies.
c70699	<i>It is</i> time
c70700	to work:
c70701	for <i>thee,</i> LORD,
c70702	<i>for</i> they have made void thy law.
c70703	Therefore I love thy commandments above gold; yea, above fine gold.
c70704	Therefore I esteem all <i>thy</i> precepts <i>concerning</i> all <i>things to be</i> right;
c70705	<i>and</i> I hate every false way.
c70706	PE. Thy testimonies <i>are</i> wonderful:
c70707	therefore doth my soul keep them.
c70708	The entrance of thy words giveth light;
c70709	it giveth understanding unto the simple.
c70710	I opened my mouth,
c70711	and panted:
c70712	for I longed for thy commandments.
c70713	Look thou upon
c70714	me, and be merciful unto me, as thou usest to do unto those that love thy name.
c70715	Order my steps in thy word:
c70716	and let not any iniquity have dominion over me.
c70717	Deliver me from the oppression of man:
c70718	so will I keep thy precepts.
c70719	Make thy face to shine upon thy servant;
c70720	and teach me thy statutes.
c70721	Rivers of waters run down mine eyes,
c70722	because they keep not thy law.
c70723	TZADDI. Righteous <i>art</i> thou,
c70724	O LORD,
c70725	and upright <i>are</i> thy judgments.
c70726	Thy testimonies <i>that</i> thou hast commanded <i>are</i> righteous and very faithful.
c70727	My zeal hath consumed
c70728	me, because mine enemies have forgotten thy words.
c70729	Thy word <i>is</i> very pure:
c70730	therefore thy servant loveth it.
c70731	I <i>am</i> small
c70732	and despised:
c70733	<i>yet</i> do not I forget thy precepts.
c70734	Thy righteousness <i>is</i> an everlasting righteousness,
c70735	and thy law <i>is</i> the truth.
c70736	Trouble and anguish have taken hold on
c70737	me: <i>yet</i> thy commandments <i>are</i> my delights.
c70738	The righteousness of thy testimonies <i>is</i> everlasting:
c70739	give me understanding,
c70740	and I shall live.
c70741	KOPH. I cried with <i>my</i> whole heart;
c70742	hear
c70743	me, O LORD:
c70744	I will keep thy statutes.
c70745	I cried
c70746	unto thee; save
c70747	me, and I shall keep thy testimonies.
c70748	I prevented the dawning
c70749	of the morning, and cried:
c70750	I hoped in thy word.
c70751	Mine eyes prevent the <i>night</i> watches,
c70752	that I might meditate in thy word.
c70753	Hear my voice according unto thy lovingkindness:
c70754	O LORD,
c70755	quicken me according to thy judgment.
c70756	They draw nigh that follow after mischief:
c70757	they are far from thy law.
c70758	Thou <i>art</i> near,
c70759	O LORD;
c70760	and all thy commandments <i>are</i> truth.
c70761	Concerning thy testimonies, I have known of old
c70762	that thou hast founded them for ever.
c70763	RESH. Consider mine affliction,
c70764	and deliver
c70765	me: for I do not forget thy law.
c70766	Plead my cause,
c70767	and deliver
c70768	me: quicken me according to thy word.
c70769	Salvation <i>is</i> far from the wicked:
c70770	for they seek not thy statutes.

c71260	Yea, they shall sing in the ways of the LORD:

c71262	Though the LORD <i>be</i> high,

c71273	<b>To the chief Musician,</b>

c71275	<b>A Psalm</b>
c71276	O LORD,
c71277	thou hast searched
c71278	me, and known <i>me.</i>
c71279	Thou knowest
c71280	my downsitting
c71281	and mine uprising,
c71282	thou understandest my thought afar off.
c71283	my path
c71284	and my lying down,
c71285	Thou compassest
c71286	and art acquainted <i>with</i> all my ways.
c71287	For <i>there is</i> not a word in my tongue,
c71288	<i>but,</i> lo,
c71289	O LORD,
c71290	thou knowest it altogether.
c71291	Thou hast beset me behind and before,
c71292	and laid thine hand upon me.
c71293	<i>Such</i> knowledge <i>is</i> too wonderful for
c71294	me; it is high,
c71295	I cannot <i>attain</i> unto it.
c71296	Whither shall I go from thy spirit?
c71297	or whither shall I flee from thy presence?
c71298	If I ascend up into heaven,
c71299	thou <i>art</i> there:
c71300	if I make my bed in hell,

c71302	<i>If</i> I take the wings of the morning,
c71303	<i>and</i> dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea;

c71305	me, and thy right hand shall hold me.
c71306	If I say,
c71307	Surely the darkness shall cover
c71308	me; even the night shall be light about me.
c71309	Yea, the darkness hideth not from
c71310	thee; but the night shineth as the day:
c71311	the darkness and the light <i>are</i> both alike <i>to thee.</i>
c71312	For thou hast possessed my reins:
c71313	thou hast covered me in my mother's womb.
c71314	I will praise
c71315	thee; for I am fearfully <i>and</i> wonderfully
c71316	made: marvellous <i>are</i> thy works;
c71317	and <i>that</i> my soul knoweth right well.
c71318	My substance was not hid from
c71319	thee, when I was made in secret,
c71320	<i>and</i> curiously wrought in the lowest parts of the earth.
c71321	Thine eyes did see my substance, yet being unperfect;
c71322	and in thy book all <i>my members</i> were written,
c71323	<i>which</i> in continuance
c71324	were fashioned,
c71325	when <i>as yet there was</i> none of them.
c71328	How precious also are thy thoughts

c71330	how great is the sum of them!
c71331	<i>If</i> I should count

c71748	unto him. Praise ye the LORD.
c71749	Praise ye the LORD.
c71750	Sing unto the LORD a new song,
c71751	<i>and</i> his praise in the congregation of saints.
c71752	Let Israel rejoice in him that made
c71753	him: let the children of Zion be joyful in their King.
c71754	Let them praise his name in the dance:
c71755	let them sing praises unto him with the timbrel and harp.
c71756	For the LORD taketh pleasure in his people:
c71757	he will beautify the meek with salvation.
c71758	Let the saints be joyful in glory:
c71759	let them sing aloud upon their beds.
c71760	<i>Let</i> the high <i>praises</i> of God <i>be</i> in their mouth,
c71761	and a twoedged sword in their hand;
c71762	To execute vengeance upon the heathen,
c71763	<i>and</i> punishments
c71764	upon the people;
c71765	To bind their kings with chains,
c71766	and their nobles with fetters of iron;
c71767	To execute upon them the judgment written:
c71768	this honour have all his saints.
c71769	Praise ye the LORD.
c71770	Praise ye the LORD.
c71771	Praise God in his sanctuary:
c71772	praise him in the firmament of his power.
c71773	Praise him for his mighty acts:
c71774	praise him according to his excellent greatness.
c71775	Praise him with the sound of the trumpet:
c71776	praise him with the psaltery and harp.
c71777	Praise him with the timbrel and dance:
c71778	praise him with stringed instruments and organs.
c71779	Praise him upon the loud cymbals:
c71780	praise him upon the high sounding cymbals.
c71781	Let every thing that hath breath praise the LORD.
c71782	Praise ye the LORD.
c71783	There was a man in the land of Uz,
c71784	whose name <i>was</i> Job;
c71785	and that man was perfect and upright, and one that feared God,
c71786	and eschewed evil.
c71787	And there were born unto him seven sons and three daughters.
c71788	His substance also was seven thousand sheep, and three thousand camels, and five hundred yoke of oxen, and five hundred she asses,
c71789	and a very great household;
c71790	so that this man was the greatest of all the men of the east.
c71791	And his sons went
c71792	and feasted <i>in their</i> houses, every one his day;
c71793	and sent
c71794	and called for their three sisters
c71795	to eat
c71796	and to drink with them.
c71797	And it was
c71798	so, when the days of <i>their</i> feasting were gone about,
c71799	that Job sent
c71800	and sanctified
c71801	them, and rose up early in the morning,
c71802	and offered burnt offerings <i>according</i> to the number of them all:
c71803	for Job said,
c71804	It may be that my sons have sinned,
c71805	and cursed God in their hearts.
c71806	Thus did Job continually.
c71807	Now there was a day
c71808	when the sons of God came
c71809	to present themselves before the LORD,
c71810	and Satan came also among them.
c71811	And the LORD said unto Satan,
c71812	Whence comest
c71813	thou? Then Satan answered the LORD,
c71814	and said,
c71815	From going to and fro in the earth,
c71816	and from walking up and down in it.
c71817	And the LORD said unto Satan,
c71818	Hast thou considered my servant Job,
c71819	that <i>there is</i> none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man,
c71820	one that feareth God,
c71821	and escheweth evil?
c71822	Then Satan answered the LORD,
c71823	and said,
c71824	Doth Job fear God for nought?
c71825	Hast not thou made an hedge about him, and about his house, and about all
c71826	that
c71827	he hath on every side?
c71828	thou hast blessed the work of his hands,
c71829	and his substance is increased in the land.
c71830	But put forth thine hand now,
c71831	and touch all
c71832	that
c71833	he hath, and he will curse thee to thy face.
c71834	And the LORD said unto Satan,
c71835	Behold, all
c71836	that
c71837	he hath <i>is</i> in thy power;
c71838	only upon himself put not forth thine hand.
c71839	So Satan went forth from the presence of the LORD.
c71840	And there was a day
c71841	when his sons and his daughters <i>were</i> eating
c71842	and drinking wine in their eldest brother's house:
c71843	And there came a messenger unto Job,
c71844	and said,
c71845	The oxen were plowing,
c71846	and the asses feeding beside them:
c71847	And the Sabeans fell
c71848	<i>upon them,</i> and took them away;
c71849	yea, they have slain the servants with the edge of the sword;
c71850	and I only am escaped alone
c71851	to tell thee.
c71852	While he <i>was</i> yet speaking,
c71853	there came also another,
c71854	and said,
c71855	The fire of God is fallen from heaven,
c71856	and hath burned up the sheep, and the servants,
c71857	and consumed
c71858	them; and I only am escaped alone
c71859	to tell thee.
c71860	While he <i>was</i> yet speaking,
c71861	there came also another,
c71862	and said,
c71863	The Chaldeans made out three bands,
c71864	and fell upon the camels,
c71865	and have carried them away,
c71866	yea, and slain the servants with the edge of the sword;
c71867	and I only am escaped alone
c71868	to tell thee.
c71869	While he <i>was</i> yet speaking,
c71870	there came also another,
c71871	and said,
c71872	Thy sons and thy daughters <i>were</i> eating
c71873	and drinking wine in their eldest brother's house:
c71874	And, behold,
c71875	there came a great wind from the wilderness,
c71876	and smote the four corners of the house,
c71877	and it fell upon the young men,
c71878	and they are dead;
c71879	and I only am escaped alone
c71880	to tell thee.
c71881	Then Job arose,
c71882	and rent his mantle,
c71883	and shaved his head,
c71884	and fell down upon the ground,
c71885	and worshipped,
c71886	And said,
c71887	Naked came I out of my mother's womb,
c71888	and naked shall I return thither:
c71889	the LORD gave,
c71890	and the LORD hath taken away;
c71891	blessed be the name of the LORD.
c71892	In all this Job sinned not,
c71893	nor charged God foolishly.
c71894	Again there was a day
c71895	when the sons of God came
c71896	to present themselves before the LORD,
c71897	and Satan came also among
c71898	them to present himself before the LORD.
c71899	And the LORD said unto Satan,
c71900	From whence comest
c71901	thou? And Satan answered the LORD,
c71902	and said,
c71903	From going to and fro in the earth,
c71904	and from walking up and down in it.
c71905	And the LORD said unto Satan,
c71906	Hast thou considered my servant Job,
c71907	that <i>there is</i> none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man,
c71908	one that feareth God,
c71909	and escheweth evil?
c71910	and still he holdeth fast his integrity,
c71911	although thou movedst
c71912	me against him, to destroy him without cause.
c71913	And Satan answered the LORD,
c71914	and said,
c71915	Skin for skin,
c71916	yea, all
c71917	that a man
c71918	hath will he give for his life.
c71919	But put forth thine hand now,
c71920	and touch his bone and his flesh, and he will curse thee to
c71921	thy face.
c71922	And the LORD said unto Satan,
c71923	Behold, he <i>is</i> in thine hand;
c71924	but save his life.
c71925	So went Satan forth from the presence of the LORD,
c71926	and smote Job with sore boils from the sole of his foot unto his crown.
c71927	And he took him a potsherd
c71928	to scrape himself
c71929	withal; and he sat down among the ashes.
c71930	Then said his wife
c71931	unto him, Dost thou still retain thine integrity?
c71932	curse God,
c71933	and die.
c71934	But he said unto
c71935	her, Thou speakest as one of the foolish women
c71936	speaketh.
c71937	What? shall we receive good at the hand of God,
c71938	and shall we not receive evil?
c71939	In all this did not Job sin with his lips.
c71940	Now when Job's three friends heard of all this evil
c71941	that was come upon
c71942	him, they came
c71943	every one from his own place;
c71944	Eliphaz the Temanite, and Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite:
c71945	for they had made an appointment together
c71946	to come
c71947	to mourn
c71948	with him and to comfort him.
c71949	And when they lifted up their eyes afar off,
c71950	and knew him not,
c71951	they lifted up their voice,
c71952	and wept;
c71953	and they rent every one his mantle,
c71954	and sprinkled dust upon their heads toward heaven.
c71955	So they sat down with him upon the ground seven days and seven nights,
c71956	and none spake a word unto
c71957	him: for they saw
c71958	that <i>his</i> grief was very great.
c71959	After this opened Job his mouth,
c71960	and cursed his day.
c71961	And Job spake,
c71962	and said,
c71963	Let the day perish
c71964	wherein I was born,
c71965	and the night
c71966	<i>in which</i> it was said,
c71967	There is a man child conceived.
c71968	Let that day be darkness;
c71969	let not God regard it from above,
c71970	neither let the light shine upon it.
c71971	Let darkness and the shadow of death stain
c71972	it; let a cloud dwell upon
c71973	it; let the blackness of the day terrify it.
c71974	As <i>for</i> that night,
c71975	let darkness seize upon
c71976	it; let it not be joined unto the days of the year,
c71977	let it not come into the number of the months.
c71978	Lo,
c71979	let that night be solitary,
c71980	let no joyful voice come therein.
c71981	Let them curse it that curse the day,
c71982	who are ready
c71983	to raise up their mourning.
c71984	Let the stars of the twilight thereof be dark;
c71985	let it look for light,
c71986	but <i>have</i> none;
c71987	neither let it see the dawning of the day:
c71988	Because it shut not up the doors of my <i>mother's</i> womb,
c71989	nor hid sorrow from mine eyes.
c71990	Why died I not from the womb?
c71991	when I came out of the belly?
c71992	<i>why</i> did I <i>not</i> give up the ghost
c71993	Why did the knees prevent
c71994	me? or why the breasts
c71995	that I should suck?
c71996	For now should I have lain still
c71997	and been quiet,
c71998	I should have slept:
c71999	then had I been at rest,
c72000	With kings and counsellors of the earth,
c72001	which built desolate places for themselves;
c72002	Or with princes
c72003	that had gold,
c72004	who filled their houses with silver:
c72005	Or as an hidden untimely birth I had not been;
c72006	as infants
c72007	<i>which</i> never saw light.
c72008	There the wicked cease <i>from</i> troubling;
c72009	and there the weary be at rest.
c72010	<i>There</i> the prisoners rest together;
c72011	they hear not the voice of the oppressor.
c72012	The small and great are there;
c72013	and the servant <i>is</i> free from his master.
c72014	Wherefore is light given to him that is in misery,
c72015	and life unto the bitter <i>in</i> soul;
c72016	Which long for death,
c72017	but it <i>cometh</i> not;
c72018	and dig for it more than for hid treasures;
c72019	Which rejoice exceedingly,
c72020	<i>and</i> are glad,
c72021	when they can find the grave?
c72022	<i>Why is light given</i> to a man
c72023	whose way is hid,
c72024	and whom God hath hedged in?
c72025	For my sighing cometh before I eat,
c72026	and my roarings are poured out like the waters.
c72027	For the thing which I greatly feared
c72028	is come upon
c72030	me, and that which I was afraid of
c72031	is come unto me.
c72032	I was not in safety,
c72033	neither had I rest,
c72034	neither was I quiet;
c72035	yet trouble came.
c72036	Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered
c72037	and said,
c72038	<i>If</i> we assay to commune with
c72039	thee, wilt thou be grieved?
c72041	withhold himself from speaking?
c72042	but who can
c72043	Behold,
c72044	thou hast instructed many,
c72045	and thou hast strengthened the weak hands.
c72046	Thy words have upholden him that was falling,
c72047	and thou hast strengthened the feeble knees.
c72048	But now it is come upon
c72049	thee, and thou faintest;
c72050	it toucheth
c72051	thee, and thou art troubled.
c72052	<i>Is</i> not <i>this</i> thy fear, thy confidence,
c72053	thy hope, and the uprightness of thy ways?
c72054	Remember, I pray thee,
c72055	who
c72056	being innocent?
c72057	<i>ever</i> perished,
c72058	or where were the righteous cut off?
c72059	Even as I have seen,
c72060	they that plow iniquity, and sow wickedness, reap the same.
c72061	By the blast of God they perish,
c72062	and by the breath of his nostrils are they consumed.
c72063	The roaring of the lion, and the voice of the fierce lion, and the teeth of the young lions, are broken.
c72064	The old lion perisheth for lack of prey,
c72065	and the stout lion's whelps are scattered abroad.
c72066	Now a thing was secretly brought to
c72067	me, and mine ear received a little thereof.
c72068	In thoughts from the visions of the night,
c72069	when deep sleep falleth on men,
c72070	Fear came upon
c72071	me, and trembling,
c72072	which made all my bones to shake.
c72073	Then a spirit passed before my face;
c72074	the hair of my flesh stood up:
c72075	It stood still,
c72076	but I could not discern the form
c72077	thereof: an image <i>was</i> before mine eyes,
c72078	<i>there was</i> silence,
c72079	and I heard a voice, <i>saying,</i>
c72080	Shall mortal man be more just than God?
c72081	shall a man be more pure than his maker?
c72082	Behold,
c72083	he put no trust in his servants;
c72084	and his angels he charged with folly:
c72085	How much less <i>in</i> them that dwell in houses of clay,
c72086	whose foundation <i>is</i> in the dust,
c72087	<i>which</i> are crushed before the moth?
c72088	They are destroyed from morning to evening:
c72089	they perish for ever without any regarding <i>it.</i>
c72090	Doth not their excellency <i>which is</i> in them go away?
c72091	they die,
c72092	even without wisdom.
c72093	Call now,
c72094	if there be any that will answer
c72095	thee; and to which of the saints wilt thou turn?
c72096	For wrath killeth the foolish
c72097	man, and envy slayeth the silly one.
c72098	I have seen the foolish
c72099	taking root:
c72100	but suddenly I cursed his habitation.
c72101	His children are far from safety,
c72102	and they are crushed in the gate,
c72103	neither <i>is there</i> any to deliver <i>them.</i>
c72104	Whose harvest
c72105	the hungry eateth up,
c72106	and taketh it even out of the thorns,
c72107	and the robber swalloweth up their substance.
c72108	Although affliction cometh not forth of the dust,
c72109	neither doth trouble spring out of the ground;
c72110	Yet man is born unto trouble,
c72111	as the sparks fly upward.
c72113	I would seek unto God,
c72114	and unto God would I commit my cause:
c72115	Which doeth great things
c72116	and unsearchable;
c72117	marvellous things without number:
c72118	Who giveth rain upon the earth,
c72119	and sendeth waters upon the fields:
c72120	To set up on high those that be low;
c72121	that those which mourn may be exalted to safety.
c72122	He disappointeth the devices of the crafty,
c72123	so that their hands cannot perform <i>their</i> enterprise.
c72124	He taketh the wise in their own craftiness:
c72125	and the counsel of the froward is carried headlong.
c72126	They meet with darkness in the daytime,
c72127	and grope in the noonday as in the night.
c72128	But he saveth the poor from the sword, from their mouth,
c72129	and from the hand of the mighty.
c72130	So the poor hath hope,
c72131	and iniquity stoppeth her mouth.
c72132	Behold, happy <i>is</i> the man
c72133	whom God correcteth:
c72134	therefore despise not thou the chastening of the Almighty:
c72135	For he maketh sore,
c72136	and bindeth up:
c72137	he woundeth,
c72138	and his hands make whole.
c72139	He shall deliver thee in six troubles:
c72140	yea, in seven there shall no evil touch thee.
c72141	In famine he shall redeem thee from death:
c72142	and in war from the power of the sword.
c72143	Thou shalt be hid from the scourge of the tongue:
c72144	neither shalt thou be afraid of destruction
c72145	when it cometh.
c72146	At destruction and famine thou shalt laugh:
c72147	neither shalt thou be afraid of the beasts of the earth.
c72148	For thou shalt be in league with the stones of the field:
c72149	and the beasts of the field shall be at peace with thee.
c72150	And thou shalt know
c72151	that thy tabernacle <i>shall be</i> in peace;
c72152	and thou shalt visit thy habitation,
c72153	and shalt not sin.
c72154	Thou shalt know
c72155	also that thy seed <i>shall be</i> great,
c72156	and thine offspring as the grass of the earth.
c72157	Thou shalt come to <i>thy</i> grave in a full age,
c72158	like as a shock of corn cometh in in his season.
c72159	Lo this,
c72160	we have searched
c72161	it, so it
c72162	<i>is;</i> hear
c72163	it, and know thou <i>it</i> for thy good.
c72164	But Job answered
c72165	and said,
c72166	Oh that my grief were throughly weighed,
c72167	and my calamity laid in the balances together!
c72168	For now it would be heavier than the sand of the sea:
c72169	therefore my words are swallowed up.
c72170	For the arrows of the Almighty <i>are</i> within
c72171	me, the poison whereof drinketh up my spirit:
c72172	the terrors of God do set themselves in array against me.
c72173	Doth the wild ass bray when he hath grass? or loweth the ox over
c72174	his fodder?
c72175	Can that which is unsavoury be eaten without salt?
c72176	or is there <i>any</i> taste in the white of an egg?
c72177	refused
c72178	to touch <i>are</i> as my sorrowful meat.
c72180	The things <i>that</i> my soul
c72181	Oh that I might
c72182	have my request;
c72183	and that God would grant <i>me</i> the thing that I long for!
c72184	Even that it would please God
c72185	to destroy
c72186	me; that he would let loose his hand,
c72187	and cut me off!
c72188	Then should I yet have comfort;
c72189	yea, I would harden myself in sorrow:
c72190	let him not spare;
c72191	for I have not concealed the words of the Holy One.
c72192	What <i>is</i> my strength,
c72193	that I should hope?
c72194	and what <i>is</i> mine end,
c72195	that I should prolong my life?
c72196	<i>Is</i> my strength the strength of stones?
c72197	or <i>is</i> my flesh of brass?
c72198	<i>Is</i> not my help
c72199	in me? and is wisdom driven quite from me?
c72200	To him that is afflicted pity <i>should be shewed</i> from his friend;
c72201	but he forsaketh the fear of the Almighty.
c72202	My brethren have dealt deceitfully as a brook,
c72203	<i>and</i> as the stream of brooks they pass away;
c72204	Which are blackish by reason of the ice,
c72205	<i>and</i> wherein the snow is hid:
c72206	What time
c72207	they wax warm,
c72208	they vanish:
c72209	when it is hot,
c72210	they are consumed out of their place.
c72211	The paths of their way are turned aside;
c72212	they go to nothing,
c72213	and perish.
c72214	The troops of Tema looked,
c72215	the companies of Sheba waited for them.
c72216	They were confounded
c72217	because they had hoped;
c72218	they came thither,
c72219	and were ashamed.
c72220	For now ye are nothing;
c72221	ye see <i>my</i> casting down,
c72222	and are afraid.
c72223	Did I say,
c72224	Bring
c72225	unto me? or, Give a reward for me of your substance?
c72226	Or, Deliver me from the enemy's hand?
c72227	or, Redeem me from the hand of the mighty?
c72228	Teach
c72229	me, and I will hold my tongue:
c72231	wherein I have erred.
c72232	and cause me to understand
c72233	How forcible are right words!
c72234	but what doth your arguing reprove?
c72236	to reprove words,
c72237	Do ye imagine
c72238	and the speeches of one that is desperate, <i>which are</i> as wind?
c72239	Yea, ye overwhelm the fatherless,
c72240	and ye dig <i>a pit</i> for your friend.
c72241	Now
c72242	therefore be content,
c72243	look
c72244	upon me; for <i>it is</i> evident unto
c72245	you if I lie.
c72246	Return, I pray you,
c72247	let it not be iniquity;
c72248	yea, return
c72249	again, my righteousness <i>is</i> in it.
c72250	Is there iniquity in my tongue?
c72251	cannot my taste discern perverse things?
c72252	<i>Is there</i> not an appointed time to man upon earth?
c72253	<i>are not</i> his days also like the days of an hireling?
c72254	As a servant
c72255	earnestly desireth the shadow,
c72256	and as an hireling
c72257	looketh for <i>the reward of</i> his work:
c72258	So am I made to possess months of vanity,
c72259	and wearisome nights are appointed to me.
c72260	When I lie down,
c72261	I say,
c72262	When shall I arise,
c72263	and the night be gone?
c72264	and I am full of tossings to and fro unto the dawning of the day.
c72265	My flesh is clothed with worms and clods of dust;
c72266	my skin is broken,
c72267	and become loathsome.
c72268	My days are swifter than a weaver's shuttle,
c72269	and are spent without hope.
c72270	O remember
c72271	that my life <i>is</i> wind:
c72272	mine eye shall no more
c72273	see good.
c72274	The eye of him that hath seen me shall see me no
c72276	<i>more:</i> thine eyes
c72277	<i>are</i> upon me, and I <i>am</i> not.
c72278	<i>As</i> the cloud is consumed
c72279	and vanisheth away:
c72280	so
c72281	he that goeth down to the grave
c72282	shall come up no <i>more.</i>
c72283	He shall return no more to his house,
c72284	neither shall his place know him any more.
c72285	Therefore I will not refrain my mouth;
c72286	I will speak in the anguish of my spirit;
c72287	I will complain in the bitterness of my soul.
c72288	<i>Am</i> I a sea,
c72289	or a whale,
c72290	that thou settest a watch over me?
c72291	When I say,
c72292	My bed shall comfort
c72293	me, my couch shall ease my complaint;
c72294	Then thou scarest me with dreams,
c72295	and terrifiest me through visions:
c72296	So that my soul chooseth strangling,
c72297	<i>and</i> death rather than my life.
c72298	I loathe
c72299	<i>it;</i> I would not live alway:
c72300	let me alone;
c72301	for my days <i>are</i> vanity.
c72302	What <i>is</i> man,
c72303	that thou shouldest magnify
c72304	him? and that thou shouldest set thine heart upon him?
c72305	And <i>that</i> thou shouldest visit him every morning,
c72306	<i>and</i> try him every moment?
c72307	How long wilt thou not depart from
c72308	me, nor let me alone
c72309	till I swallow down my spittle?
c72310	I have sinned;
c72311	what shall I do
c72312	unto thee, O thou preserver of men?
c72313	why hast thou set me as a mark
c72314	against thee, so that I am a burden to myself?
c72315	And why dost thou not pardon my transgression,
c72316	and take away mine iniquity?
c72317	for now shall I sleep in the dust;
c72318	and thou shalt seek me in the morning,
c72319	but I <i>shall</i> not <i>be.</i>
c72320	Then answered Bildad the Shuhite,
c72321	and said,
c72322	How long wilt thou speak these
c72323	<i>things?</i> and <i>how long shall</i> the words of thy mouth <i>be like</i> a strong wind?
c72324	Doth God pervert judgment?
c72325	or doth the Almighty pervert justice?
c72326	If thy children have sinned
c72327	against him, and he have cast them away for their transgression;
c72328	If thou wouldest seek unto God betimes,
c72329	and make thy supplication to the Almighty;
c72330	If thou <i>wert</i> pure and upright;
c72331	surely now he would awake for
c72332	thee, and make the habitation of thy righteousness prosperous.
c72333	Though thy beginning was small,
c72334	yet thy latter end should greatly increase.
c72335	For enquire, I pray thee, of the former age,
c72336	and prepare thyself to the search of their fathers:
c72337	(For we <i>are but of</i> yesterday,
c72338	and know nothing,
c72339	because our days upon earth <i>are</i> a shadow:)
c72340	Shall not they teach
c72341	thee, <i>and</i> tell
c72342	thee, and utter words out of their heart?
c72343	Can the rush grow up without mire?
c72344	can the flag grow without water?
c72345	Whilst it <i>is</i> yet in his greenness,
c72346	<i>and</i> not cut down,
c72347	it withereth before any <i>other</i> herb.
c72348	So <i>are</i> the paths of all that forget God;
c72349	and the hypocrite's hope shall perish:
c72350	Whose hope shall be cut off,
c72351	and whose trust <i>shall be</i> a spider's web.
c72352	He shall lean upon his house,
c72353	but it shall not stand:
c72354	he shall hold it fast,
c72355	but it shall not endure.
c72356	He <i>is</i> green before the sun,
c72357	and his branch shooteth forth in his garden.
c72358	His roots are wrapped about the heap,
c72359	<i>and</i> seeth the place of stones.
c72360	If he destroy him from his place,
c72361	then <i>it</i> shall deny
c72362	him, <i>saying,</i> I have not seen thee.
c72363	Behold, this <i>is</i> the joy of his way,
c72364	and out of the earth shall others grow.
c72365	Behold,
c72366	God will not cast away a perfect
c72367	<i>man,</i> neither will he help the evil doers:
c72368	Till he fill thy mouth with laughing,
c72369	and thy lips with rejoicing.
c72370	They that hate thee shall be clothed with shame;
c72371	and the dwelling place of the wicked
c72372	shall come to nought.
c72373	Then Job answered
c72374	and said,
c72375	I know <i>it is</i> so of a truth:
c72377	but how should man be just with God?
c72378	If he will
c72379	contend with
c72380	him, he cannot answer him one of a thousand.
c72381	<i>He is</i> wise in heart, and mighty in strength:
c72382	who hath hardened <i>himself</i> against
c72383	him, and hath prospered?
c72384	Which removeth the mountains,
c72385	and they know not:
c72386	which overturneth them in his anger.
c72387	Which shaketh the earth out of her place,
c72388	and the pillars thereof tremble.
c72389	Which commandeth the sun,
c72390	and it riseth not;
c72391	and sealeth up the stars.
c72392	Which alone spreadeth out the heavens,
c72393	and treadeth upon the waves of the sea.
c72394	Which maketh Arcturus, Orion, and Pleiades, and the chambers of the south.
c72395	Which doeth great things past finding out;
c72396	yea, and wonders without number.
c72397	Lo, he goeth by
c72398	me, and I see <i>him</i> not:
c72399	he passeth on
c72400	also, but I perceive him not.
c72401	Behold, he taketh away,
c72402	who can hinder
c72403	him? who will say unto
c72404	him, What doest thou?
c72405	<i>If</i> God will not withdraw his anger,
c72406	the proud helpers do stoop under him.
c72407	How much less shall I answer
c72408	him, <i>and</i> choose out my words <i>to reason</i> with him?
c72409	Whom,
c72410	though I were righteous,
c72411	<i>yet</i> would I not answer,
c72412	<i>but</i> I would make supplication to my judge.
c72413	If I had called,
c72414	and he had answered
c72415	me; <i>yet</i> would I not believe
c72416	that he had hearkened unto my voice.
c72417	For he breaketh me with a tempest,
c72418	and multiplieth my wounds without cause.
c72419	He will not suffer
c72420	me to take my breath,
c72421	but filleth me with bitterness.
c72422	If <i>I speak</i> of strength,
c72423	lo, <i>he is</i> strong:
c72424	and if of judgment,
c72425	who shall set me a time <i>to plead?</i>
c72426	If I justify
c72427	myself, mine own mouth shall condemn
c72428	me: <i>if I say,</i> I <i>am</i> perfect,
c72429	it shall also prove me perverse.
c72430	<i>Though</i> I <i>were</i> perfect,
c72431	<i>yet</i> would I not know my soul:
c72432	I would despise my life.
c72433	This <i>is</i> one
c72434	<i>thing,</i> therefore I said
c72435	<i>it,</i> He destroyeth the perfect and the wicked.
c72436	If the scourge slay suddenly,
c72437	he will laugh at the trial of the innocent.
c72438	The earth is given into the hand of the wicked:
c72439	he covereth the faces of the judges
c72440	thereof; if not, where,
c72441	<i>and</i> who <i>is</i> he?
c72442	Now my days are swifter than a post:
c72443	they flee away,
c72444	they see no good.
c72445	They are passed away as the swift ships:
c72446	as the eagle
c72447	<i>that</i> hasteth to the prey.
c72448	If I say,
c72449	I will forget my complaint,
c72450	I will leave off my heaviness,
c72451	and comfort <i>myself:</i>
c72452	I am afraid of all my sorrows,
c72453	I know
c72454	that thou wilt not hold me innocent.
c72455	<i>If</i> I be wicked,
c72456	why then labour I in vain?
c72457	If I wash myself with snow water,
c72458	and make my hands never so clean;
c72459	Yet shalt thou plunge me in the ditch,
c72460	and mine own clothes shall abhor me.
c72461	For <i>he is</i> not a man, as I
c72462	<i>am, that</i> I should answer
c72463	him, <i>and</i> we should come together in judgment.
c72464	Neither is there any daysman betwixt
c72465	us, <i>that</i> might lay his hand upon us both.
c72466	Let him take his rod away from
c72467	me, and let not his fear terrify me:
c72468	<i>Then</i> would I speak,
c72469	and not fear
c72470	him; but <i>it is</i> not so with me.
c72471	My soul is weary of my life;
c72472	I will leave my complaint upon
c72473	myself; I will speak in the bitterness of my soul.
c72474	I will say unto God,
c72475	Do not condemn
c72476	me; shew
c72477	me wherefore thou contendest with me.
c72478	<i>Is it</i> good
c72479	unto thee that thou shouldest oppress,
c72480	that thou shouldest despise the work of thine hands,
c72481	and shine upon the counsel of the wicked?
c72482	Hast thou eyes of flesh?
c72483	or
c72484	seest thou as man
c72485	seeth?
c72486	<i>Are</i> thy days as the days of man?
c72487	<i>are</i> thy years as man's days,
c72488	That thou enquirest after mine iniquity,
c72489	and searchest after my sin?
c72490	Thou knowest
c72491	that I am not wicked;
c72492	and <i>there is</i> none that can deliver out of thine hand.
c72493	Thine hands have made
c72494	me and fashioned
c72495	me together round about;
c72496	yet thou dost destroy me.
c72497	Remember, I beseech thee,
c72498	that thou hast made me as the clay;
c72499	and wilt thou bring me into dust again?
c72500	Hast thou not poured me out as milk,
c72501	and curdled me like cheese?
c72502	Thou hast clothed me with skin and flesh,
c72503	and hast fenced me with bones and sinews.
c72504	Thou hast granted me life and favour,
c72505	and thy visitation hath preserved my spirit.
c72506	And these <i>things</i> hast thou hid in thine heart:
c72507	I know
c72508	that this <i>is</i> with thee.
c72509	If I sin,
c72510	then thou markest
c72511	me, and thou wilt not acquit me from mine iniquity.
c72512	If I be wicked,
c72513	woe
c72514	unto me; and <i>if</i> I be righteous,
c72515	<i>yet</i> will I not lift up my head.
c72516	<i>I am</i> full of confusion;
c72517	therefore see thou mine affliction;
c72518	For it increaseth.
c72519	Thou huntest me as a fierce lion:
c72520	and again
c72521	thou shewest thyself marvellous upon me.
c72522	Thou renewest thy witnesses against
c72523	me, and increasest thine indignation upon me; changes and war <i>are</i> against me.
c72525	Wherefore then hast thou brought me forth out of the womb?
c72526	Oh that I had given up the ghost,
c72527	and no eye had seen me!
c72528	I should have been as though I had not
c72529	been;
c72530	I should have been carried from the womb to the grave.
c72531	<i>Are</i> not my days few?
c72532	cease
c72533	<i>then, and</i> let me alone,
c72534	that I may take comfort a little,
c72535	Before I go
c72536	<i>whence</i> I shall not return,
c72537	<i>even</i> to the land of darkness and the shadow of death;
c72538	A land of darkness, as darkness <i>itself; and</i> of the shadow of death,
c72539	without any order,
c72540	and <i>where</i> the light <i>is</i> as darkness.
c72541	Then answered Zophar the Naamathite,
c72542	and said,
c72543	Should not the multitude of words be answered?
c72544	and should a man full of talk be justified?
c72545	Should thy lies make men hold their peace?
c72546	and when thou mockest,
c72547	shall no man make thee ashamed?
c72548	For thou hast said,
c72549	My doctrine <i>is</i> pure,
c72550	and I am clean in thine eyes.
c72551	But
c72552	oh that God would
c72553	speak,
c72554	and open his lips against thee;
c72555	And that he would shew thee the secrets of wisdom,
c72556	that <i>they are</i> double to that which is!
c72557	Know
c72558	therefore that God exacteth of thee <i>less</i> than thine iniquity <i>deserveth.</i>
c72559	Canst thou by searching find out God?
c72560	canst thou find out the Almighty unto perfection?
c72561	<i>It is</i> as high as heaven;
c72562	what canst thou do?
c72563	deeper than hell;
c72564	what canst thou know?
c72565	The measure thereof <i>is</i> longer than the earth,
c72566	and broader than the sea.
c72567	If he cut off,
c72568	and shut up,
c72569	or gather together,
c72570	then who can hinder him?
c72571	For he knoweth vain men:
c72572	he seeth wickedness
c72573	also; will he not then consider <i>it?</i>
c72574	For vain man would be wise,
c72575	though man be born <i>like</i> a wild ass's colt.
c72576	If thou prepare thine heart,
c72577	and stretch out thine hands toward him;
c72578	If iniquity <i>be</i> in thine hand,
c72579	put it far away,
c72580	and let not wickedness dwell in thy tabernacles.
c72581	For then shalt thou lift up thy face without spot;
c72582	yea, thou shalt be stedfast,
c72583	and shalt not fear:
c72584	Because thou shalt forget <i>thy</i> misery,
c72585	<i>it</i> as waters
c72586	<i>that</i> pass away:
c72587	<i>and</i> remember
c72588	And <i>thine</i> age shall be clearer than the noonday;
c72589	thou shalt shine forth, thou shalt be as the morning.
c72590	And thou shalt be secure,
c72591	because there is hope;
c72592	yea, thou shalt dig
c72593	<i>about thee, and</i> thou shalt take thy rest in safety.
c72594	Also thou shalt lie down,
c72595	and none shall make <i>thee</i> afraid;
c72596	yea, many shall make suit unto thee.
c72597	But the eyes of the wicked shall fail,
c72598	and they shall not escape,
c72599	and their hope <i>shall be as</i> the giving up of the ghost.
c72600	And Job answered
c72601	and said,
c72602	No doubt
c72603	but ye <i>are</i> the people,
c72604	and wisdom shall die with you.
c72605	But I have understanding as well as you;
c72606	I <i>am</i> not inferior to
c72607	you: yea, who knoweth not such things as these?
c72608	I am <i>as</i> one mocked of his neighbour,
c72609	who calleth upon God,
c72610	and he answereth
c72611	him: the just upright <i>man is</i> laughed to scorn.
c72612	<i>is as</i> a lamp despised in the thought of him that is at ease.
c72613	He that is ready to slip with <i>his</i> feet
c72614	The tabernacles of robbers prosper,
c72615	and they that provoke God are secure;
c72616	into whose hand God bringeth <i>abundantly.</i>
c72617	But
c72618	ask now the beasts,
c72619	and they shall teach
c72620	thee; and the fowls of the air,
c72621	and they shall tell thee:
c72622	Or speak to the earth,
c72623	and it shall teach
c72624	thee: and the fishes of the sea shall declare unto thee.
c72625	Who knoweth not in all these
c72626	that the hand of the LORD hath wrought this?
c72627	In whose hand <i>is</i> the soul of every living thing, and the breath of all mankind.
c72628	Doth not the ear try words?
c72629	and the mouth taste his meat?
c72630	With the ancient <i>is</i> wisdom;
c72631	and in length of days understanding.
c72632	With him <i>is</i> wisdom and strength,
c72633	he hath counsel and understanding.
c72634	Behold,
c72635	he breaketh down,
c72636	and it cannot be built again:
c72637	he shutteth up a man,
c72638	and there can be no opening.
c72639	Behold,
c72640	he withholdeth the waters,
c72641	and they dry up:
c72642	also he sendeth them out,
c72643	and they overturn the earth.
c72644	With him <i>is</i> strength and wisdom:
c72645	the deceived and the deceiver <i>are</i> his.
c72646	He leadeth counsellors away spoiled,
c72647	and maketh the judges fools.
c72648	He looseth the bond of kings,
c72649	and girdeth their loins with a girdle.
c72650	He leadeth princes away spoiled,
c72651	and overthroweth the mighty.
c72652	He removeth away the speech of the trusty,
c72653	and taketh away the understanding of the aged.
c72654	He poureth contempt upon princes,
c72655	and weakeneth the strength of the mighty.
c72656	He discovereth deep things out of darkness,
c72657	and bringeth out to light the shadow of death.
c72658	He increaseth the nations,
c72659	and destroyeth
c72660	them: he enlargeth the nations,
c72661	and straiteneth them <i>again.</i>
c72662	He taketh away the heart of the chief of the people of the earth,
c72663	and causeth them to wander in a wilderness
c72664	<i>where there is</i> no way.
c72665	They grope in the dark
c72666	without light,
c72667	and he maketh them to stagger like <i>a</i> drunken <i>man.</i>
c72668	Lo,
c72669	mine eye hath seen all
c72670	<i>this,</i> mine ear hath heard
c72671	and understood it.
c72672	What ye know, <i>the same</i> do I know also:
c72673	I <i>am</i> not inferior unto you.
c72674	Surely
c72675	I would speak to the Almighty,
c72677	to reason with God.
c72678	and I desire
c72679	But
c72680	ye <i>are</i> forgers of lies,
c72681	ye <i>are</i> all physicians of no value.
c72682	O that ye would
c72683	altogether hold your peace!
c72684	and it should be your wisdom.
c72685	Hear now my reasoning,
c72686	and hearken to the pleadings of my lips.
c72687	Will ye speak wickedly for God?
c72688	and talk deceitfully for him?
c72689	Will ye accept his person?
c72690	will ye contend for God?
c72691	Is it good
c72692	that he should search you out?
c72693	or
c72694	as one man mocketh
c72695	another, do ye <i>so</i> mock him?
c72696	He will surely reprove
c72697	you, if ye do secretly accept persons.
c72698	Shall not his excellency make you afraid?
c72699	and his dread fall upon you?
c72700	Your remembrances <i>are</i> like unto ashes,
c72701	your bodies to bodies of clay.
c72702	Hold your peace, let me alone,
c72703	that I may speak,
c72704	and let come on
c72705	me what <i>will.</i>
c72706	Wherefore do I take my flesh in my teeth,
c72707	and put my life in mine hand?
c72708	Though
c72709	he slay
c72710	me, yet will I trust
c72711	in him: but I will maintain mine own ways before him.
c72712	He also <i>shall be</i> my salvation:
c72713	for an hypocrite shall not come before him.
c72714	Hear diligently my speech,
c72715	and my declaration with your ears.
c72716	Behold now,
c72717	I have ordered <i>my</i> cause;
c72718	I know
c72719	that I shall be justified.
c72720	Who <i>is</i> he
c72721	<i>that</i> will plead with
c72722	me? for now, if I hold my tongue,
c72723	I shall give up the ghost.
c72724	Only do not two <i>things</i> unto
c72725	me: then will I not hide myself from thee.
c72726	Withdraw thine hand far from
c72727	me: and let not thy dread make me afraid.
c72728	Then call
c72729	thou, and I will answer:
c72730	or let me speak,
c72731	and answer thou me.
c72732	How many <i>are</i> mine iniquities and sins?
c72733	make me to know my transgression and my sin.
c72734	Wherefore hidest thou thy face,
c72735	and holdest me for thine enemy?
c72736	Wilt thou break a leaf driven to and fro?
c72737	and wilt thou pursue the dry stubble?
c72738	For thou writest bitter things against
c72739	me, and makest me to possess the iniquities of my youth.
c72740	Thou puttest my feet also in the stocks,
c72741	and lookest narrowly unto all my paths;
c72742	thou settest a print upon the heels of my feet.
c72743	And he, as a rotten thing, consumeth,
c72744	as a garment
c72745	that is moth eaten.
c72746	Man <i>that is</i> born of a woman <i>is</i> of few days, and full of trouble.
c72747	He cometh forth like a flower,
c72748	and is cut down:
c72749	he fleeth also as a shadow,
c72750	and continueth not.
c72751	And dost thou open thine eyes upon such an one,
c72752	and bringest me into judgment with thee?
c72753	Who can bring a clean <i>thing</i> out of an unclean?
c72754	not one.
c72755	Seeing his days <i>are</i> determined,
c72756	the number of his months <i>are</i> with
c72757	thee, thou hast appointed his bounds
c72758	that he cannot pass;
c72759	Turn from
c72760	him, that he may rest,
c72761	till he shall accomplish, as an hireling, his day.
c72762	For there is hope of a tree,
c72763	if it be cut down,
c72764	that it will sprout again,
c72765	and that the tender branch thereof will not cease.
c72766	Though the root thereof wax old in the earth,
c72767	and the stock thereof die in the ground;
c72768	<i>Yet</i> through the scent of water it will bud,
c72769	and bring forth boughs like a plant.
c72770	But man dieth,
c72771	and wasteth away:
c72772	yea, man giveth up the ghost,
c72773	and where <i>is</i> he?
c72774	<i>As</i> the waters fail from the sea,
c72775	and the flood decayeth
c72776	and drieth up:
c72777	So man lieth down,
c72778	and riseth not:
c72779	till the heavens <i>be</i> no more, they shall not awake,
c72780	nor be raised out of their sleep.
c72781	O that thou wouldest
c72782	hide me in the grave,
c72783	that thou wouldest keep me secret,
c72784	until thy wrath be past,
c72785	that thou wouldest appoint me a set time,
c72786	and remember me!
c72787	If a man die,
c72788	shall he live
c72789	<i>again?</i> all the days of my appointed time will I wait,
c72790	till my change come.
c72791	Thou shalt call,
c72792	and I will answer
c72793	thee: thou wilt have a desire to the work of thine hands.
c72794	For now thou numberest my steps:
c72795	dost thou not watch over my sin?
c72796	My transgression <i>is</i> sealed up in a bag,
c72797	and thou sewest up mine iniquity.
c72798	And surely
c72799	the mountain falling cometh to nought,
c72800	and the rock is removed out of his place.
c72801	The waters wear the stones:
c72802	thou washest away the things which grow <i>out</i> of the dust of the earth;
c72803	and thou destroyest the hope of man.
c72804	Thou prevailest for ever
c72805	against him, and he passeth:
c72806	thou changest his countenance,
c72807	and sendest him away.
c72808	His sons come to honour,
c72809	and he knoweth <i>it</i> not;
c72810	and they are brought low,
c72811	but he perceiveth <i>it</i> not of them.
c72812	But his flesh upon him shall have pain,
c72813	and his soul within him shall mourn.
c72814	Then answered Eliphaz the Temanite,
c72815	and said,
c72816	Should a wise man utter vain knowledge,
c72817	and fill his belly with the east wind?
c72818	Should he reason with unprofitable talk?
c72820	or with speeches
c72821	wherewith he can do no good?
c72822	Yea, thou castest off fear,
c72823	and restrainest prayer before God.
c72824	For thy mouth uttereth thine iniquity,
c72825	and thou choosest the tongue of the crafty.
c72826	Thine own mouth condemneth
c72827	thee, and not I:
c72828	yea, thine own lips testify against thee.
c72829	<i>Art</i> thou the first man <i>that</i> was born?
c72830	or wast thou made before the hills?
c72831	Hast thou heard the secret of God?
c72832	and dost thou restrain wisdom to thyself?
c72833	What knowest
c72834	thou, that we know not?
c72835	<i>what</i> understandest
c72836	thou, which <i>is</i> not in us?
c72837	With us <i>are</i> both the grayheaded and very aged men,
c72838	much elder than thy father.
c72839	<i>Are</i> the consolations of God small with
c72840	thee? is there any secret thing with thee?
c72841	Why doth thine heart carry thee away?
c72842	and what do thy eyes wink at,
c72843	That thou turnest thy spirit against God,
c72844	and lettest <i>such</i> words go out of thy mouth?
c72845	What <i>is</i> man,
c72846	that he should be clean?
c72847	and <i>he which is</i> born of a woman, that he should be righteous?
c72848	Behold,
c72849	he putteth no trust in his saints;
c72850	yea, the heavens are not clean in his sight.
c72851	How much more abominable
c72852	and filthy <i>is</i> man,
c72853	which drinketh iniquity like water?
c72854	I will shew
c72855	thee, hear
c72856	me; and that <i>which</i> I have seen
c72857	I will declare;
c72858	Which wise men have told
c72859	from their fathers, and have not hid <i>it:</i>
c72860	Unto whom alone the earth was given,
c72861	and no stranger passed among them.
c72862	The wicked man travaileth with pain all <i>his</i> days,
c72863	and the number of years is hidden to the oppressor.
c72864	A dreadful sound <i>is</i> in his ears:
c72865	in prosperity the destroyer shall come upon him.
c72866	He believeth not
c72867	that he shall return out of darkness,
c72868	and he is waited for of the sword.
c72869	He wandereth abroad for bread,
c72870	<i>saying,</i> Where
c72871	<i>is it?</i> he knoweth
c72872	that the day of darkness is ready at his hand.
c72873	Trouble and anguish shall make him afraid;
c72874	they shall prevail against him, as a king
c72875	ready to the battle.
c72876	For he stretcheth out his hand against God,
c72877	and strengtheneth himself against the Almighty.
c72878	He runneth upon him, <i>even</i> on <i>his</i> neck, upon the thick bosses of his bucklers:
c72879	Because he covereth his face with his fatness,
c72880	and maketh collops of fat on <i>his</i> flanks.
c72881	And he dwelleth in desolate cities,
c72882	<i>and</i> in houses which
c72883	no man inhabiteth,
c72884	which are ready to become heaps.
c72885	He shall not be rich,
c72886	neither shall his substance continue,
c72887	neither shall he prolong the perfection thereof upon the earth.
c72888	He shall not depart out of darkness;
c72889	the flame shall dry up his branches,
c72890	and by the breath of his mouth shall he go away.
c72891	Let not him that is deceived trust in vanity:
c72893	for vanity shall be his recompence.
c72894	It shall be accomplished before his time,
c72895	and his branch shall not be green.
c72896	He shall shake off his unripe grape as the vine,
c72897	and shall cast off his flower as the olive.
c72898	For the congregation of hypocrites <i>shall be</i> desolate,
c72899	and fire shall consume the tabernacles of bribery.
c72900	They conceive mischief,
c72901	and bring forth vanity,
c72902	and their belly prepareth deceit.
c72903	Then Job answered
c72904	and said,
c72905	I have heard many such things:
c72906	miserable comforters <i>are</i> ye all.
c72907	Shall vain words have an end?
c72908	or what emboldeneth
c72909	thee that thou answerest?
c72910	I also could speak
c72911	as ye <i>do:</i> if your soul were in my soul's stead,
c72912	I could heap up words against
c72913	you, and shake mine head at you.
c72914	<i>But</i> I would strengthen you with my mouth,
c72915	and the moving of my lips should asswage <i>your grief.</i>
c72916	Though I speak,
c72917	my grief is not asswaged:
c72918	and <i>though</i> I forbear,
c72919	what am I eased?
c72920	But now he hath made me weary:
c72921	thou hast made desolate all my company.
c72922	And thou hast filled me with wrinkles,
c72923	<i>which</i> is a witness
c72924	<i>against me:</i> and my leanness rising up
c72925	in me beareth witness to my face.
c72926	He teareth <i>me</i> in his wrath,
c72927	who hateth
c72928	me: he gnasheth upon me with his teeth;
c72929	mine enemy sharpeneth his eyes upon me.
c72930	They have gaped upon me with their mouth;
c72931	they have smitten me upon the cheek reproachfully;
c72932	they have gathered themselves together against me.
c72933	God hath delivered me to the ungodly,
c72934	and turned me over into the hands of the wicked.
c72935	I was at ease,
c72936	but he hath broken me asunder:
c72937	he hath also taken <i>me</i> by my neck,
c72938	and shaken me to pieces,
c72939	and set me up for his mark.
c72940	His archers compass me round about,
c72941	he cleaveth my reins
c72942	asunder, and doth not spare;
c72943	he poureth out my gall upon the ground.
c72944	He breaketh me with breach upon breach,
c72945	he runneth upon me like a giant.
c72946	I have sewed sackcloth upon my skin,
c72947	and defiled my horn in the dust.
c72948	My face is foul with weeping,
c72949	and on my eyelids <i>is</i> the shadow of death;
c72950	Not for <i>any</i> injustice in mine hands:
c72951	also my prayer <i>is</i> pure.
c72952	O earth,
c72953	cover not thou my blood,
c72954	and let my cry have no place.
c72955	Also now,
c72956	behold,
c72957	my witness <i>is</i> in heaven,
c72958	and my record <i>is</i> on high.
c72959	My friends scorn
c72960	me: <i>but</i> mine eye poureth out <i>tears</i> unto God.
c72961	O that one might plead for a man with God,
c72962	as a man <i>pleadeth</i> for his neighbour!
c72963	When a few years are come,
c72964	the way
c72965	<i>whence</i> I shall not return.
c72966	then I shall go
c72967	My breath is corrupt,
c72968	my days are extinct,
c72969	the graves <i>are ready</i> for me.
c72970	<i>Are there</i> not mockers with
c72972	in their provocation?
c72973	me? and doth not mine eye continue
c72974	Lay down now,
c72975	put me in a surety with
c72976	thee; who <i>is</i> he
c72977	<i>that</i> will strike hands with me?
c72978	For thou hast hid their heart from understanding:
c72979	therefore shalt thou not exalt <i>them.</i>
c72980	He that speaketh flattery to <i>his</i> friends,
c72981	even the eyes of his children shall fail.
c72982	He hath made
c72983	me also a byword of the people;
c72984	and aforetime I was as a tabret.
c72985	Mine eye also is dim by reason of sorrow,
c72987	and all my members <i>are</i> as a shadow.
c72988	Upright <i>men</i> shall be astonied at this,
c72989	and the innocent shall stir up himself against the hypocrite.
c72990	The righteous also shall hold on his way,
c72991	and he that hath clean hands shall be stronger and stronger.
c72992	But
c72993	as for you all, do ye return,
c72994	and come now:
c72995	for I cannot find <i>one</i> wise <i>man</i> among you.
c72996	My days are past,
c72997	my purposes are broken off,
c72998	<i>even</i> the thoughts of my heart.
c72999	They change the night into day:
c73000	the light <i>is</i> short because of darkness.
c73001	If I wait, the grave <i>is</i> mine house:
c73002	I have made my bed in the darkness.
c73003	I have said to corruption,
c73004	Thou <i>art</i> my father:
c73005	<i>Thou art</i> my mother,
c73006	and my sister.
c73007	to the worm,
c73008	And where <i>is</i> now my hope?
c73009	as for my hope,
c73010	who shall see it?
c73011	They shall go down to the bars of the pit,
c73012	when <i>our</i> rest together <i>is</i> in the dust.
c73013	Then answered Bildad the Shuhite,
c73014	and said,
c73015	How long <i>will it be ere</i> ye make an end of words?
c73016	mark,
c73017	and afterwards we will speak.
c73018	Wherefore are we counted as beasts,
c73019	<i>and</i> reputed vile in your sight?
c73020	He teareth himself in his anger:
c73021	shall the earth be forsaken for
c73022	thee? and shall the rock be removed out of his place?
c73023	Yea, the light of the wicked shall be put out,
c73024	and the spark of his fire shall not shine.
c73025	The light shall be dark in his tabernacle,
c73026	and his candle shall be put out with him.
c73027	The steps of his strength shall be straitened,
c73028	and his own counsel shall cast him down.
c73029	For he is cast into a net by his own feet,
c73030	and he walketh upon a snare.
c73031	The gin shall take <i>him</i> by the heel,
c73032	<i>and</i> the robber shall prevail against him.
c73033	The snare <i>is</i> laid for him in the ground,
c73034	and a trap for him in the way.
c73035	Terrors shall make him afraid on every side,
c73036	and shall drive him to his feet.
c73037	His strength shall be hungerbitten,
c73038	and destruction <i>shall be</i> ready at his side.
c73039	It shall devour the strength of his skin:
c73040	<i>even</i> the firstborn of death shall devour his strength.
c73041	His confidence shall be rooted out of his tabernacle,
c73042	and it shall bring him to the king of terrors.
c73043	It shall dwell in his tabernacle,
c73044	because <i>it is</i> none
c73045	of his: brimstone shall be scattered upon his habitation.
c73046	His roots shall be dried up beneath,
c73047	and above shall his branch be cut off.
c73048	His remembrance shall perish from the earth,
c73049	and he shall have no name in the street.
c73050	He shall be driven from light into darkness,
c73051	and chased out of the world.
c73052	He shall neither have son
c73053	nor nephew among his people,
c73054	nor any remaining in his dwellings.
c73055	They that come after <i>him</i> shall be astonied at his day,
c73056	as they that went before were affrighted.
c73057	Surely such <i>are</i> the dwellings of the wicked,
c73058	and this <i>is</i> the place
c73059	<i>of him that</i> knoweth not God.
c73060	Then Job answered
c73061	and said,
c73062	How long will ye vex my soul,
c73063	and break me in pieces with words?
c73064	These ten times have ye reproached
c73065	me: ye are not ashamed
c73066	<i>that</i> ye make yourselves strange to me.
c73067	And be it indeed <i>that</i> I have erred,
c73068	mine error remaineth with myself.
c73069	If indeed ye will magnify <i>yourselves</i> against
c73070	me, and plead against me my reproach:
c73071	Know now
c73072	that God hath overthrown
c73073	me, and hath compassed me with his net.
c73074	Behold, I cry out
c73075	of wrong,
c73076	but I am not heard:
c73077	I cry aloud,
c73078	but <i>there is</i> no judgment.
c73079	He hath fenced up my way
c73080	that I cannot pass,
c73081	and he hath set darkness in my paths.
c73082	He hath stripped me of my glory,
c73083	and taken the crown <i>from</i> my head.
c73084	He hath destroyed me on every side,
c73085	and I am gone:
c73086	and mine hope hath he removed like a tree.
c73087	He hath also kindled his wrath against
c73088	me, and he counteth me unto him as <i>one of</i> his enemies.
c73089	His troops come together,
c73090	and raise up their way against
c73091	me, and encamp round about my tabernacle.
c73092	He hath put my brethren far from
c73093	me, and mine acquaintance are verily estranged from me.
c73094	My kinsfolk have failed,
c73095	and my familiar friends have forgotten me.
c73096	They that dwell in mine house, and my maids, count me for a stranger:
c73097	I am an alien in their sight.
c73098	I called my servant,
c73099	and he gave <i>me</i> no answer;
c73100	I intreated him with my mouth.
c73101	My breath is strange to my wife,
c73102	though I intreated for the children's <i>sake</i> of mine own body.
c73103	Yea, young children despised
c73104	me; I arose,
c73105	and they spake against me.
c73106	All my inward friends abhorred
c73107	me: and they whom I loved
c73108	are turned against me.
c73109	My bone cleaveth to my skin and to my flesh,
c73110	and I am escaped with the skin of my teeth.
c73111	Have pity upon
c73112	me, have pity upon
c73113	me, O ye my friends;
c73114	for the hand of God hath touched me.
c73115	Why do ye persecute me as God,
c73116	and are not satisfied with my flesh?
c73117	Oh that my words were now
c73118	written!
c73119	oh that they were printed in a book!
c73121	That they were graven with an iron pen and lead in the rock for ever!
c73122	For I know
c73123	<i>that</i> my redeemer liveth,
c73124	and <i>that</i> he shall stand at the latter <i>day</i> upon the earth:
c73125	And <i>though</i> after my skin <i>worms</i> destroy this
c73126	<i>body,</i> yet in my flesh shall I see God:
c73127	Whom I shall see
c73128	for myself, and mine eyes shall behold,
c73129	and not another;
c73130	<i>though</i> my reins be consumed within me.
c73131	But ye should say,
c73132	Why persecute
c73133	we him, seeing the root of the matter is found in me?
c73134	Be ye afraid of the sword:
c73135	for wrath <i>bringeth</i> the punishments of the sword,
c73136	that ye may know <i>there is</i> a judgment.
c73137	Then answered Zophar the Naamathite,
c73138	and said,
c73139	Therefore do my thoughts cause me to answer,
c73140	and for <i>this</i> I make haste.
c73141	I have heard the check of my reproach,
c73142	and the spirit of my understanding causeth me to answer.
c73143	Knowest thou <i>not</i> this of old,
c73144	since man was placed upon earth,
c73145	That the triumphing of the wicked <i>is</i> short,
c73146	and the joy of the hypocrite <i>but</i> for a moment?
c73147	Though his excellency mount up to the heavens,
c73148	and his head reach unto the clouds;
c73149	<i>Yet</i> he shall perish for ever like his own dung:
c73150	they which have seen him shall say,
c73151	Where <i>is</i> he?
c73152	He shall fly away as a dream,
c73153	and shall not be found:
c73154	yea, he shall be chased away as a vision of the night.
c73155	The eye also <i>which</i> saw
c73156	him shall <i>see him</i> no more;
c73157	neither shall his place any more behold him.
c73158	His children shall seek to please the poor,
c73159	and his hands shall restore their goods.
c73160	His bones are full <i>of the sin</i> of his youth,
c73161	which shall lie down with him in the dust.
c73162	Though wickedness be sweet in his mouth,
c73163	<i>though</i> he hide it under his tongue;
c73164	<i>Though</i> he spare
c73165	it, and forsake it not;
c73166	but keep it still within his mouth:
c73167	<i>Yet</i> his meat in his bowels is turned,
c73168	<i>it is</i> the gall of asps within him.
c73169	He hath swallowed down riches,
c73170	and he shall vomit them up again:
c73171	God shall cast them out of his belly.
c73172	He shall suck the poison of asps:
c73173	the viper's tongue shall slay him.
c73174	He shall not see the rivers, the floods, the brooks of honey and butter.
c73175	That which he laboured for shall he restore,
c73176	and shall not swallow <i>it</i> down:
c73177	according to <i>his</i> substance <i>shall</i> the restitution
c73178	<i>be,</i> and he shall not rejoice <i>therein.</i>
c73179	Because he hath oppressed
c73180	<i>and</i> hath forsaken the poor;
c73181	<i>because</i> he hath violently taken away an house
c73182	which he builded not;
c73183	Surely he shall not feel quietness in his belly,
c73184	he shall not save of that which he desired.
c73185	There shall none of his meat be left;
c73187	therefore shall no man look for his goods.
c73188	In the fulness of his sufficiency
c73189	he shall be in straits:
c73190	every hand of the wicked shall come upon him.
c73191	<i>When</i> he
c73192	is about to fill his belly,
c73193	<i>God</i> shall cast the fury of his wrath
c73194	upon him, and shall rain <i>it</i> upon him while he is eating.
c73195	He shall flee from the iron weapon,
c73196	<i>and</i> the bow of steel shall strike him through.
c73197	It is drawn,
c73198	and cometh out of the body;
c73199	yea, the glittering sword cometh out of his gall:
c73200	terrors <i>are</i> upon him.
c73201	All darkness <i>shall be</i> hid in his secret places:
c73202	a fire not blown shall consume
c73204	him; it shall go ill with him that is left in his tabernacle.
c73205	The heaven shall reveal his iniquity;
c73206	and the earth shall rise up against him.
c73207	The increase of his house shall depart,
c73208	<i>and his goods</i> shall flow away in the day of his wrath.
c73209	This <i>is</i> the portion of a wicked man from God,
c73210	and the heritage appointed unto him by God.
c73211	But Job answered
c73212	and said,
c73213	Hear diligently my speech,
c73214	and let this be your consolations.
c73215	Suffer
c73216	me that I may speak;
c73217	and after that I have spoken, mock on.
c73218	As for me,
c73219	<i>is</i> my complaint to man?
c73220	and if
c73221	<i>it were so,</i> why should not my spirit be troubled?
c73222	Mark
c73223	me, and be astonished,
c73224	and lay <i>your</i> hand upon <i>your</i> mouth.
c73225	Even when I remember
c73226	I am afraid,
c73227	and trembling taketh hold on my flesh.
c73228	Wherefore do the wicked live,
c73229	become old,
c73230	yea, are mighty in power?
c73231	Their seed
c73232	is established in their sight
c73233	with
c73234	them, and their offspring before their eyes.
c73235	Their houses <i>are</i> safe
c73236	from fear,
c73237	neither <i>is</i> the rod of God upon them.
c73238	Their bull gendereth,
c73239	and faileth not;
c73240	their cow calveth,
c73241	and casteth not her calf.
c73242	They send forth their little ones like a flock,
c73243	and their children dance.
c73244	They take the timbrel and harp,
c73245	and rejoice at the sound of the organ.
c73246	They spend their days in wealth,
c73247	and in a moment go down to the grave.
c73248	Therefore they say unto God,
c73249	Depart from
c73250	us; for we desire not the knowledge of thy ways.
c73251	What <i>is</i> the Almighty,
c73252	that we should serve
c73253	him? and what profit
c73254	should we have, if we pray unto him?
c73255	Lo,
c73256	their good <i>is</i> not in their hand:
c73257	the counsel of the wicked is far from me.
c73258	How oft is the candle of the wicked put out!
c73259	and <i>how oft</i> cometh their destruction upon
c73260	them! <i>God</i> distributeth sorrows in his anger.
c73261	They are as stubble before the wind,
c73262	and as chaff
c73263	that the storm carrieth away.
c73264	God layeth up his iniquity for his children:
c73265	he rewardeth
c73266	him, and he shall know <i>it.</i>
c73267	His eyes shall see his destruction,
c73268	and he shall drink of the wrath of the Almighty.
c73269	For what pleasure <i>hath</i> he in his house after
c73270	him, when the number of his months is cut off in the midst?
c73271	Shall <i>any</i> teach God knowledge?
c73272	seeing he judgeth those that are high.
c73273	One dieth in his full strength,
c73274	being wholly at ease and quiet.
c73275	His breasts are full of milk,
c73276	and his bones are moistened with marrow.
c73277	And another dieth in the bitterness of his soul,
c73278	and never eateth with pleasure.
c73279	They shall lie down alike in the dust,
c73280	and the worms shall cover them.
c73281	Behold,
c73282	I know your thoughts,
c73283	and the devices
c73284	<i>which</i> ye wrongfully imagine against me.
c73285	For ye say,
c73286	Where <i>is</i> the house of the prince?
c73287	and where <i>are</i> the dwelling places of the wicked?
c73288	Have ye not asked them that go by the way?
c73289	and do ye not know their tokens,
c73290	That the wicked is reserved to the day of destruction?
c73291	they shall be brought forth to the day of wrath.
c73292	Who shall declare his way to his face?
c73293	him <i>what</i> he hath done?
c73294	and who shall repay
c73295	Yet shall he be brought to the grave,
c73296	and shall remain in the tomb.
c73297	The clods of the valley shall be sweet
c73298	unto him, and every man shall draw after
c73299	before him.
c73300	him, as <i>there are</i> innumerable
c73301	How then comfort ye me in vain,
c73302	seeing in your answers
c73303	there remaineth falsehood?
c73304	Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered
c73305	and said,
c73306	Can a man be profitable unto God,
c73307	as he that is wise may be profitable unto himself?
c73308	<i>Is it</i> any pleasure to the Almighty,
c73309	that thou art righteous?
c73310	or <i>is it</i> gain
c73311	<i>to him,</i> that thou makest thy ways perfect?
c73312	Will he reprove thee for fear
c73313	of thee? will he enter with thee into judgment?
c73314	<i>Is</i> not thy wickedness great?
c73315	and thine iniquities infinite?
c73316	For thou hast taken a pledge from thy brother for nought,
c73317	and stripped the naked of their clothing.
c73318	Thou hast not given water to the weary to drink,
c73319	and thou hast withholden bread from the hungry.
c73320	But <i>as for</i> the mighty man,
c73321	he had the earth;
c73322	and the honourable man dwelt in it.
c73323	Thou hast sent widows away empty,
c73324	and the arms of the fatherless have been broken.
c73325	Therefore snares <i>are</i> round about
c73326	thee, and sudden fear troubleth thee;
c73327	Or darkness, <i>that</i> thou canst not see;
c73328	and abundance of waters cover thee.
c73329	<i>Is</i> not God in the height of heaven?
c73330	and behold the height of the stars,
c73331	how high they are!
c73332	And thou sayest,
c73333	How doth God know?
c73334	can he judge through the dark cloud?
c73335	Thick clouds <i>are</i> a covering
c73336	to him, that he seeth not;
c73337	and he walketh in the circuit of heaven.
c73338	Hast thou marked the old way
c73339	which wicked men have trodden?
c73340	Which were cut down
c73341	out of time,
c73342	whose foundation was overflown with a flood:
c73343	Which said unto God,
c73344	Depart from
c73345	us: and what can the Almighty do for them?
c73346	Yet he filled their houses with good
c73347	<i>things:</i> but the counsel of the wicked is far from me.
c73348	The righteous see
c73349	<i>it,</i> and are glad:
c73350	and the innocent laugh them to scorn.
c73351	Whereas our substance is not cut down,
c73352	but the remnant of them the fire consumeth.
c73353	Acquaint now thyself with
c73354	him, and be at peace:
c73355	thereby good shall come unto thee.
c73356	Receive, I pray thee, the law from his mouth,
c73357	and lay up his words in thine heart.
c73358	If thou return to the Almighty,
c73359	thou shalt be built up,
c73360	thou shalt put away iniquity far from thy tabernacles.
c73361	Then shalt thou lay up gold as dust,
c73362	and the <i>gold</i> of Ophir as the stones of the brooks.
c73363	Yea, the Almighty shall be thy defence,
c73364	and thou shalt have plenty of silver.
c73365	For then shalt thou have thy delight in the Almighty,
c73366	and shalt lift up thy face unto God.
c73367	Thou shalt make thy prayer unto
c73368	him, and he shall hear
c73369	thee, and thou shalt pay thy vows.
c73370	Thou shalt also decree a thing,
c73371	and it shall be established
c73372	unto thee: and the light shall shine upon thy ways.
c73373	When <i>men</i> are cast down,
c73374	then thou shalt say,
c73375	<i>There is</i> lifting up;
c73376	and he shall save the humble person.
c73377	He shall deliver the island of the innocent:
c73378	and it is delivered by the pureness of thine hands.
c73379	Then Job answered
c73380	and said,
c73381	Even to day <i>is</i> my complaint bitter:
c73382	my stroke is heavier than my groaning.
c73383	Oh that
c73384	I knew
c73385	where I might find
c73386	him! <i>that</i> I might come <i>even</i> to his seat!
c73387	I would order <i>my</i> cause before
c73388	him, and fill my mouth with arguments.
c73389	I would know the words
c73390	<i>which</i> he would answer
c73391	me, and understand
c73392	what he would say unto me.
c73393	Will he plead against me with <i>his</i> great power?
c73394	No;
c73395	but he would put <i>strength</i> in me.
c73396	There the righteous might dispute with
c73397	him; so should I be delivered for ever from my judge.
c73398	Behold, I go forward,
c73399	but he <i>is</i> not
c73400	<i>there;</i> and backward,
c73401	but I cannot perceive him:
c73402	On the left hand,
c73403	where he doth work,
c73404	but I cannot behold
c73405	<i>him:</i> he hideth himself on the right hand,
c73406	that I cannot see <i>him:</i>
c73407	But he knoweth the way that I take:
c73408	<i>when</i> he hath tried
c73409	me, I shall come forth as gold.
c73410	My foot hath held his steps,
c73411	his way have I kept,
c73412	and not declined.
c73413	from the commandment of his lips;
c73414	Neither have I gone back
c73415	I have esteemed the words of his mouth more than my necessary <i>food.</i>
c73416	But he <i>is</i> in one
c73417	<i>mind,</i> and who can turn
c73418	him? and <i>what</i> his soul desireth,
c73419	even <i>that</i> he doeth.
c73420	For he performeth <i>the thing that is</i> appointed
c73421	for me: and many such <i>things are</i> with him.
c73422	Therefore am I troubled at his presence:
c73423	when I consider,
c73424	I am afraid of him.
c73425	For God maketh my heart soft,
c73426	and the Almighty troubleth me:
c73427	Because I was not cut off before the darkness,
c73428	<i>neither</i> hath he covered the darkness from my face.
c73429	Why, seeing times are not hidden from the Almighty,
c73430	do they that know him not see his days?
c73431	<i>Some</i> remove the landmarks;
c73432	they violently take away flocks,
c73433	and feed <i>thereof.</i>
c73434	They drive away the ass of the fatherless,
c73435	they take the widow's ox for a pledge.
c73436	They turn the needy out of the way:
c73437	the poor of the earth hide themselves together.
c73438	Behold, <i>as</i> wild asses in the desert,
c73439	go they forth to their work;
c73440	rising betimes for a prey:
c73441	the wilderness <i>yieldeth</i> food for them <i>and</i> for <i>their</i> children.
c73442	They reap <i>every one</i> his corn in the field:
c73443	and they gather the vintage of the wicked.
c73444	They cause the naked to lodge without clothing,
c73445	that <i>they have</i> no covering in the cold.
c73446	They are wet with the showers of the mountains,
c73447	and embrace the rock for want of a shelter.
c73448	They pluck the fatherless from the breast,
c73449	and take a pledge of the poor.
c73450	They cause <i>him</i> to go naked without clothing,
c73451	and they take away the sheaf <i>from</i> the hungry;
c73452	<i>Which</i> make oil within their walls,
c73453	<i>and</i> tread <i>their</i> winepresses,
c73454	and suffer thirst.
c73455	Men groan from out of the city,
c73456	and the soul of the wounded crieth out:
c73457	yet God layeth not folly <i>to them.</i>
c73458	They are of those that rebel against the light;
c73459	they know not the ways
c73460	thereof, nor abide in the paths thereof.
c73461	The murderer rising with the light
c73462	killeth the poor and needy,
c73463	and in the night is as a thief.
c73464	The eye also of the adulterer waiteth for the twilight,
c73465	saying,
c73466	No eye shall see
c73467	me: and disguiseth <i>his</i> face.
c73468	In the dark they dig through houses,
c73469	<i>which</i> they had marked for themselves in the daytime:
c73470	they know not the light.
c73471	For the morning <i>is</i> to them even as the shadow of death:
c73472	if <i>one</i> know <i>them, they are in</i> the terrors of the shadow of death.
c73473	He <i>is</i> swift as the waters;
c73474	their portion is cursed in the earth:
c73475	he beholdeth not the way of the vineyards.
c73476	Drought and heat consume the snow waters:
c73477	<i>so doth</i> the grave
c73478	<i>those which</i> have sinned.
c73479	The womb shall forget
c73480	him; the worm shall feed sweetly
c73481	on him; he shall be no more remembered;
c73482	and wickedness shall be broken as a tree.
c73483	He evil entreateth the barren
c73484	<i>that</i> beareth not:
c73485	and doeth not good to the widow.
c73486	He draweth also the mighty with his power:
c73487	he riseth up,
c73488	and no <i>man</i> is sure of life.
c73489	<i>Though</i> it be given him <i>to be</i> in safety,
c73490	whereon he resteth;
c73491	yet his eyes <i>are</i> upon their ways.
c73492	They are exalted for a little while,
c73493	but are gone
c73494	and brought low;
c73495	they are taken out of the way as all
c73496	<i>other,</i> and cut off as the tops of the ears of corn.
c73497	And if <i>it be</i> not <i>so</i> now,
c73498	who will make me a liar,
c73499	and make my speech nothing worth?
c73500	Then answered Bildad the Shuhite,
c73501	and said,
c73502	Dominion and fear <i>are</i> with
c73503	him, he maketh peace in his high places.
c73504	Is there any number of his armies?
c73505	and upon whom doth not his light arise?
c73506	How then can man be justified with God?
c73507	or how can he be clean <i>that is</i> born of a woman?
c73508	Behold even to the moon,
c73509	and it shineth not;
c73510	yea, the stars
c73511	are not pure in his sight.
c73512	How much less man,
c73513	<i>that is</i> a worm?
c73514	and the son of man,
c73515	<i>which is</i> a worm?
c73516	But Job answered
c73517	and said,
c73518	How hast thou helped <i>him that is</i> without power?
c73519	<i>how</i> savest thou the arm <i>that hath</i> no strength?
c73520	How hast thou counselled <i>him that hath</i> no wisdom?
c73521	and <i>how</i> hast thou plentifully declared the thing as it is?
c73522	To whom hast thou uttered words?
c73523	and whose spirit came from thee?
c73524	Dead <i>things</i> are formed from under the waters, and the inhabitants thereof.
c73525	Hell <i>is</i> naked before
c73526	him, and destruction hath no covering.
c73527	He stretcheth out the north over the empty place,
c73528	<i>and</i> hangeth the earth upon nothing.
c73529	He bindeth up the waters in his thick clouds;
c73530	and the cloud is not rent under them.
c73531	He holdeth back the face of his throne,
c73532	<i>and</i> spreadeth his cloud upon it.
c73533	He hath compassed the waters with bounds, until the day and night come to an end.
c73534	The pillars of heaven tremble
c73535	and are astonished at his reproof.
c73536	He divideth the sea with his power,
c73537	and by his understanding he smiteth through the proud.
c73538	By his spirit he hath garnished the heavens;
c73539	his hand hath formed the crooked serpent.
c73540	Lo, these <i>are</i> parts of his ways:
c73541	but how little a portion is heard
c73542	of him? but the thunder of his power who can understand?
c73543	Moreover Job
c73544	continued his parable,
c73545	and said,
c73546	<i>As</i> God liveth,
c73547	<i>who</i> hath taken away my judgment;
c73548	and the Almighty,
c73549	<i>who</i> hath vexed my soul;
c73550	All the while my breath
c73551	<i>is</i> in me, and the spirit of God <i>is</i> in my nostrils;
c73552	My lips shall not speak wickedness,
c73554	nor my tongue utter deceit.
c73555	God forbid
c73556	that I should justify
c73557	you: till I die
c73558	I will not remove mine integrity from me.
c73559	My righteousness I hold fast,
c73560	and will not let it go:
c73561	my heart shall not reproach <i>me</i> so long as I live.
c73562	Let mine enemy be as the wicked,
c73563	and he that riseth up against me as the unrighteous.
c73564	For what <i>is</i> the hope of the hypocrite,
c73565	though he hath gained,
c73566	when God taketh away his soul?
c73567	Will God hear his cry
c73568	when trouble cometh upon him?
c73569	Will he delight himself in the Almighty?
c73570	will he always call upon God?
c73571	I will teach you by the hand of God:
c73572	<i>that</i> which <i>is</i> with the Almighty
c73573	will I not conceal.
c73574	Behold, all ye yourselves
c73575	have seen
c73576	<i>it;</i> why then are ye thus altogether vain?
c73577	This <i>is</i> the portion of a wicked man with God,
c73578	and the heritage of oppressors,
c73579	<i>which</i> they shall receive of the Almighty.
c73580	If his children be multiplied,
c73581	<i>it is</i> for the sword:
c73582	and his offspring shall not be satisfied with bread.
c73583	Those that remain of him shall be buried in death:
c73584	and his widows shall not weep.
c73585	Though he heap up silver as the dust,
c73586	and prepare raiment as the clay;
c73587	He may prepare
c73588	<i>it,</i> but the just shall put <i>it</i> on,
c73589	and the innocent shall divide the silver.
c73590	He buildeth his house as a moth,
c73591	and as a booth <i>that</i> the keeper maketh.
c73592	The rich man shall lie down,
c73593	but he shall not be gathered:
c73594	he openeth his eyes,
c73595	and he <i>is</i> not.
c73596	Terrors take hold on him as waters,
c73597	a tempest stealeth him away in the night.
c73598	The east wind carrieth him away,
c73599	and he departeth:
c73600	and as a storm hurleth him out of his place.
c73601	For <i>God</i> shall cast upon
c73602	him, and not spare:
c73603	he would fain flee out of his hand.
c73604	<i>Men</i> shall clap their hands at
c73605	him, and shall hiss him out of his place.
c73606	Surely there is a vein for the silver,
c73607	and a place for gold
c73608	<i>where</i> they fine <i>it.</i>
c73609	Iron is taken out of the earth,
c73610	and brass <i>is</i> molten <i>out of</i> the stone.
c73611	He setteth an end to darkness,
c73612	and searcheth out all perfection: the stones of darkness, and the shadow of death.
c73613	The flood breaketh out
c73614	from the inhabitant;
c73615	<i>even the waters</i> forgotten of the foot:
c73616	they are dried up,
c73617	they are gone away from men.
c73618	<i>As for</i> the earth,
c73619	out of it cometh bread:
c73620	and under it is turned up as it were fire.
c73621	The stones of it <i>are</i> the place of sapphires:
c73622	and it hath dust of gold.
c73623	<i>There is</i> a path
c73624	which no fowl knoweth,
c73625	and which the vulture's eye hath not seen:
c73626	The lion's whelps have not trodden
c73627	it, nor the fierce lion passed by it.
c73628	He putteth forth his hand upon the rock;
c73629	he overturneth the mountains by the roots.
c73630	He cutteth out rivers among the rocks;
c73631	and his eye seeth every precious thing.
c73632	He bindeth the floods from overflowing;
c73633	and <i>the thing that is</i> hid bringeth he forth to light.
c73634	But where shall wisdom be found?
c73635	and where <i>is</i> the place of understanding?
c73636	Man knoweth not the price
c73637	thereof; neither is it found in the land of the living.
c73638	The depth saith,
c73639	It <i>is</i> not
c73640	in me: and the sea saith,
c73641	<i>It is</i> not with me.
c73642	It cannot be gotten for gold,
c73643	neither shall silver be weighed <i>for</i> the price thereof.
c73644	It cannot be valued with the gold of Ophir,
c73645	with the precious onyx, or the sapphire.
c73646	The gold and the crystal cannot equal
c73647	it: and the exchange of it <i>shall not be for</i> jewels of fine gold.
c73648	No mention shall be made of coral, or of pearls:
c73649	for the price of wisdom <i>is</i> above rubies.
c73650	The topaz of Ethiopia shall not equal
c73651	it, neither shall it be valued with pure gold.
c73652	Whence then cometh wisdom?
c73653	and where <i>is</i> the place of understanding?
c73654	Seeing it is hid from the eyes of all living,
c73655	and kept close from the fowls of the air.
c73656	Destruction and death say,
c73657	We have heard the fame thereof with our ears.
c73658	God understandeth the way
c73659	thereof, and he knoweth the place thereof.
c73660	For he looketh to the ends of the earth,
c73661	<i>and</i> seeth under the whole heaven;
c73662	To make the weight for the winds;
c73663	and he weigheth the waters by measure.
c73664	When he made a decree for the rain,
c73665	and a way for the lightning of the thunder:
c73666	Then did he see
c73667	it, and declare
c73668	it; he prepared
c73669	it, yea, and searched it out.
c73670	And unto man he said,
c73671	Behold, the fear of the Lord,
c73672	that <i>is</i> wisdom;
c73674	and to depart from evil
c73675	<i>is</i> understanding.
c73676	Moreover Job
c73677	continued his parable,
c73678	and said,
c73679	Oh that I were as <i>in</i> months past, as <i>in</i> the days
c73680	<i>when</i> God preserved me;
c73681	When his candle shined upon my head,
c73682	<i>and when</i> by his light I walked <i>through</i> darkness;
c73683	As I was in the days of my youth,
c73684	when the secret of God <i>was</i> upon my tabernacle;
c73685	When the Almighty <i>was</i> yet with
c73686	me, <i>when</i> my children <i>were</i> about me;
c73687	When I washed my steps with butter,
c73688	and the rock poured me out rivers of oil;
c73689	When I went out to the gate through the city,
c73690	<i>when</i> I prepared my seat in the street!
c73691	The young men saw
c73692	me, and hid themselves:
c73693	and the aged arose,
c73694	<i>and</i> stood up.
c73695	The princes refrained talking,
c73696	and laid <i>their</i> hand on their mouth.
c73697	The nobles held their peace,
c73698	and their tongue cleaved to the roof of their mouth.
c73699	When the ear heard
c73700	<i>me,</i> then it blessed
c73701	me; and when the eye saw
c73702	<i>me,</i> it gave witness to me:
c73703	Because I delivered the poor
c73704	that cried,
c73705	and the fatherless,
c73706	and <i>him that had</i> none to help him.
c73707	The blessing of him that was ready to perish came upon
c73708	me: and I caused the widow's heart to sing for joy.
c73709	I put on righteousness,
c73710	and it clothed
c73711	me: my judgment <i>was</i> as a robe and a diadem.
c73712	I was eyes to the blind,
c73713	and feet <i>was</i> I to the lame.
c73714	I <i>was</i> a father to the poor:
c73715	and the cause
c73716	<i>which</i> I knew not
c73717	I searched out.
c73718	And I brake the jaws of the wicked,
c73719	and plucked the spoil out of his teeth.
c73720	Then I said,
c73721	I shall die in my nest,
c73722	and I shall multiply <i>my</i> days as the sand.
c73723	My root <i>was</i> spread out by the waters,
c73724	and the dew lay all night upon my branch.
c73725	My glory <i>was</i> fresh in
c73726	me, and my bow was renewed in my hand.
c73727	Unto me <i>men</i> gave ear,
c73728	and waited,
c73729	and kept silence at my counsel.
c73730	After my words they spake not again;
c73731	and my speech dropped upon them.
c73732	And they waited for me as for the rain;
c73733	and they opened their mouth wide <i>as</i> for the latter rain.
c73734	<i>If</i> I laughed on
c73735	them, they believed <i>it</i> not;
c73736	and the light of my countenance they cast not down.
c73737	I chose out their way,
c73738	and sat chief,
c73739	and dwelt as a king in the army,
c73740	as one <i>that</i> comforteth the mourners.
c73741	But now <i>they that are</i> younger than I have me in derision,
c73743	whose fathers I would have disdained
c73744	to have set with the dogs of my flock.
c73745	Yea, whereto <i>might</i> the strength of their hands
c73747	<i>profit</i> me, in whom old age was perished?
c73748	For want and famine <i>they were</i> solitary;
c73749	fleeing into the wilderness
c73750	in former time desolate and waste.
c73751	Who cut up mallows by the bushes,
c73752	and juniper roots <i>for</i> their meat.
c73753	They were driven forth from among
c73754	<i>men,</i> (they cried after them as <i>after</i> a thief;)
c73755	in the clifts of the valleys,
c73756	To dwell
c73757	<i>in</i> caves of the earth, and <i>in</i> the rocks.
c73758	Among the bushes they brayed;
c73759	under the nettles they were gathered together.
c73760	<i>They were</i> children of fools,
c73761	yea, children of base men:
c73762	they were viler than the earth.
c73763	And now am I their song,
c73764	yea, I am their byword.
c73765	They abhor
c73766	me, they flee far from
c73767	me, and spare not to spit in my face.
c73768	Because he hath loosed my cord,
c73769	and afflicted
c73770	me, they have also let loose the bridle before me.
c73771	Upon <i>my</i> right <i>hand</i> rise the youth;
c73772	they push away my feet,
c73773	and they raise up against me the ways of their destruction.
c73774	They mar my path,
c73775	they set forward my calamity,
c73776	they have no helper.
c73777	They came <i>upon me</i> as a wide breaking in
c73778	<i>of waters:</i> in the desolation they rolled themselves <i>upon me.</i>
c73779	Terrors are turned upon
c73780	me: they pursue my soul as the wind:
c73781	and my welfare passeth away as a cloud.
c73782	And now my soul is poured out upon
c73783	me; the days of affliction have taken hold upon me.
c73784	My bones are pierced in me in the night season:
c73785	and my sinews take no rest.
c73786	By the great force <i>of my disease</i> is my garment changed:
c73787	it bindeth me about as the collar of my coat.
c73788	He hath cast me into the mire,
c73789	and I am become like dust and ashes.
c73790	I cry unto
c73791	thee, and thou dost not hear
c73792	me: I stand up,
c73793	and thou regardest me <i>not.</i>
c73794	Thou art become cruel
c73795	to me: with thy strong hand thou opposest thyself against me.
c73796	Thou liftest me up to the wind;
c73797	thou causest me to ride
c73798	<i>upon it,</i> and dissolvest my substance.
c73799	For I know
c73800	<i>that</i> thou wilt bring me <i>to</i> death,
c73801	and <i>to</i> the house appointed for all living.
c73802	Howbeit he will not stretch out <i>his</i> hand to the grave,
c73803	though they cry in his destruction.
c73804	Did not I weep for him that was in trouble?
c73805	was <i>not</i> my soul grieved for the poor?
c73806	When I looked for good,
c73807	then evil came
c73808	<i>unto me:</i> and when I waited for light,
c73809	there came darkness.
c73810	My bowels boiled,
c73811	and rested not:
c73812	the days of affliction prevented me.
c73813	I went mourning without the sun:
c73814	I stood up,
c73815	<i>and</i> I cried in the congregation.
c73816	I am a brother to dragons,
c73817	and a companion to owls.
c73818	My skin is black upon
c73819	me, and my bones are burned with heat.
c73820	My harp also is <i>turned</i> to mourning,
c73821	and my organ into the voice of them that weep.
c73822	I made a covenant with mine eyes;
c73823	why then should I think upon a maid?
c73824	For what portion of God <i>is there</i> from above?
c73825	and <i>what</i> inheritance of the Almighty from on high?
c73826	<i>Is</i> not destruction to the wicked?
c73827	and a strange <i>punishment</i> to the workers of iniquity?
c73828	Doth not he see my ways,
c73829	and count all my steps?
c73830	If I have walked with vanity,
c73831	or if my foot hath hasted to deceit;
c73832	Let me be weighed in an even balance,
c73833	that God may know mine integrity.
c73834	If my step hath turned out of the way,
c73835	and mine heart walked after mine eyes,
c73836	and if any blot hath cleaved to mine hands;
c73837	<i>Then</i> let me sow,
c73838	and let another eat;
c73839	yea, let my offspring be rooted out.
c73840	If mine heart have been deceived by a woman,
c73841	or <i>if</i> I have laid wait at my neighbour's door;
c73842	<i>Then</i> let my wife grind unto another,
c73843	and let others bow down upon her.
c73844	For this <i>is</i> an heinous crime;
c73845	yea, it <i>is</i> an iniquity
c73846	<i>to be punished by</i> the judges.
c73847	For it <i>is</i> a fire
c73848	<i>that</i> consumeth to destruction,
c73849	and would root out all mine increase.
c73850	If I did despise the cause of my manservant or of my maidservant, when they contended with me;
c73851	What then shall I do
c73852	when God riseth up?
c73853	and when he visiteth,
c73854	what shall I answer him?
c73855	Did not he that made me in the womb make
c73856	him? and did not one fashion us in the womb?
c73857	If I have withheld the poor from <i>their</i> desire,
c73858	or have caused the eyes of the widow to fail;
c73859	Or have eaten my morsel myself alone,
c73860	and the fatherless hath not eaten thereof;
c73861	(For from my youth he was brought up with me, as <i>with</i> a father,
c73862	and I have guided her from my mother's womb;)
c73863	If I have seen any perish for want of clothing,
c73864	or any poor without covering;
c73865	If his loins have not blessed
c73866	me, and <i>if</i> he were <i>not</i> warmed with the fleece of my sheep;
c73867	If I have lifted up my hand against the fatherless,
c73868	when I saw my help in the gate:
c73869	<i>Then</i> let mine arm fall from my shoulder blade,
c73870	and mine arm be broken from the bone.
c73871	For destruction <i>from</i> God <i>was</i> a terror to
c73872	me, and by reason of his highness I could not endure.
c73873	If I have made gold my hope,
c73874	or have said to the fine gold,
c73875	<i>Thou art</i> my confidence;
c73876	If I rejoiced
c73877	because my wealth <i>was</i> great,
c73878	and because mine hand had gotten much;
c73879	If I beheld the sun
c73880	when it shined,
c73881	or the moon walking <i>in</i> brightness;
c73882	And my heart hath been secretly enticed,
c73883	or my mouth hath kissed my hand:
c73884	This also <i>were</i> an iniquity
c73885	<i>to be punished by</i> the judge:
c73886	for I should have denied the God <i>that is</i> above.
c73887	If I rejoiced at the destruction of him that hated
c73888	me, or lifted up myself
c73889	when evil found him:
c73890	Neither have I suffered
c73891	to sin
c73892	my mouth
c73893	by wishing a curse to his soul.
c73894	If the men of my tabernacle said not,
c73895	Oh that we had
c73896	of his flesh! we cannot be satisfied.
c73897	The stranger did not lodge in the street:
c73898	<i>but</i> I opened my doors to the traveller.
c73899	If I covered my transgressions as Adam,
c73900	by hiding mine iniquity in my bosom:
c73901	Did I fear a great multitude,
c73902	or did the contempt of families terrify
c73903	me, that I kept silence,
c73904	<i>and</i> went not out of the door?
c73905	Oh that one would hear
c73906	me! behold, my desire
c73907	<i>is, that</i> the Almighty would answer
c73908	me, and <i>that</i> mine adversary had written a book.
c73909	Surely I would take it upon my shoulder,
c73910	<i>and</i> bind it <i>as</i> a crown to me.
c73911	I would declare unto him the number of my steps;
c73912	as a prince would I go near unto him.
c73913	If my land cry against
c73914	me, or that the furrows likewise thereof complain;
c73915	If I have eaten the fruits thereof without money,
c73916	or have caused the owners thereof to lose their life:
c73917	Let thistles grow instead of wheat,
c73918	and cockle instead of barley.
c73919	The words of Job are ended.
c73920	So these three men ceased
c73921	to answer Job,
c73922	because he <i>was</i> righteous in his own eyes.
c73923	Then was kindled the wrath of Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite, of the kindred of Ram:
c73924	against Job was his wrath kindled,
c73925	because he justified himself rather than God.
c73926	Also against his three friends was his wrath kindled,
c73927	because they had found no answer,
c73928	and <i>yet</i> had condemned Job.
c73929	Now Elihu had waited till Job had spoken,
c73930	because they <i>were</i> elder than he.
c73931	When Elihu saw
c73932	that <i>there was</i> no answer in the mouth of <i>these</i> three men,
c73933	then his wrath was kindled.
c73934	And Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite answered
c73935	and said,
c73936	I <i>am</i> young,
c73937	and ye <i>are</i> very old;
c73938	wherefore I was afraid,
c73939	and durst
c73940	not shew you mine opinion.
c73941	I said,
c73942	Days should speak,
c73943	and multitude of years should teach wisdom.
c73944	But
c73945	<i>there is</i> a spirit in man:
c73946	and the inspiration of the Almighty giveth them understanding.
c73947	Great men are not <i>always</i> wise:
c73948	neither do the aged understand judgment.
c73949	Therefore I said,
c73950	Hearken
c73951	to me; I also will shew mine opinion.
c73952	Behold, I waited for your words;
c73953	I gave ear to your reasons,
c73954	whilst ye searched out what to say.
c73955	Yea, I attended unto
c73956	you, and, behold,
c73957	<i>there was</i> none
c73958	you that convinced Job,
c73959	<i>or</i> that answered his words:
c73960	of
c73961	Lest ye should say,
c73962	We have found out wisdom:
c73963	God thrusteth him down,
c73964	not man.
c73965	Now he hath not directed <i>his</i> words against
c73966	me: neither will I answer him with your speeches.
c73967	They were amazed,
c73968	they answered no more:
c73969	they left off speaking.
c73970	When I had waited,
c73971	(for they spake not,
c73972	but stood still,
c73973	<i>and</i> answered no more;)
c73974	<i>I said,</i> I will answer also my part,
c73975	I also will shew mine opinion.
c73976	For I am full of matter,
c73977	the spirit within me constraineth me.
c73978	Behold, my belly <i>is</i> as wine
c73979	<i>which</i> hath no vent;
c73980	it is ready to burst like new bottles.
c73981	I will speak,
c73982	that I may be refreshed:
c73983	I will open my lips
c73984	and answer.
c73985	Let me not, I pray you, accept any man's person,
c73986	neither let me give flattering titles unto man.
c73987	For I know not
c73988	to give flattering titles;
c73989	<i>in so doing</i> my maker would soon take me away.
c73990	Wherefore,
c73991	I pray thee, hear
c73992	Job,
c73993	my speeches,
c73994	and hearken to all my words.
c73995	Behold, now I have opened my mouth,
c73996	my tongue hath spoken in my mouth.
c73997	My words <i>shall be of</i> the uprightness of my heart:
c73998	and my lips shall utter knowledge clearly.
c73999	The Spirit of God hath made
c74000	me, and the breath of the Almighty hath given me life.
c74001	If thou canst
c74002	answer
c74003	me, set <i>thy words</i> in order before
c74004	me, stand up.
c74005	Behold, I <i>am</i> according to thy wish in God's
c74006	stead: I also am formed out of the clay.
c74007	Behold, my terror shall not make thee afraid,
c74008	neither shall my hand be heavy upon thee.
c74009	Surely thou hast spoken in mine hearing,
c74010	and I have heard the voice of <i>thy</i> words, <i>saying,</i>
c74011	I am clean
c74012	without transgression,
c74013	I <i>am</i> innocent;
c74014	neither <i>is there</i> iniquity in me.
c74015	Behold, he findeth occasions against
c74016	me, he counteth me for his enemy,
c74017	He putteth my feet in the stocks,
c74018	he marketh all my paths.
c74019	Behold, <i>in</i> this thou art not just:
c74020	I will answer
c74021	thee, that God is greater than man.
c74022	Why dost thou strive against
c74023	him? for he giveth not account of any of his matters.
c74024	For God speaketh once,
c74025	yea twice,
c74026	<i>yet man</i> perceiveth it not.
c74027	In a dream, in a vision of the night,
c74028	when deep sleep falleth upon men,
c74029	in slumberings upon the bed;
c74030	Then he openeth the ears of men,
c74031	and sealeth their instruction,
c74032	That he may withdraw man <i>from his</i> purpose,
c74033	and hide pride from man.
c74034	He keepeth back his soul from the pit,
c74035	and his life
c74036	from perishing by the sword.
c74037	He is chastened also with pain upon his bed,
c74038	and the multitude of his bones with strong <i>pain:</i>
c74039	So that his life abhorreth bread,
c74040	and his soul dainty meat.
c74041	His flesh is consumed away, that it cannot be seen;
c74042	and his bones <i>that</i> were not seen stick out.
c74044	Yea, his soul draweth near unto the grave,
c74045	and his life to the destroyers.
c74046	If there be a messenger with him, an interpreter, one among a thousand,
c74047	to shew unto man his uprightness:
c74048	Then he is gracious
c74049	unto him, and saith,
c74050	Deliver
c74051	him from going down to the pit:
c74052	I have found a ransom.
c74053	His flesh shall be fresher than a child's:
c74054	he shall return to the days of his youth:
c74055	He shall pray unto God,
c74056	and he will be favourable
c74057	unto him: and he shall see his face with joy:
c74058	for he will render unto man his righteousness.
c74059	He looketh upon men,
c74060	and <i>if any</i> say,
c74061	I have sinned,
c74062	and perverted <i>that which was</i> right,
c74063	and it profited me not;
c74064	He will deliver his soul
c74065	from going into the pit,
c74066	and his life shall see the light.
c74067	Lo, all these <i>things</i> worketh God oftentimes with man,
c74068	To bring back his soul from the pit,
c74069	to be enlightened with the light of the living.
c74070	Mark well,
c74071	O Job,
c74072	hearken
c74073	unto me: hold thy peace,
c74074	and I will speak.
c74075	If thou hast any thing to say,
c74076	answer
c74077	me: speak,
c74078	for I desire
c74079	to justify thee.
c74080	If not,
c74081	hearken
c74082	unto me: hold thy peace,
c74083	and I shall teach thee wisdom.
c74084	Furthermore Elihu answered
c74085	and said,
c74086	Hear
c74087	O ye wise
c74088	my words,
c74089	unto me, ye that have knowledge.
c74090	<i>men;</i> and give ear
c74091	For the ear trieth words,
c74092	as the mouth tasteth
c74093	meat.
c74094	Let us choose to us judgment:
c74095	let us know among
c74096	ourselves what <i>is</i> good.
c74097	For Job hath said,
c74098	I am righteous:
c74099	and God hath taken away my judgment.
c74100	Should I lie against my right?
c74101	my wound <i>is</i> incurable without transgression.
c74102	What man <i>is</i> like Job,
c74103	<i>who</i> drinketh up scorning like water?
c74104	Which goeth in company with the workers of iniquity,
c74105	and walketh with wicked men.
c74106	For he hath said,
c74107	It profiteth a man nothing
c74108	that he should delight himself with God.
c74109	Therefore
c74110	unto me, ye men of understanding:
c74111	hearken
c74112	far be it from God, <i>that he should do</i> wickedness;
c74113	and <i>from</i> the Almighty, <i>that he should commit</i> iniquity.
c74114	For the work of a man shall he render
c74115	unto him, and cause every man to find according to <i>his</i> ways.
c74116	Yea, surely God will not do wickedly,
c74117	neither will the Almighty pervert judgment.
c74118	Who hath given him a charge over the earth?
c74119	or who hath disposed the whole world?
c74120	If he set his heart upon
c74121	man, <i>if</i> he gather unto himself his spirit and his breath;
c74122	All flesh shall perish together,
c74123	and man shall turn again unto dust.
c74124	If now <i>thou hast</i> understanding,
c74125	hear this:
c74126	hearken to the voice of my words.
c74127	Shall even he that hateth right govern?
c74128	and wilt thou condemn him that is most just?
c74129	<i>Is it fit</i> to say to a king,
c74130	<i>Thou art</i> wicked?
c74131	<i>Ye are</i> ungodly?
c74132	<i>and</i> to princes,
c74133	<i>How much less to him</i> that accepteth not the persons of princes,
c74134	nor regardeth the rich more than the poor?
c74135	for they all <i>are</i> the work of his hands.
c74136	In a moment shall they die,
c74137	and the people shall be troubled at midnight,
c74138	and pass away:
c74139	and the mighty shall be taken away
c74140	without hand.
c74141	For his eyes <i>are</i> upon the ways of man,
c74142	and he seeth all his goings.
c74143	<i>There is</i> no darkness,
c74144	nor shadow of death,
c74145	where the workers of iniquity may hide themselves.
c74146	For he will not lay upon man more
c74147	<i>than right;</i> that he should enter into judgment with God.
c74148	He shall break in pieces mighty men without number,
c74149	and set others in their stead.
c74150	Therefore he knoweth their works,
c74151	and he overturneth <i>them</i> in the night,
c74152	so that they are destroyed.
c74153	He striketh them as wicked men in the open sight of others;
c74154	Because they turned back from
c74155	him, and would not consider any of his ways:
c74156	So that they cause the cry of the poor to come unto
c74157	him, and he heareth the cry of the afflicted.
c74158	When he giveth quietness,
c74159	who then can make trouble?
c74160	and when he hideth <i>his</i> face,
c74161	who then can behold
c74162	him? whether <i>it be done</i> against a nation, or against a man only:
c74163	That the hypocrite reign not, lest the people be ensnared.
c74164	Surely it is meet
c74165	unto God,
c74166	to be said
c74167	I have borne
c74168	<i>chastisement,</i> I will not offend <i>any more:</i>
c74169	<i>That which</i> I see not
c74170	teach thou
c74171	me: if I have done iniquity,
c74172	I will do no more.
c74173	<i>Should it be</i> according to thy mind? he will recompense
c74174	it, whether thou refuse,
c74175	or whether thou choose;
c74176	and not I:
c74178	what thou knowest.
c74179	therefore speak
c74180	Let men of understanding tell
c74181	me, and let a wise man
c74182	hearken unto me.
c74183	Job hath spoken without knowledge,
c74184	and his words <i>were</i> without
c74185	wisdom.
c74186	My desire
c74187	<i>is that</i> Job may be tried unto the end because of <i>his</i> answers for wicked men.
c74188	For he addeth rebellion unto his sin,
c74189	he clappeth <i>his hands</i> among
c74190	us, and multiplieth his words against God.
c74191	Elihu spake
c74192	moreover, and said,
c74193	Thinkest thou this to be right,
c74194	<i>that</i> thou saidst,
c74195	My righteousness <i>is</i> more than God's?
c74196	For thou saidst,
c74197	What advantage
c74198	will it be unto thee? <i>and,</i> What profit shall I have, <i>if I be cleansed</i> from my sin?
c74199	I will answer
c74200	thee, and thy companions with thee.
c74201	Look unto the heavens,
c74202	and see;
c74203	and behold the clouds
c74204	<i>which</i> are higher than thou.
c74205	If thou sinnest,
c74206	what doest
c74207	thou against him? or <i>if</i> thy transgressions be multiplied,
c74208	what doest thou unto him?
c74209	If thou be righteous,
c74210	what givest
c74211	thou him? or what receiveth he of thine hand?
c74212	Thy wickedness <i>may hurt</i> a man as thou
c74213	<i>art;</i> and thy righteousness <i>may profit</i> the son of man.
c74214	By reason of the multitude of oppressions they make <i>the oppressed</i> to cry:
c74215	they cry out by reason of the arm of the mighty.
c74216	But none saith,
c74217	Where <i>is</i> God my maker,
c74218	who giveth songs in the night;
c74219	Who teacheth us more than the beasts of the earth,
c74220	and maketh us wiser than the fowls of heaven?
c74221	There they cry,
c74222	but none giveth answer, because of the pride of evil men.
c74223	Surely God will not hear vanity,
c74224	neither will the Almighty regard it.
c74225	Although thou sayest
c74226	thou shalt not see
c74227	him, <i>yet</i> judgment <i>is</i> before
c74228	him; therefore trust thou in him.
c74229	But now,
c74230	because <i>it is</i> not <i>so,</i> he hath visited in his anger;
c74231	yet he knoweth <i>it</i> not in great extremity:
c74232	Therefore doth Job open his mouth in vain;
c74233	he multiplieth words without knowledge.
c74234	Elihu also proceeded,
c74235	and said,
c74236	Suffer me a little,
c74237	and I will shew
c74238	thee that <i>I have</i> yet to speak on God's behalf.
c74239	I will fetch my knowledge from afar,
c74240	and will ascribe righteousness to my Maker.
c74241	For truly my words <i>shall</i> not <i>be</i> false:
c74242	he that is perfect in knowledge <i>is</i> with thee.
c74243	Behold, God <i>is</i> mighty,
c74244	and despiseth not
c74245	<i>any: he is</i> mighty in strength <i>and</i> wisdom.
c74246	He preserveth not the life of the wicked:
c74247	but giveth right to the poor.
c74248	He withdraweth not his eyes from the righteous:
c74249	but with kings <i>are they</i> on the throne;
c74250	yea, he doth establish them for ever,
c74251	and they are exalted.
c74252	And if <i>they be</i> bound in fetters,
c74253	<i>and</i> be holden in cords of affliction;
c74254	Then he sheweth them their work, and their transgressions
c74255	that they have exceeded.
c74256	He openeth also their ear to discipline,
c74257	and commandeth
c74258	that they return from iniquity.
c74259	If they obey
c74260	and serve
c74261	<i>him,</i> they shall spend their days in prosperity,
c74262	and their years in pleasures.
c74263	But if they obey not,
c74264	they shall perish by the sword,
c74265	and they shall die without knowledge.
c74266	But the hypocrites in heart heap up wrath:
c74267	they cry not
c74268	when he bindeth them.
c74269	They die in youth,
c74270	and their life <i>is</i> among the unclean.
c74271	He delivereth the poor in his affliction,
c74272	and openeth their ears in oppression.
c74273	Even so would he have removed thee out of the strait <i>into</i> a broad place,
c74274	where <i>there is</i> no straitness;
c74275	and that which should be set on thy table <i>should be</i> full of fatness.
c74276	But thou hast fulfilled the judgment of the wicked:
c74277	judgment and justice take hold <i>on thee.</i>
c74278	Because <i>there is</i> wrath,
c74279	<i>beware</i> lest he take thee away with <i>his</i> stroke:
c74280	then a great ransom cannot deliver thee.
c74281	Will he esteem thy riches?
c74282	<i>no,</i> not gold,
c74283	nor all the forces of strength.
c74284	Desire not the night,
c74285	when people are cut off in their place.
c74286	Take heed,
c74287	regard not iniquity:
c74288	for this hast thou chosen rather than affliction.
c74289	Behold, God exalteth by his power:
c74290	who teacheth like him?
c74291	Who hath enjoined him his way?
c74292	or who can say,
c74293	Thou hast wrought iniquity?
c74294	Remember
c74295	that thou magnify his work,
c74296	which men behold.
c74297	Every man may see
c74298	it; man may behold <i>it</i> afar off.
c74299	Behold, God <i>is</i> great,
c74300	and we know <i>him</i> not, neither can the number of his years
c74301	be searched out.
c74302	For he maketh small the drops of water:
c74303	they pour down rain according to the vapour thereof:
c74304	Which the clouds do drop
c74305	<i>and</i> distil upon man abundantly.
c74306	Also can <i>any</i> understand the spreadings of the clouds,
c74307	<i>or</i> the noise of his tabernacle?
c74308	Behold, he spreadeth his light upon
c74309	it, and covereth the bottom of the sea.
c74310	For by them judgeth he the people;
c74311	he giveth meat in abundance.
c74312	With clouds he covereth the light;
c74313	and commandeth it <i>not to shine</i> by <i>the cloud</i> that cometh betwixt.
c74314	The noise thereof sheweth concerning
c74315	it, the cattle also concerning the vapour.
c74316	At this also my heart trembleth,
c74317	and is moved out of his place.
c74318	Hear attentively the noise of his voice,
c74319	and the sound <i>that</i> goeth out of his mouth.
c74320	He directeth it under the whole heaven,
c74321	and his lightning unto the ends of the earth.
c74322	After it a voice roareth:
c74323	he thundereth with the voice of his excellency;
c74324	and he will not stay
c74325	them when his voice is heard.
c74326	God thundereth marvellously with his voice;
c74327	great things doeth
c74328	he, which we cannot comprehend.
c74329	For he saith to the snow,
c74330	Be thou <i>on</i> the earth;
c74331	likewise to the small rain, and to the great rain of his strength.
c74332	He sealeth up the hand of every man;
c74333	that all men may know his work.
c74334	Then the beasts go into dens,
c74335	and remain in their places.
c74336	Out of the south cometh the whirlwind:
c74337	and cold out of the north.
c74338	By the breath of God frost is given:
c74339	and the breadth of the waters is straitened.
c74340	Also by watering he wearieth the thick cloud:
c74341	he scattereth his bright cloud:
c74342	And it is turned round about by his counsels:
c74343	that they may do
c74344	whatsoever
c74345	he commandeth
c74346	them upon the face of the world in the earth.
c74348	or for his land, or for mercy.
c74349	He causeth it to come, whether for correction,
c74350	Hearken unto this,
c74351	O Job:
c74352	stand still,
c74353	and consider the wondrous works of God.
c74354	Dost thou know
c74355	when God disposed
c74356	them, and caused the light of his cloud to shine?
c74357	Dost thou know the balancings of the clouds,
c74358	the wondrous works of him which is perfect in knowledge?
c74359	How thy garments <i>are</i> warm,
c74360	when he quieteth the earth by the south <i>wind?</i>
c74361	Hast thou with him spread out the sky,
c74362	<i>which is</i> strong, <i>and</i> as a molten looking glass?
c74363	Teach
c74364	us what we shall say
c74365	unto him; <i>for</i> we cannot order <i>our speech</i> by reason of darkness.
c74366	Shall it be told
c74367	him that I speak?
c74368	if a man speak,
c74369	surely he shall be swallowed up.
c74370	And now
c74371	<i>men</i> see not the bright light
c74372	which <i>is</i> in the clouds:
c74373	but the wind passeth,
c74374	and cleanseth them.
c74375	Fair weather cometh out of the north:
c74376	with God <i>is</i> terrible majesty.
c74377	<i>Touching</i> the Almighty,
c74378	we cannot find him out:
c74379	<i>he is</i> excellent in power,
c74380	and in judgment, and in plenty of justice: he will not afflict.
c74381	Men do therefore fear
c74382	him: he respecteth not any <i>that are</i> wise of heart.
c74383	Then the LORD answered Job out of the whirlwind,
c74384	and said,
c74385	Who <i>is</i> this that darkeneth counsel by words without knowledge?
c74386	Gird up now thy loins like a man;
c74387	for I will demand
c74388	of thee, and answer thou me.
c74389	Where wast
c74390	thou when I laid the foundations of the earth?
c74391	declare,
c74392	if thou hast understanding.
c74393	Who hath laid the measures
c74394	thereof, if thou knowest?
c74395	or who hath stretched the line upon it?
c74396	Whereupon are the foundations thereof fastened?
c74397	or who laid the corner stone thereof;
c74398	When the morning stars sang together,
c74399	and all the sons of God shouted for joy?
c74400	Or <i>who</i> shut up the sea with doors,
c74401	when it brake forth,
c74402	<i>as if</i> it had issued out of the womb?
c74403	When I made the cloud the garment
c74404	thereof, and thick darkness a swaddlingband for it,
c74405	And brake up for it my decreed
c74406	<i>place,</i> and set bars and doors,
c74407	And said,
c74408	Hitherto shalt thou come,
c74409	but no further:
c74410	and here shall thy proud waves be stayed?
c74411	Hast thou commanded the morning since thy days;
c74412	<i>and</i> caused the dayspring to know his place;
c74413	That it might take hold of the ends of the earth,
c74414	that the wicked might be shaken out of it?
c74415	It is turned as clay <i>to</i> the seal;
c74416	and they stand as a garment.
c74417	And from the wicked their light is withholden,
c74418	and the high arm shall be broken.
c74419	Hast thou entered into the springs of the sea?
c74420	or hast thou walked in the search of the depth?
c74421	Have the gates of death been opened
c74422	unto thee? or hast thou seen the doors of the shadow of death?
c74423	Hast thou perceived the breadth of the earth?
c74424	declare
c74425	if thou knowest it all.
c74426	Where <i>is</i> the way
c74427	<i>where</i> light dwelleth?
c74428	and <i>as for</i> darkness,
c74429	where <i>is</i> the place thereof,
c74430	That thou shouldest take it to the bound
c74431	thereof, and that thou shouldest know the paths <i>to</i> the house thereof?
c74432	Knowest
c74433	thou <i>it,</i> because thou wast then born?
c74434	or <i>because</i> the number of thy days <i>is</i> great?
c74435	Hast thou entered into the treasures of the snow?
c74436	or hast thou seen the treasures of the hail,
c74437	Which I have reserved against the time of trouble,
c74438	against the day of battle and war?
c74439	By what way
c74440	is the light parted,
c74441	<i>which</i> scattereth the east wind upon the earth?
c74442	Who hath divided a watercourse for the overflowing of waters,
c74443	or a way for the lightning of thunder;
c74444	To cause it to rain on the earth,
c74445	<i>where</i> no man
c74446	<i>is; on</i> the wilderness,
c74447	wherein <i>there is</i> no man;
c74448	To satisfy the desolate and waste
c74449	<i>ground;</i> and to cause the bud of the tender herb to spring forth?
c74450	Hath the rain a father?
c74451	or who hath begotten the drops of dew?
c74452	Out of whose womb came the ice?
c74453	and the hoary frost of heaven,
c74454	who hath gendered it?
c74455	The waters are hid as <i>with</i> a stone,
c74456	and the face of the deep is frozen.
c74457	Canst thou bind the sweet influences of Pleiades,
c74458	or loose the bands of Orion?
c74459	Canst thou bring forth Mazzaroth in his season?
c74460	Arcturus with his sons?
c74461	or canst thou guide
c74462	Knowest thou the ordinances of heaven?
c74463	canst thou set the dominion thereof in the earth?
c74464	Canst thou lift up thy voice to the clouds,
c74465	that abundance of waters may cover thee?
c74466	Canst thou send lightnings,
c74467	that they may go,
c74468	and say
c74469	unto thee, Here we <i>are?</i>
c74470	Who hath put wisdom in the inward parts?
c74471	or who hath given understanding to the heart?
c74472	Who can number the clouds in wisdom?
c74474	the bottles of heaven,
c74475	or who can stay
c74476	When the dust groweth into hardness,
c74477	and the clods cleave fast together?
c74478	Wilt thou hunt the prey for the lion?
c74479	or fill the appetite of the young lions,
c74480	When they couch in <i>their</i> dens,
c74481	<i>and</i> abide in the covert to lie in wait?
c74482	Who provideth for the raven his food?
c74483	when his young ones cry unto God,
c74484	they wander for lack of meat.
c74485	Knowest thou the time when the wild goats of the rock bring forth?
c74486	when the hinds do calve?
c74487	<i>or</i> canst thou mark
c74488	Canst thou number the months
c74489	<i>that</i> they fulfil?
c74490	or knowest thou the time
c74491	when they bring forth?
c74492	They bow
c74493	themselves, they bring forth their young ones,
c74494	they cast out their sorrows.
c74495	Their young ones are in good liking,
c74496	they grow up with corn;
c74497	they go forth,
c74498	and return not unto them.
c74499	Who hath sent out the wild ass free?
c74501	the bands of the wild ass?
c74502	or who hath loosed
c74503	Whose house I have made the wilderness,
c74504	and the barren land his dwellings.
c74505	He scorneth the multitude of the city,
c74506	neither regardeth he the crying of the driver.
c74507	The range of the mountains <i>is</i> his pasture,
c74508	and he searcheth after every green thing.
c74509	Will the unicorn be willing
c74510	to serve
c74511	thee, or abide by thy crib?
c74512	Canst thou bind the unicorn with his band in the furrow?
c74513	or will he harrow the valleys after thee?
c74514	Wilt thou trust
c74515	him, because his strength <i>is</i> great?
c74516	or wilt thou leave thy labour to him?
c74517	Wilt thou believe
c74518	him, that he will bring home thy seed,
c74519	and gather <i>it into</i> thy barn?
c74520	<i>Gavest thou</i> the goodly wings unto the peacocks?
c74521	or wings and feathers unto the ostrich?
c74522	Which leaveth her eggs in the earth,
c74523	and warmeth them in dust,
c74524	And forgetteth
c74525	that the foot may crush
c74526	them, or that the wild beast may break them.
c74527	She is hardened against her young ones,
c74528	as though <i>they were</i> not
c74529	hers: her labour is in vain without fear;
c74530	Because God hath deprived her of wisdom,
c74531	neither hath he imparted to her understanding.
c74532	What time
c74533	she lifteth up herself on high,
c74534	she scorneth the horse and his rider.
c74535	Hast thou given the horse strength?
c74536	hast thou clothed his neck with thunder?
c74537	Canst thou make him afraid as a grasshopper?
c74538	the glory of his nostrils <i>is</i> terrible.
c74539	He paweth in the valley,
c74540	and rejoiceth in <i>his</i> strength:
c74541	he goeth on
c74542	to meet the armed men.
c74543	He mocketh at fear,
c74544	and is not affrighted;
c74545	neither turneth he back from the sword.
c74546	The quiver rattleth against him, the glittering spear and the shield.
c74547	He swalloweth the ground with fierceness and rage:
c74548	neither believeth
c74549	he that <i>it is</i> the sound of the trumpet.
c74550	He saith among the trumpets,
c74551	Ha, ha;
c74552	and he smelleth the battle afar off, the thunder of the captains, and the shouting.
c74553	Doth the hawk fly by thy wisdom,
c74554	<i>and</i> stretch her wings toward the south?
c74555	Doth the eagle mount up at thy command,
c74556	and make her nest on high?
c74557	She dwelleth and abideth on the rock,
c74558	upon the crag of the rock, and the strong place.
c74559	From thence she seeketh the prey,
c74560	<i>and</i> her eyes behold afar off.
c74561	Her young ones also suck up blood:
c74562	and where the slain
c74563	<i>are,</i> there <i>is</i> she.
c74564	Moreover the LORD answered Job,
c74565	and said,
c74566	Shall he that contendeth with the Almighty instruct
c74567	<i>him?</i> he that reproveth God,
c74568	let him answer it.
c74569	Then Job answered the LORD,
c74570	and said,
c74571	Behold, I am vile;
c74572	what shall I answer
c74573	thee? I will lay mine hand upon my mouth.
c74574	Once have I spoken;
c74575	but I will not answer:
c74576	yea, twice;
c74577	but I will proceed no further.
c74578	Then answered the LORD unto Job out of the whirlwind,
c74579	and said,
c74580	Gird up thy loins now like a man:
c74581	I will demand
c74582	of thee, and declare thou unto me.
c74583	Wilt thou also disannul my judgment?
c74584	wilt thou condemn
c74585	me, that thou mayest be righteous?
c74586	Hast thou an arm like God?
c74587	or canst thou thunder with a voice like him?
c74588	Deck thyself now <i>with</i> majesty and excellency;
c74589	and array thyself with glory and beauty.
c74590	Cast abroad the rage of thy wrath:
c74591	and behold every one <i>that is</i> proud,
c74592	and abase him.
c74593	Look on every one <i>that is</i> proud,
c74594	<i>and</i> bring him low;
c74595	and tread down the wicked in their place.
c74596	Hide them in the dust together;
c74597	<i>and</i> bind their faces in secret.
c74598	Then will I also confess
c74599	unto thee that thine own right hand can save thee.
c74600	Behold now behemoth,
c74601	which I made with
c74602	thee; he eateth grass as an ox.
c74603	Lo now, his strength <i>is</i> in his loins,
c74604	and his force <i>is</i> in the navel of his belly.
c74605	He moveth his tail like a cedar:
c74606	the sinews of his stones are wrapped together.
c74607	His bones <i>are as</i> strong pieces of brass;
c74608	his bones <i>are</i> like bars of iron.
c74609	He <i>is</i> the chief of the ways of God:
c74610	he that made
c74611	him can make his sword to approach <i>unto him.</i>
c74612	Surely the mountains bring him forth food,
c74613	where all the beasts of the field play.
c74614	He lieth under the shady trees, in the covert of the reed, and fens.
c74615	The shady trees cover
c74616	him <i>with</i> their shadow;
c74617	the willows of the brook compass him about.
c74618	Behold, he drinketh up a river,
c74619	<i>and</i> hasteth not:
c74620	he trusteth
c74621	that he can draw up Jordan into his mouth.
c74622	He taketh it with his eyes:
c74623	<i>his</i> nose pierceth through snares.
c74624	Canst thou draw out leviathan with an hook?
c74625	or his tongue with a cord <i>which</i> thou lettest down?
c74626	Canst thou put an hook into his nose?
c74627	or bore his jaw through with a thorn?
c74628	Will he make many supplications unto
c74629	thee? will he speak soft <i>words</i> unto thee?
c74630	Will he make a covenant with
c74631	thee? wilt thou take him for a servant for ever?
c74632	Wilt thou play with him as <i>with</i> a bird?
c74633	or wilt thou bind him for thy maidens?
c74634	Shall the companions make a banquet of
c74635	him? shall they part him among the merchants?
c74636	Canst thou fill his skin with barbed irons?
c74637	or his head with fish spears?
c74638	Lay thine hand upon
c74639	him, remember the battle,
c74640	do no more.
c74641	Behold, the hope of him is in vain:
c74642	shall not <i>one</i> be cast down even at the sight of him?
c74643	None <i>is so</i> fierce
c74644	that dare stir him up:
c74645	who
c74646	then is able to stand before me?
c74647	Who hath prevented
c74648	me, that I should repay
c74649	<i>him? whatsoever is</i> under the whole heaven is mine.
c74651	I will not conceal his parts, nor his power, nor his comely proportion.
c74652	Who can discover the face of his garment?
c74653	<i>to him</i> with his double bridle?
c74654	<i>or</i> who can come
c74655	the doors of his face?
c74656	Who can open
c74657	his teeth <i>are</i> terrible round about.
c74658	<i>His</i> scales <i>are his</i> pride,
c74659	shut up together <i>as with</i> a close seal.
c74660	One is so near to another,
c74662	that no air can come between them.
c74663	one to another,
c74664	They are joined
c74665	they stick together,
c74666	that they cannot be sundered.
c74667	By his neesings a light doth shine,
c74668	and his eyes <i>are</i> like the eyelids of the morning.
c74669	Out of his mouth go burning lamps,
c74670	<i>and</i> sparks of fire leap out.
c74671	Out of his nostrils goeth smoke,
c74672	as <i>out</i> of a seething pot or caldron.
c74673	His breath kindleth coals,
c74674	and a flame goeth out of his mouth.
c74675	In his neck remaineth strength,
c74676	and sorrow is turned into joy before him.
c74677	The flakes of his flesh are joined together:
c74678	they are firm in
c74679	themselves; they cannot be moved.
c74680	His heart is as firm as a stone;
c74681	yea, as hard as a piece of the nether <i>millstone.</i>
c74682	When he raiseth up himself, the mighty are afraid:
c74683	by reason of breakings they purify themselves.
c74684	The sword of him that layeth
c74685	at him cannot hold:
c74686	the spear, the dart, nor the habergeon.
c74687	He esteemeth iron as straw,
c74688	<i>and</i> brass as rotten wood.
c74689	The arrow cannot make him flee:
c74690	slingstones are turned with him into stubble.
c74691	Darts are counted as stubble:
c74692	he laugheth at the shaking of a spear.
c74693	Sharp stones <i>are</i> under
c74694	him: he spreadeth sharp pointed things upon the mire.
c74695	He maketh the deep to boil like a pot:
c74696	he maketh the sea like a pot of ointment.
c74697	He maketh a path to shine after
c74698	him; <i>one</i> would think the deep <i>to be</i> hoary.
c74699	Upon earth there is not his like,
c74700	who is made without fear.
c74701	He beholdeth all high
c74702	<i>things:</i> he <i>is</i> a king over all the children of pride.
c74703	Then Job answered the LORD,
c74704	and said,
c74705	I know
c74706	that thou canst do every
c74707	<i>thing,</i> and <i>that</i> no thought can be withholden from thee.
c74708	Who <i>is</i> he that hideth counsel without knowledge?
c74709	therefore have I uttered
c74710	that I understood not;
c74711	things too wonderful for
c74712	me, which I knew not.
c74713	Hear, I beseech thee,
c74714	and I will speak:
c74715	I will demand
c74716	of thee, and declare thou unto me.
c74717	I have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear:
c74718	but now mine eye seeth thee.
c74719	Wherefore I abhor
c74720	<i>myself,</i> and repent in dust and ashes.
c74721	And it was
c74722	<i>so,</i> that after the LORD had spoken these words unto Job,
c74723	the LORD said to Eliphaz the Temanite,
c74724	My wrath is kindled against thee, and against thy two friends:
c74725	for ye have not spoken of me <i>the thing that is</i> right, as my servant Job <i>hath.</i>
c74727	Therefore take unto you now seven bullocks and seven rams,
c74728	and go to my servant Job,
c74729	and offer up for yourselves a burnt offering;
c74730	and my servant Job shall pray for
c74731	you: for him will I accept:
c74732	lest I deal with you <i>after your</i> folly,
c74733	in that ye have not spoken of me <i>the thing which is</i> right, like my servant Job.
c74734	So Eliphaz the Temanite and Bildad the Shuhite <i>and</i> Zophar the Naamathite went,
c74735	and did
c74736	according as the LORD commanded
c74737	them: the LORD also accepted Job.
c74738	And the LORD turned the captivity of Job,
c74739	when he prayed for his friends:
c74740	also the LORD gave Job
c74742	twice as much as he had before.
c74743	Then came there unto him all his brethren, and all his sisters, and all they that had been of his acquaintance before,
c74744	and did eat bread with him in his house:
c74745	and they bemoaned
c74746	him, and comforted him over all the evil
c74747	that the LORD had brought upon
c74749	him: every man also gave him a piece of money,
c74750	and every one an earring of gold.
c74751	So the LORD blessed the latter end of Job more than his beginning:
c74752	for he had fourteen thousand sheep, and six thousand camels, and a thousand yoke of oxen, and a thousand she asses.
c74753	He had also seven sons and three daughters.
c74754	And he called the name of the first, Jemima;
c74755	and the name of the second, Kezia;
c74756	and the name of the third, Kerenhappuch.
c74757	And in all the land were no women found <i>so</i> fair as the daughters of Job:
c74758	and their father gave them inheritance among their brethren.
c74759	After this lived Job an hundred and forty years,
c74760	and saw his sons, and his sons' sons,
c74761	<i>even</i> four generations.
c74762	So Job died, <i>being</i> old and full of days.
c74763	The proverbs of Solomon the son of David, king of Israel;
c74764	To know wisdom and instruction;
c74765	to perceive the words of understanding;
c74766	To receive the instruction of wisdom,
c74767	justice, and judgment, and equity;
c74768	To give subtilty to the simple,
c74769	to the young man knowledge and discretion.
c74770	A wise <i>man</i> will hear,
c74771	and will increase learning;
c74772	and a man of understanding shall attain unto wise counsels:
c74773	To understand a proverb, and the interpretation;
c74774	the words of the wise, and their dark sayings.
c74775	The fear of the LORD <i>is</i> the beginning of knowledge:
c74776	<i>but</i> fools despise wisdom and instruction.
c74777	hear
c74778	My son,
c74779	the instruction of thy father,
c74780	and forsake not the law of thy mother:
c74781	For they <i>shall be</i> an ornament of grace unto thy head,
c74782	and chains about thy neck.
c74783	My son,
c74784	if sinners entice
c74785	thee, consent thou not.
c74786	If they say,
c74787	Come with
c74788	us, let us lay wait for blood,
c74789	let us lurk privily for the innocent without cause:
c74790	Let us swallow them up alive as the grave;
c74791	and whole, as those that go down into the pit:
c74792	We shall find all precious substance,
c74793	we shall fill our houses with spoil:
c74794	Cast in thy lot among
c74795	us; let us all have one purse:
c74796	My son,
c74797	walk not thou in the way with
c74798	them; refrain thy foot from their path:
c74799	For their feet run to evil,
c74800	and make haste
c74801	to shed blood.
c74802	Surely in vain the net is spread in the sight of any bird.
c74803	And they lay wait for their <i>own</i> blood;
c74804	they lurk privily for their <i>own</i> lives.
c74805	So <i>are</i> the ways of every one
c74806	that is greedy of gain;
c74807	<i>which</i> taketh away the life of the owners thereof.
c74808	Wisdom crieth without;
c74809	she uttereth her voice in the streets:
c74810	She crieth in the chief place of concourse,
c74811	in the openings of the gates: in the city she uttereth her words, <i>saying,</i>
c74812	How long,
c74813	ye simple ones,
c74814	will ye love simplicity?
c74815	and the scorners delight in their scorning,
c74816	and fools hate knowledge?
c74817	Turn you at my reproof:
c74818	behold, I will pour out my spirit
c74819	unto you, I will make known my words unto you.
c74820	Because I have called,
c74821	and ye refused;
c74822	I have stretched out my hand,
c74823	and no man regarded;
c74824	But ye have set at nought all my counsel,
c74825	and would none of my reproof:
c74826	I also will laugh at your calamity;
c74827	I will mock
c74828	when your fear cometh;
c74829	When your fear cometh as desolation,
c74830	and your destruction cometh as a whirlwind;
c74831	when distress and anguish cometh upon you.
c74832	Then shall they call upon
c74833	me, but I will not answer;
c74834	they shall seek me early,
c74835	but they shall not find me:
c74836	For that they hated knowledge,
c74837	and did not choose the fear of the LORD:
c74838	They would none of my counsel:
c74839	they despised all my reproof.
c74840	Therefore shall they eat of the fruit of their own way,
c74841	and be filled with their own devices.
c74842	For the turning away of the simple shall slay
c74843	them, and the prosperity of fools shall destroy them.
c74845	But whoso hearkeneth
c74846	unto me shall dwell safely,
c74847	and shall be quiet from fear of evil.
c74848	My son,
c74849	if thou wilt receive my words,
c74850	and hide my commandments with thee;
c74851	So that thou incline thine ear unto wisdom,
c74852	<i>and</i> apply thine heart to understanding;
c74853	Yea,
c74854	if thou criest after knowledge,
c74855	<i>and</i> liftest up thy voice for understanding;
c74856	If thou seekest her as silver,
c74857	and searchest for her as <i>for</i> hid treasures;
c74858	Then shalt thou understand the fear of the LORD,
c74859	and find the knowledge of God.
c74860	For the LORD giveth wisdom:
c74861	out of his mouth <i>cometh</i> knowledge and understanding.
c74862	He layeth up sound wisdom for the righteous:
c74863	<i>he is</i> a buckler to them that walk uprightly.
c74864	He keepeth the paths of judgment,
c74865	and preserveth the way of his saints.
c74866	Then shalt thou understand righteousness, and judgment,
c74867	and equity; <i>yea,</i> every good path.
c74868	When wisdom entereth into thine heart,
c74869	and knowledge is pleasant unto thy soul;
c74870	Discretion shall preserve
c74871	thee, understanding shall keep thee:
c74872	To deliver thee from the way of the evil
c74873	<i>man,</i> from the man
c74874	that speaketh froward things;
c74875	Who leave the paths of uprightness,
c74876	to walk in the ways of darkness;
c74877	Who rejoice
c74878	to do evil,
c74879	<i>and</i> delight in the frowardness of the wicked;
c74880	Whose ways <i>are</i> crooked,
c74881	and <i>they</i> froward in their paths:
c74882	To deliver thee from the strange woman,
c74883	<i>even</i> from the stranger
c74884	<i>which</i> flattereth with her words;
c74885	Which forsaketh the guide of her youth,
c74886	and forgetteth the covenant of her God.
c74887	For her house inclineth unto death,
c74888	and her paths unto the dead.
c74889	None that go unto her return again,
c74890	neither take they hold of the paths of life.
c74891	That thou mayest walk in the way of good
c74892	<i>men,</i> and keep the paths of the righteous.
c74893	For the upright shall dwell in the land,
c74894	and the perfect shall remain in it.
c74895	But the wicked shall be cut off from the earth,
c74896	and the transgressors shall be rooted out of it.
c74897	My son,
c74898	forget not my law;
c74899	but let thine heart keep my commandments:
c74900	For length of days, and long life, and peace, shall they add to thee.
c74901	Let not mercy and truth forsake
c74902	thee: bind them about thy neck;
c74903	write them upon the table of thine heart:
c74904	So shalt thou find favour and good understanding in the sight of God and man.
c74905	Trust in the LORD with all thine heart;
c74906	and lean not unto thine own understanding.
c74907	In all thy ways acknowledge
c74908	him, and he shall direct thy paths.
c74909	Be not wise in thine own eyes:
c74910	fear the LORD,
c74911	and depart from evil.
c74912	It shall be health to thy navel,
c74913	and marrow to thy bones.
c74914	Honour the LORD with thy substance, and with the firstfruits of all thine increase:
c74915	So shall thy barns be filled with plenty,
c74916	and thy presses shall burst out with new wine.
c74917	the chastening of the LORD;
c74918	My son,
c74919	despise not
c74920	neither be weary of his correction:
c74921	For
c74922	whom the LORD loveth
c74923	he correcteth;
c74924	even as a father the son
c74925	<i>in whom</i> he delighteth.
c74926	Happy <i>is</i> the man
c74927	<i>that</i> findeth wisdom,
c74928	and the man
c74929	<i>that</i> getteth understanding.
c74930	For the merchandise of it <i>is</i> better than the merchandise of silver,
c74931	and the gain thereof than fine gold.
c74932	She <i>is</i> more precious than rubies:
c74933	and all the things thou canst desire are not to be compared unto her.
c74934	Length of days <i>is</i> in her right hand;
c74935	<i>and</i> in her left hand riches and honour.
c74936	Her ways <i>are</i> ways of pleasantness,
c74937	and all her paths <i>are</i> peace.
c74938	She <i>is</i> a tree of life
c74939	to them that lay hold
c74941	<i>is every one</i> that retaineth her.
c74942	upon her: and happy
c74943	The LORD by wisdom hath founded the earth;
c74944	by understanding hath he established the heavens.
c74945	By his knowledge the depths are broken up,
c74946	and the clouds drop down the dew.
c74947	My son,
c74948	let not them depart from thine eyes:
c74949	keep sound wisdom and discretion:
c74950	So shall they be life unto thy soul,
c74951	and grace to thy neck.
c74952	Then shalt thou walk in thy way safely,
c74953	and thy foot shall not stumble.
c74954	When thou liest down,
c74955	thou shalt not be afraid:
c74956	yea, thou shalt lie down,
c74957	and thy sleep shall be sweet.
c74958	Be not afraid of sudden fear,
c74959	neither of the desolation of the wicked,
c74960	when it cometh.
c74961	For the LORD shall be thy confidence,
c74962	and shall keep thy foot from being taken.
c74963	Withhold not good from them to whom it is due,
c74964	when it is in the power of thine hand
c74965	to do <i>it.</i>
c74966	Say not unto thy neighbour,
c74967	Go,
c74968	and come again,
c74969	and to morrow I will give;
c74970	when thou hast it by thee.
c74971	Devise not evil against thy neighbour,
c74972	seeing he dwelleth securely by thee.
c74973	Strive not with a man without cause,
c74974	if he have done thee no harm.
c74975	Envy thou not the oppressor,
c74976	and choose none of his ways.
c74977	For the froward <i>is</i> abomination to the LORD:
c74978	but his secret <i>is</i> with the righteous.
c74979	The curse of the LORD <i>is</i> in the house of the wicked:
c74980	but he blesseth the habitation of the just.
c74981	Surely he scorneth the scorners:
c74982	but he giveth grace unto the lowly.
c74983	The wise shall inherit glory:
c74984	but shame shall be the promotion of fools.
c74985	Hear,
c74986	ye children,
c74987	the instruction of a father,
c74988	and attend
c74989	to know understanding.
c74990	For I give you good doctrine,
c74991	forsake ye not my law.
c74992	For I was my father's son,
c74993	tender and only <i>beloved</i> in the sight of my mother.
c74994	He taught
c74995	me also, and said
c74996	unto me, Let thine heart retain my words:
c74997	keep my commandments,
c74998	and live.
c74999	Get wisdom,
c75000	get understanding:
c75001	forget <i>it</i> not;
c75002	neither decline from the words of my mouth.
c75003	Forsake her not,
c75004	and she shall preserve
c75005	thee: love
c75006	her, and she shall keep thee.
c75007	Wisdom <i>is</i> the principal thing;
c75008	<i>therefore</i> get wisdom:
c75009	and with all thy getting get understanding.
c75010	Exalt
c75011	her, and she shall promote
c75012	thee: she shall bring thee to honour,
c75013	when thou dost embrace her.
c75014	She shall give to thine head an ornament of grace:
c75015	a crown of glory shall she deliver to thee.
c75016	Hear,
c75017	O my son,
c75018	and receive my sayings;
c75019	and the years of thy life shall be many.
c75020	I have taught thee in the way of wisdom;
c75021	I have led thee in right paths.
c75022	When thou goest,
c75023	thy steps shall not be straitened;
c75025	and when thou runnest,
c75026	thou shalt not stumble.
c75027	Take fast hold of instruction;
c75028	let <i>her</i> not go:
c75029	keep
c75030	her; for she <i>is</i> thy life.
c75031	Enter not into the path of the wicked,
c75032	and go not in the way of evil <i>men.</i>
c75033	Avoid
c75034	it, pass not
c75035	by it, turn from
c75036	it, and pass away.
c75037	For they sleep not,
c75038	except they have done mischief;
c75039	and their sleep is taken away,
c75040	unless they cause <i>some</i> to fall.
c75041	For they eat the bread of wickedness,
c75042	and drink the wine of violence.
c75043	But the path of the just <i>is</i> as the shining light,
c75045	that shineth more and more unto the perfect day.
c75046	The way of the wicked <i>is</i> as darkness:
c75047	they know not
c75048	at what they stumble.
c75049	My son,
c75050	attend to my words;
c75051	incline thine ear unto my sayings.
c75052	Let them not depart from thine eyes;
c75053	keep them in the midst of thine heart.
c75054	For they <i>are</i> life unto those that find
c75055	them, and health to all their flesh.
c75056	Keep thy heart with all diligence;
c75057	for out of it <i>are</i> the issues of life.
c75058	Put away from thee a froward mouth,
c75059	and perverse lips put far from thee.
c75060	Let thine eyes look right on,
c75061	and let thine eyelids look straight before thee.
c75062	Ponder the path of thy feet,
c75063	and let all thy ways be established.
c75064	Turn not to the right hand nor to the left:
c75065	remove thy foot from evil.
c75066	My son,
c75067	attend unto my wisdom,
c75068	<i>and</i> bow thine ear to my understanding:
c75069	That thou mayest regard discretion,
c75070	and <i>that</i> thy lips may keep knowledge.
c75071	For the lips of a strange woman drop <i>as</i> an honeycomb,
c75072	and her mouth <i>is</i> smoother than oil:
c75073	But her end is bitter as wormwood,
c75074	sharp as a twoedged sword.
c75075	Her feet go down to death;
c75076	her steps take hold on hell.
c75077	the path of life,
c75078	Lest thou shouldest ponder
c75079	her ways are moveable,
c75080	<i>that</i> thou canst not know <i>them.</i>
c75081	me now
c75082	therefore, O ye children,
c75083	Hear
c75084	and depart not from the words of my mouth.
c75085	Remove thy way far from
c75086	her, and come not nigh the door of her house:
c75087	Lest thou give thine honour unto others,
c75088	and thy years unto the cruel:
c75089	Lest strangers be filled with thy wealth;
c75090	and thy labours <i>be</i> in the house of a stranger;
c75091	And thou mourn at the last,
c75092	when thy flesh and thy body are consumed,
c75093	And say,
c75094	How have I hated instruction,
c75095	and my heart despised reproof;
c75096	And have not obeyed the voice of my teachers,
c75097	nor inclined mine ear to them that instructed me!
c75098	I was almost in all evil in the midst of the congregation and assembly.
c75099	Drink waters out of thine own cistern,
c75100	and running waters out of thine own well.
c75101	Let thy fountains be dispersed abroad,
c75102	<i>and</i> rivers of waters in the streets.
c75103	Let them be only
c75104	thine own, and not strangers' with thee.
c75105	Let thy fountain be blessed:
c75106	and rejoice with the wife of thy youth.
c75107	<i>Let her be as</i> the loving hind and pleasant roe;
c75108	let her breasts satisfy thee at all times;
c75109	and be thou ravished always with her love.
c75110	And why wilt thou, my son, be ravished
c75112	with a strange woman,
c75113	and embrace the bosom of a stranger?
c75114	For the ways of man <i>are</i> before the eyes of the LORD,
c75115	and he pondereth all his goings.
c75116	His own iniquities shall take the wicked
c75117	himself, and he shall be holden with the cords of his sins.
c75118	He shall die without instruction;
c75119	and in the greatness of his folly he shall go astray.
c75120	My son,
c75121	if thou be surety for thy friend,
c75122	<i>if</i> thou hast stricken thy hand with a stranger,
c75123	Thou art snared with the words of thy mouth,
c75124	thou art taken with the words of thy mouth.
c75125	Do this now,
c75126	my son,
c75127	and deliver thyself,
c75128	when thou art come into the hand of thy friend;
c75129	go,
c75130	humble thyself,
c75131	and make sure thy friend.
c75132	Give not sleep to thine eyes,
c75133	nor slumber to thine eyelids.
c75134	Deliver thyself as a roe from the hand
c75135	<i>of the hunter,</i> and as a bird from the hand of the fowler.
c75136	Go to the ant,
c75137	thou sluggard;
c75138	consider her ways,
c75139	and be wise:
c75140	Which having no guide, overseer, or ruler,
c75141	Provideth her meat in the summer,
c75142	<i>and</i> gathereth her food in the harvest.
c75143	How long
c75144	O sluggard?
c75145	wilt thou sleep,
c75146	when wilt thou arise out of thy sleep?
c75147	<i>Yet</i> a little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands
c75148	to sleep:
c75149	So shall thy poverty come as one that travelleth,
c75150	and thy want as an armed man.
c75151	A naughty person, a wicked man,
c75152	walketh with a froward mouth.
c75153	He winketh with his eyes,
c75154	he speaketh with his feet,
c75155	he teacheth with his fingers;
c75156	Frowardness <i>is</i> in his heart,
c75157	he deviseth mischief continually;
c75158	he soweth discord.
c75159	Therefore shall his calamity come suddenly;
c75160	suddenly shall he be broken
c75161	without remedy.
c75162	These six
c75163	<i>things</i> doth the LORD hate:
c75164	yea, seven <i>are</i> an abomination unto him:
c75165	A proud look, a lying tongue, and hands
c75166	that shed innocent blood,
c75167	An heart
c75168	that deviseth wicked imaginations,
c75169	feet
c75170	that be swift
c75171	in running to mischief,
c75172	A false witness <i>that</i> speaketh lies,
c75173	and he that soweth discord among brethren.
c75174	keep
c75175	My son,
c75176	thy father's commandment,
c75177	and forsake not the law of thy mother:
c75178	Bind them continually upon thine heart,
c75179	<i>and</i> tie them about thy neck.
c75180	When thou goest,
c75181	it shall lead
c75182	thee; when thou sleepest,
c75183	it shall keep
c75184	thee; and <i>when</i> thou awakest,
c75185	it shall talk with thee.
c75186	For the commandment <i>is</i> a lamp;
c75187	and the law <i>is</i> light;
c75188	and reproofs of instruction <i>are</i> the way of life:
c75189	To keep thee from the evil woman,
c75190	from the flattery of the tongue of a strange woman.
c75191	Lust not after her beauty in thine heart;
c75192	neither let her take thee with her eyelids.
c75193	For by means of a whorish woman <i>a man is brought</i> to a piece of bread:
c75194	and the adulteress will hunt for the precious life.
c75195	Can a man take fire in his bosom,
c75196	and his clothes not be burned?
c75197	Can one go upon hot coals,
c75198	and his feet not be burned?
c75199	So
c75200	he that goeth in to his neighbour's wife;
c75201	whosoever toucheth her shall not be innocent.
c75203	<i>Men</i> do not despise a thief,
c75204	if he steal
c75205	to satisfy his soul
c75206	when he is hungry;
c75207	But <i>if</i> he be found,
c75208	he shall restore sevenfold;
c75209	he shall give all the substance of his house.
c75210	<i>But</i> whoso committeth adultery with a woman
c75211	lacketh understanding:
c75212	it destroyeth his own soul.
c75213	he <i>that</i> doeth
c75214	A wound and dishonour shall he get;
c75215	and his reproach shall not be wiped away.
c75216	For jealousy <i>is</i> the rage of a man:
c75217	therefore he will not spare in the day of vengeance.
c75218	He will not regard any ransom;
c75219	neither will he rest content,
c75220	though thou givest many gifts.
c75221	My son,
c75222	keep my words,
c75223	and lay up my commandments with thee.
c75224	Keep my commandments,
c75225	and live;
c75226	and my law as the apple of thine eye.
c75227	Bind them upon thy fingers,
c75228	write them upon the table of thine heart.
c75229	Say unto wisdom,
c75230	Thou <i>art</i> my sister;
c75231	and call understanding <i>thy</i> kinswoman:
c75232	That they may keep thee from the strange woman,
c75233	from the stranger
c75234	<i>which</i> flattereth with her words.
c75235	For at the window of my house I looked through my casement,
c75236	And beheld among the simple ones,
c75237	I discerned among the youths, a young man void of understanding,
c75238	Passing through the street near her corner;
c75239	and he went the way to her house,
c75240	In the twilight, in the evening, in the black and dark night:
c75241	And, behold, there met him a woman
c75243	<i>with</i> the attire of an harlot,
c75244	and subtil of heart.
c75245	(She <i>is</i> loud
c75246	and stubborn;
c75247	her feet abide not in her house:
c75248	Now <i>is she</i> without,
c75249	now in the streets,
c75250	and lieth in wait at every corner.)
c75251	So she caught
c75252	him, and kissed
c75253	him, <i>and</i> with an impudent face
c75254	said unto him,
c75255	<i>I have</i> peace offerings with
c75256	me; this day have I payed my vows.
c75257	Therefore came I forth
c75258	to meet
c75259	thee, diligently to seek thy face,
c75260	and I have found thee.
c75261	I have decked my bed with coverings of tapestry,
c75262	with carved <i>works,</i> with fine linen of Egypt.
c75263	I have perfumed my bed with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon.
c75264	Come,
c75265	let us take our fill of love until the morning:
c75266	let us solace ourselves with loves.
c75267	For the goodman <i>is</i> not at home,
c75268	he is gone a long journey:
c75269	He hath taken a bag of money with
c75270	him, <i>and</i> will come home at the day appointed.
c75271	With her much fair speech she caused him to yield,
c75272	with the flattering of her lips she forced him.
c75273	He goeth after her straightway,
c75274	as an ox goeth to the slaughter,
c75275	or as a fool to the correction of the stocks;
c75276	Till a dart strike through his liver;
c75277	as a bird hasteth to the snare,
c75278	and knoweth not
c75279	that it <i>is</i> for his life.
c75280	unto me now
c75281	therefore, O ye children,
c75282	Hearken
c75283	and attend to the words of my mouth.
c75284	Let not thine heart decline to her ways,
c75285	go not astray in her paths.
c75286	For she hath cast down many wounded:
c75287	yea, many strong <i>men</i> have been slain by her.
c75288	Her house <i>is</i> the way to hell,
c75289	going down to the chambers of death.
c75290	Doth not wisdom cry?
c75291	and understanding put forth her voice?
c75292	She standeth in the top of high places, by the way in the places of the paths.
c75293	She crieth at the gates, at the entry of the city, at the coming in at the doors.
c75294	Unto
c75295	you, O men,
c75296	I call;
c75297	and my voice <i>is</i> to the sons of man.
c75298	understand
c75299	O ye simple,
c75300	wisdom:
c75302	and, ye fools,
c75303	be ye of an understanding heart.
c75304	Hear;
c75305	for I will speak of excellent things;
c75306	and the opening of my lips <i>shall be</i> right things.
c75307	For my mouth shall speak truth;
c75308	and wickedness <i>is</i> an abomination to my lips.
c75309	All the words of my mouth <i>are</i> in righteousness;
c75310	<i>there is</i> nothing froward or perverse in them.
c75311	They <i>are</i> all plain to him that understandeth,
c75312	and right to them that find knowledge.
c75313	Receive my instruction,
c75314	and not silver;
c75315	and knowledge rather than choice gold.
c75316	For wisdom <i>is</i> better than rubies;
c75317	and all the things that may be desired are not to be compared to it.
c75318	I wisdom dwell with prudence,
c75319	and find out knowledge of witty inventions.
c75320	The fear of the LORD <i>is</i> to hate evil:
c75321	pride, and arrogancy, and the evil way, and the froward mouth, do I hate.
c75322	Counsel <i>is</i> mine, and sound wisdom:
c75323	I <i>am</i> understanding;
c75324	I have strength.
c75325	By me kings reign,
c75326	and princes decree justice.
c75327	By me princes rule,
c75328	and nobles, <i>even</i> all the judges of the earth.
c75329	I love them that love
c75330	me; and those that seek me early shall find me.
c75331	Riches and honour <i>are</i> with
c75332	me; <i>yea,</i> durable riches and righteousness.
c75333	My fruit <i>is</i> better than gold, yea, than fine gold;
c75334	and my revenue than choice silver.
c75335	I lead in the way of righteousness,
c75336	in the midst of the paths of judgment:
c75337	That I may cause those that love me to inherit substance;
c75338	and I will fill their treasures.
c75339	The LORD possessed me in the beginning of his way,
c75340	before his works of old.
c75341	I was set up from everlasting,
c75342	from the beginning, or ever the earth was.
c75343	When <i>there were</i> no depths, I was brought forth;
c75344	when <i>there were</i> no fountains abounding with water.
c75345	Before the mountains were settled,
c75346	before the hills was I brought forth:
c75347	While as yet he had not made the earth, nor the fields,
c75348	nor the highest part of the dust of the world.
c75349	When he prepared the heavens,
c75350	I <i>was</i> there:
c75351	when he set a compass upon the face of the depth:
c75352	When he established the clouds above:
c75353	when he strengthened the fountains of the deep:
c75354	When he gave to the sea his decree,
c75355	that the waters should not pass his commandment:
c75356	when he appointed the foundations of the earth:
c75357	Then I was by him, <i>as</i> one brought up
c75358	<i>with him:</i> and I was daily <i>his</i> delight,
c75359	rejoicing always before him;
c75360	Rejoicing in the habitable part of his earth;
c75361	and my delights <i>were</i> with the sons of men.
c75362	Now
c75363	unto me, O ye children:
c75364	therefore hearken
c75365	for blessed
c75366	<i>are they that</i> keep my ways.
c75367	Hear instruction,
c75368	and be wise,
c75369	and refuse it not.
c75370	Blessed <i>is</i> the man
c75371	that heareth
c75372	me, watching daily at my gates,
c75373	waiting at the posts of my doors.
c75374	For
c75375	whoso findeth
c75376	me findeth life,
c75377	and shall obtain favour of the LORD.
c75379	But he that sinneth against
c75380	me wrongeth his own soul:
c75381	all they that hate me love death.
c75382	Wisdom hath builded her house,
c75383	she hath hewn out her seven pillars:
c75384	She hath killed her beasts;
c75385	she hath mingled her wine;
c75386	she hath also furnished her table.
c75387	She hath sent forth her maidens:
c75388	she crieth upon the highest places of the city,
c75389	Whoso <i>is</i> simple,
c75390	let him turn in hither:
c75391	<i>as for</i> him that wanteth understanding,
c75392	she saith to him,
c75393	Come,
c75394	eat of my bread,
c75395	and drink of the wine
c75396	<i>which</i> I have mingled.
c75397	Forsake the foolish,
c75398	and live;
c75399	and go in the way of understanding.
c75400	He that reproveth a scorner
c75401	getteth to himself shame:
c75403	and he that rebuketh a wicked
c75404	<i>man getteth</i> himself a blot.
c75405	Reprove not a scorner,
c75406	lest he hate
c75407	thee: rebuke a wise man,
c75408	and he will love thee.
c75409	Give <i>instruction</i> to a wise
c75410	<i>man,</i> and he will be yet wiser:
c75411	teach a just
c75412	<i>man,</i> and he will increase in learning.
c75413	The fear of the LORD <i>is</i> the beginning of wisdom:
c75414	and the knowledge of the holy <i>is</i> understanding.
c75415	For by me thy days shall be multiplied,
c75416	and the years of thy life shall be increased.
c75417	If thou be wise,
c75418	thou shalt be wise
c75419	for thyself: but <i>if</i> thou scornest,
c75420	thou alone shalt bear <i>it.</i>
c75421	A foolish woman <i>is</i> clamorous:
c75422	<i>she is</i> simple,
c75423	and knoweth nothing.
c75424	For she sitteth at the door of her house, on a seat in the high places of the city,
c75425	To call passengers
c75426	who go right on their ways:
c75427	Whoso <i>is</i> simple,
c75428	let him turn in hither:
c75429	and <i>as for</i> him that wanteth understanding,
c75430	she saith to him,
c75431	Stolen waters are sweet,
c75432	and bread <i>eaten</i> in secret is pleasant.
c75433	But he knoweth not
c75434	that the dead <i>are</i> there;
c75435	<i>and that</i> her guests <i>are</i> in the depths of hell.
c75436	The proverbs of Solomon.
c75437	A wise son maketh a glad father:
c75438	but a foolish son <i>is</i> the heaviness of his mother.
c75439	Treasures of wickedness profit nothing:
c75440	but righteousness delivereth from death.
c75441	The LORD will not suffer the soul of the righteous to famish:
c75442	but he casteth away the substance of the wicked.
c75443	He becometh poor that dealeth <i>with</i> a slack hand:
c75444	but the hand of the diligent maketh rich.
c75445	He that gathereth in summer
c75446	<i>is</i> a wise son:
c75447	<i>but</i> he that sleepeth in harvest
c75448	<i>is</i> a son that causeth shame.
c75449	Blessings <i>are</i> upon the head of the just:
c75450	but violence covereth the mouth of the wicked.
c75451	The memory of the just <i>is</i> blessed:
c75452	but the name of the wicked shall rot.
c75453	The wise in heart will receive commandments:
c75454	but a prating fool shall fall.
c75455	He that walketh uprightly
c75456	walketh surely:
c75458	but he that perverteth his ways
c75459	shall be known.
c75460	He that winketh with the eye
c75461	causeth sorrow:
c75462	but a prating fool shall fall.
c75463	The mouth of a righteous <i>man is</i> a well of life:
c75464	but violence covereth the mouth of the wicked.
c75465	Hatred stirreth up strifes:
c75466	but love covereth all sins.
c75467	In the lips of him that hath understanding wisdom is found:
c75468	but a rod <i>is</i> for the back of him that is void of understanding.
c75469	Wise <i>men</i> lay up knowledge:
c75470	but the mouth of the foolish <i>is</i> near destruction.
c75471	The rich man's wealth <i>is</i> his strong city:
c75472	the destruction of the poor <i>is</i> their poverty.
c75473	The labour of the righteous <i>tendeth</i> to life:
c75474	the fruit of the wicked to sin.
c75475	He <i>is in</i> the way of life that keepeth instruction:
c75476	but he that refuseth reproof erreth.
c75477	He that hideth hatred
c75478	<i>with</i> lying lips,
c75479	and he that uttereth a slander,
c75480	<i>is</i> a fool.
c75481	In the multitude of words there wanteth not sin:
c75482	but he that refraineth his lips <i>is</i> wise.
c75483	The tongue of the just <i>is as</i> choice silver:
c75484	the heart of the wicked <i>is</i> little worth.
c75485	The lips of the righteous feed many:
c75486	but fools die for want of wisdom.
c75487	The blessing of the LORD,
c75488	it maketh rich,
c75489	and he addeth no sorrow with it.
c75490	<i>It is</i> as sport to a fool
c75491	to do mischief:
c75492	hath wisdom.
c75493	but a man of understanding
c75494	The fear of the wicked,
c75495	it shall come upon
c75496	him: but the desire of the righteous shall be granted.
c75497	As the whirlwind passeth,
c75498	no
c75499	so <i>is</i> the wicked
c75500	<i>more:</i> but the righteous <i>is</i> an everlasting foundation.
c75501	As vinegar to the teeth,
c75502	and as smoke to the eyes,
c75503	so <i>is</i> the sluggard to them that send him.
c75504	The fear of the LORD prolongeth days:
c75505	but the years of the wicked shall be shortened.
c75506	The hope of the righteous <i>shall be</i> gladness:
c75507	but the expectation of the wicked shall perish.
c75508	The way of the LORD <i>is</i> strength to the upright:
c75509	but destruction <i>shall be</i> to the workers of iniquity.
c75510	The righteous
c75511	shall never be removed:
c75512	but the wicked
c75513	shall not inhabit the earth.
c75514	The mouth of the just bringeth forth wisdom:
c75515	but the froward tongue shall be cut out.
c75516	The lips of the righteous know what is acceptable:
c75517	but the mouth of the wicked <i>speaketh</i> frowardness.
c75518	A false balance <i>is</i> abomination to the LORD:
c75519	but a just weight <i>is</i> his delight.
c75520	<i>When</i> pride cometh,
c75521	then cometh shame:
c75522	but with the lowly <i>is</i> wisdom.
c75523	The integrity of the upright shall guide
c75524	them: but the perverseness of transgressors shall destroy them.
c75525	Riches profit not in the day of wrath:
c75526	but righteousness delivereth from death.
c75527	The righteousness of the perfect shall direct his way:
c75528	but the wicked shall fall by his own wickedness.
c75529	The righteousness of the upright shall deliver
c75530	them: but transgressors shall be taken in <i>their own</i> naughtiness.
c75531	When a wicked man dieth, <i>his</i> expectation shall perish:
c75532	and the hope of unjust <i>men</i> perisheth.
c75533	The righteous is delivered out of trouble,
c75534	and the wicked cometh in his stead.
c75535	An hypocrite with <i>his</i> mouth destroyeth his neighbour:
c75536	but through knowledge shall the just be delivered.
c75537	When it goeth well with the righteous, the city rejoiceth:
c75539	and when the wicked perish,
c75540	<i>there is</i> shouting.
c75541	By the blessing of the upright the city is exalted:
c75542	but it is overthrown by the mouth of the wicked.
c75543	He that is void of wisdom despiseth his neighbour:
c75544	but a man of understanding holdeth his peace.
c75545	A talebearer
c75546	revealeth secrets:
c75547	but he that is of a faithful spirit concealeth the matter.
c75548	Where no counsel <i>is,</i> the people fall:
c75549	but in the multitude of counsellors <i>there is</i> safety.
c75550	shall smart
c75551	He that is surety for a stranger
c75553	<i>for it:</i> and he that hateth suretiship
c75554	is sure.
c75555	A gracious woman retaineth honour:
c75556	and strong <i>men</i> retain riches.
c75557	The merciful man doeth good to his own soul:
c75558	but <i>he that is</i> cruel troubleth his own flesh.
c75559	The wicked worketh a deceitful work:
c75561	but to him that soweth righteousness
c75562	<i>shall be</i> a sure reward.
c75563	As righteousness <i>tendeth</i> to life:
c75565	so he that pursueth evil
c75566	<i>pursueth it</i> to his own death.
c75567	They that are of a froward heart <i>are</i> abomination to the LORD:
c75568	but <i>such as are</i> upright in <i>their</i> way <i>are</i> his delight.
c75569	<i>Though</i> hand <i>join</i> in hand, the wicked shall not be unpunished:
c75570	but the seed of the righteous shall be delivered.
c75571	<i>As</i> a jewel of gold in a swine's snout, <i>so is</i> a fair woman which is without discretion.
c75572	The desire of the righteous <i>is</i> only good:
c75573	<i>but</i> the expectation of the wicked <i>is</i> wrath.
c75574	There is that scattereth,
c75575	and yet increaseth;
c75576	and <i>there is</i> that withholdeth more than is meet,
c75577	but <i>it tendeth</i> to poverty.
c75578	The liberal soul shall be made fat:
c75579	and he that watereth
c75580	shall be watered also himself.
c75581	He that withholdeth corn,
c75582	the people shall curse
c75583	him: but blessing <i>shall be</i> upon the head of him that selleth <i>it.</i>
c75584	He that diligently seeketh good
c75585	procureth favour:
c75586	but he that seeketh mischief,
c75587	it shall come unto him.
c75589	He that trusteth in his riches shall fall:
c75590	but the righteous shall flourish as a branch.
c75591	He that troubleth his own house
c75592	shall inherit the wind:
c75593	and the fool <i>shall be</i> servant to the wise of heart.
c75594	The fruit of the righteous <i>is</i> a tree of life;
c75595	and he that winneth souls <i>is</i> wise.
c75596	Behold, the righteous shall be recompensed in the earth:
c75597	much more the wicked and the sinner.
c75598	Whoso loveth instruction
c75599	loveth knowledge:
c75601	but he that hateth reproof
c75602	<i>is</i> brutish.
c75603	A good <i>man</i> obtaineth favour of the LORD:
c75604	but a man of wicked devices will he condemn.
c75605	A man shall not be established by wickedness:
c75606	but the root of the righteous shall not be moved.
c75607	A virtuous woman <i>is</i> a crown to her husband:
c75608	but she that maketh ashamed <i>is</i> as rottenness in his bones.
c75609	The thoughts of the righteous <i>are</i> right:
c75610	<i>but</i> the counsels of the wicked <i>are</i> deceit.
c75611	The words of the wicked
c75612	<i>are</i> to lie in wait for blood:
c75613	but the mouth of the upright shall deliver them.
c75614	The wicked are overthrown,
c75615	and <i>are</i> not:
c75616	but the house of the righteous shall stand.
c75617	A man shall be commended according to his wisdom:
c75618	but he that is of a perverse heart shall be despised.
c75619	<i>He that is</i> despised, and hath a servant, <i>is</i> better
c75621	than he that honoureth himself,
c75622	and lacketh bread.
c75623	A righteous <i>man</i> regardeth the life of his beast:
c75624	but the tender mercies of the wicked <i>are</i> cruel.
c75625	He that tilleth his land
c75626	shall be satisfied with bread:
c75628	but he that followeth vain
c75629	<i>persons is</i> void of understanding.
c75630	The wicked desireth the net of evil
c75631	<i>men:</i> but the root of the righteous yieldeth <i>fruit.</i>
c75632	The wicked is snared by the transgression of <i>his</i> lips:
c75633	but the just shall come out of trouble.
c75634	A man shall be satisfied with good by the fruit of <i>his</i> mouth:
c75635	and the recompence of a man's hands shall be rendered unto him.
c75636	The way of a fool <i>is</i> right in his own eyes:
c75638	but he that hearkeneth unto counsel
c75639	<i>is</i> wise.
c75640	A fool's
c75641	wrath is presently known:
c75643	<i>man</i> covereth shame.
c75644	but a prudent
c75645	<i>He that</i> speaketh truth
c75646	sheweth forth righteousness:
c75647	but a false witness deceit.
c75648	There is
c75649	that speaketh like the piercings of a sword:
c75650	but the tongue of the wise <i>is</i> health.
c75651	The lip of truth shall be established for ever:
c75653	but a lying tongue <i>is</i> but for a moment.
c75655	Deceit <i>is</i> in the heart of them that imagine evil:
c75656	but to the counsellors of peace <i>is</i> joy.
c75657	There shall no evil happen to the just:
c75658	but the wicked shall be filled with mischief.
c75659	Lying lips <i>are</i> abomination to the LORD:
c75660	but they that deal truly <i>are</i> his delight.
c75661	A prudent man concealeth knowledge:
c75662	but the heart of fools proclaimeth foolishness.
c75663	The hand of the diligent shall bear rule:
c75664	but the slothful shall be under tribute.
c75665	Heaviness in the heart of man
c75666	maketh it stoop:
c75667	but a good word maketh it glad.
c75668	The righteous <i>is</i> more excellent than his neighbour:
c75669	but the way of the wicked seduceth them.
c75670	The slothful <i>man</i> roasteth not that which he took in hunting:
c75671	but the substance of a diligent man <i>is</i> precious.
c75672	In the way of righteousness <i>is</i> life;
c75673	and <i>in</i> the pathway <i>thereof there is</i> no death.
c75674	A wise son <i>heareth</i> his father's instruction:
c75675	but a scorner heareth not rebuke.
c75676	A man shall eat good by the fruit of <i>his</i> mouth:
c75677	but the soul of the transgressors <i>shall eat</i> violence.
c75678	He that keepeth his mouth
c75679	keepeth his life:
c75680	<i>but</i> he that openeth wide his lips
c75681	shall have destruction.
c75682	desireth,
c75683	and <i>hath</i> nothing:
c75684	The soul of the sluggard
c75685	but the soul of the diligent shall be made fat.
c75686	A righteous <i>man</i> hateth lying:
c75687	but a wicked <i>man</i> is loathsome,
c75688	and cometh to shame.
c75689	Righteousness keepeth <i>him that is</i> upright in the way:
c75690	but wickedness overthroweth the sinner.
c75691	There is that maketh himself rich,
c75692	yet <i>hath</i> nothing:
c75693	<i>there is</i> that maketh himself poor,
c75694	yet <i>hath</i> great riches.
c75695	The ransom of a man's life <i>are</i> his riches:
c75696	but the poor heareth not rebuke.
c75697	The light of the righteous rejoiceth:
c75698	but the lamp of the wicked shall be put out.
c75699	Only by pride cometh contention:
c75700	but with the well advised <i>is</i> wisdom.
c75701	Wealth <i>gotten</i> by vanity shall be diminished:
c75703	but he that gathereth by labour
c75704	shall increase.
c75705	Hope deferred maketh the heart sick:
c75706	but <i>when</i> the desire cometh, <i>it is</i> a tree of life.
c75708	Whoso despiseth the word
c75709	shall be destroyed:
c75711	but he that feareth the commandment shall be rewarded.
c75712	The law of the wise <i>is</i> a fountain of life,
c75713	to depart from the snares of death.
c75714	Good understanding giveth favour:
c75715	but the way of transgressors <i>is</i> hard.
c75716	Every prudent <i>man</i> dealeth with knowledge:
c75717	but a fool layeth open <i>his</i> folly.
c75718	A wicked messenger falleth into mischief:
c75719	but a faithful ambassador <i>is</i> health.
c75720	Poverty and shame
c75721	<i>shall be to</i> him that refuseth instruction:
c75723	but he that regardeth reproof
c75724	shall be honoured.
c75725	The desire
c75726	accomplished
c75727	is sweet to the soul:
c75728	but <i>it is</i> abomination to fools
c75729	to depart from evil.
c75730	He that walketh with wise
c75731	<i>men</i> shall be wise:
c75733	but a companion of fools
c75734	shall be destroyed.
c75735	Evil pursueth sinners:
c75736	but to the righteous good shall be repayed.
c75737	A good <i>man</i> leaveth an inheritance to his children's children:
c75738	and the wealth of the sinner <i>is</i> laid up for the just.
c75739	Much food <i>is in</i> the tillage of the poor:
c75740	but there is <i>that is</i> destroyed for want of judgment.
c75741	He that spareth his rod
c75742	hateth his son:
c75744	but he that loveth
c75745	him chasteneth him betimes.
c75746	The righteous eateth to the satisfying of his soul:
c75747	but the belly of the wicked shall want.
c75748	Every wise woman buildeth her house:
c75749	but the foolish plucketh it down with her hands.
c75750	He that walketh in his uprightness
c75751	feareth the LORD:
c75752	but <i>he that is</i> perverse in his ways despiseth him.
c75753	In the mouth of the foolish <i>is</i> a rod of pride:
c75754	but the lips of the wise shall preserve them.
c75755	Where no oxen <i>are,</i> the crib <i>is</i> clean:
c75756	but much increase <i>is</i> by the strength of the ox.
c75757	A faithful witness will not lie:
c75758	but a false witness will utter lies.
c75759	A scorner seeketh wisdom,
c75760	and <i>findeth it</i> not:
c75761	but knowledge <i>is</i> easy unto him that understandeth.
c75762	Go from the presence of a foolish man,
c75763	when thou perceivest not <i>in him</i> the lips of knowledge.
c75764	The wisdom of the prudent
c75765	<i>is</i> to understand his way:
c75766	but the folly of fools <i>is</i> deceit.
c75767	Fools make a mock at sin:
c75768	but among the righteous <i>there is</i> favour.
c75769	The heart knoweth his own bitterness;
c75770	and a stranger doth not intermeddle with his joy.
c75771	The house of the wicked shall be overthrown:
c75772	but the tabernacle of the upright shall flourish.
c75773	There is a way which seemeth right unto a man,
c75774	but the end thereof <i>are</i> the ways of death.
c75775	Even in laughter the heart is sorrowful;
c75776	and the end of that mirth <i>is</i> heaviness.
c75777	The backslider in heart shall be filled with his own ways:
c75778	and a good man <i>shall be satisfied</i> from himself.
c75779	The simple believeth every word:
c75780	but the prudent <i>man</i> looketh well to his going.
c75781	A wise <i>man</i> feareth,
c75782	and departeth from evil:
c75783	but the fool rageth,
c75784	and is confident.
c75785	<i>He that is</i> soon angry dealeth foolishly:
c75786	and a man of wicked devices is hated.
c75787	The simple inherit folly:
c75788	but the prudent are crowned with knowledge.
c75789	The evil bow before the good;
c75790	and the wicked at the gates of the righteous.
c75791	The poor is hated even of his own neighbour:
c75792	but the rich <i>hath</i> many friends.
c75793	He that despiseth his neighbour
c75794	sinneth:
c75796	but he that hath mercy on the poor,
c75797	happy <i>is</i> he.
c75798	Do they not err that devise evil?
c75799	but mercy and truth <i>shall be</i> to them that devise good.
c75800	In all labour there is profit:
c75801	but the talk of the lips <i>tendeth</i> only to penury.
c75802	The crown of the wise <i>is</i> their riches:
c75803	<i>but</i> the foolishness of fools <i>is</i> folly.
c75804	A true witness delivereth souls:
c75805	but a deceitful <i>witness</i> speaketh lies.
c75806	In the fear of the LORD <i>is</i> strong confidence:
c75807	and his children shall have a place of refuge.
c75808	The fear of the LORD <i>is</i> a fountain of life,
c75809	to depart from the snares of death.
c75810	In the multitude of people <i>is</i> the king's honour:
c75811	but in the want of people <i>is</i> the destruction of the prince.
c75812	<i>He that is</i> slow to wrath <i>is</i> of great understanding:
c75813	but <i>he that is</i> hasty of spirit exalteth folly.
c75814	A sound heart <i>is</i> the life of the flesh:
c75815	but envy the rottenness of the bones.
c75816	He that oppresseth the poor
c75817	reproacheth his Maker:
c75818	but he that honoureth him hath mercy on the poor.
c75819	The wicked is driven away in his wickedness:
c75820	but the righteous hath hope in his death.
c75821	Wisdom resteth in the heart of him that hath understanding:
c75822	but <i>that which is</i> in the midst of fools is made known.
c75823	Righteousness exalteth a nation:
c75824	but sin <i>is</i> a reproach to any people.
c75825	The king's favour <i>is</i> toward a wise servant:
c75826	but his wrath is
c75827	<i>against</i> him that causeth shame.
c75828	A soft answer turneth away wrath:
c75829	but grievous words stir up anger.
c75830	The tongue of the wise useth knowledge aright:
c75831	but the mouth of fools poureth out foolishness.
c75832	The eyes of the LORD <i>are</i> in every place,
c75833	beholding the evil and the good.
c75834	A wholesome tongue <i>is</i> a tree of life:
c75835	but perverseness therein <i>is</i> a breach in the spirit.
c75836	A fool despiseth his father's instruction:
c75838	but he that regardeth reproof
c75839	is prudent.
c75840	In the house of the righteous <i>is</i> much treasure:
c75841	but in the revenues of the wicked is trouble.
c75842	The lips of the wise disperse knowledge:
c75843	but the heart of the foolish <i>doeth</i> not so.
c75844	The sacrifice of the wicked <i>is</i> an abomination to the LORD:
c75845	but the prayer of the upright <i>is</i> his delight.
c75846	The way of the wicked <i>is</i> an abomination unto the LORD:
c75848	him that followeth after righteousness.
c75849	but he loveth
c75850	Correction <i>is</i> grievous unto him that forsaketh the way:
c75851	<i>and</i> he that hateth reproof
c75852	shall die.
c75853	Hell and destruction <i>are</i> before the LORD:
c75854	how much more then the hearts of the children of men?
c75855	A scorner loveth not
c75856	one that reproveth
c75857	him: neither will he go unto the wise.
c75858	A merry heart maketh a cheerful countenance:
c75859	but by sorrow of the heart the spirit is broken.
c75860	The heart of him that hath understanding seeketh knowledge:
c75861	but the mouth of fools feedeth on foolishness.
c75862	All the days of the afflicted <i>are</i> evil:
c75863	but he that is of a merry heart <i>hath</i> a continual feast.
c75864	Better <i>is</i> little with the fear of the LORD than great treasure
c75865	and trouble therewith.
c75866	Better <i>is</i> a dinner of herbs
c75867	where love
c75868	is, than a stalled ox
c75869	and hatred therewith.
c75870	A wrathful man stirreth up strife:
c75871	but <i>he that is</i> slow to anger appeaseth strife.
c75872	The way of the slothful <i>man is</i> as an hedge of thorns:
c75873	but the way of the righteous <i>is</i> made plain.
c75874	A wise son maketh a glad father:
c75875	but a foolish man despiseth his mother.
c75876	Folly <i>is</i> joy to <i>him that is</i> destitute of wisdom:
c75877	but a man of understanding walketh uprightly.
c75879	Without counsel purposes are disappointed:
c75880	but in the multitude of counsellors they are established.
c75881	A man hath joy by the answer of his mouth:
c75882	and a word <i>spoken</i> in due season,
c75883	how good <i>is it!</i>
c75884	The way of life <i>is</i> above to the wise,
c75885	that he may depart from hell beneath.
c75886	The LORD will destroy the house of the proud:
c75887	but he will establish the border of the widow.
c75888	The thoughts of the wicked <i>are</i> an abomination to the LORD:
c75889	but <i>the words</i> of the pure <i>are</i> pleasant words.
c75890	troubleth his own house;
c75891	He that is greedy of gain
c75893	but he that hateth gifts
c75894	shall live.
c75895	The heart of the righteous studieth
c75896	to answer:
c75897	but the mouth of the wicked poureth out evil things.
c75898	The LORD <i>is</i> far from the wicked:
c75899	but he heareth the prayer of the righteous.
c75900	The light of the eyes rejoiceth the heart:
c75901	<i>and</i> a good report maketh the bones fat.
c75902	The ear
c75903	that heareth the reproof of life
c75904	abideth among the wise.
c75905	He that refuseth instruction
c75906	despiseth his own soul:
c75908	but he that heareth reproof
c75909	getteth understanding.
c75910	The fear of the LORD <i>is</i> the instruction of wisdom;
c75911	and before honour <i>is</i> humility.
c75912	The preparations of the heart in man,
c75913	and the answer of the tongue, <i>is</i> from the LORD.
c75914	All the ways of a man <i>are</i> clean in his own eyes;
c75915	but the LORD weigheth the spirits.
c75916	Commit thy works unto the LORD,
c75917	and thy thoughts shall be established.
c75918	The LORD hath made all <i>things</i> for himself:
c75919	yea, even the wicked for the day of evil.
c75920	Every one <i>that is</i> proud in heart <i>is</i> an abomination to the LORD:
c75921	<i>though</i> hand <i>join</i> in hand,
c75922	he shall not be unpunished.
c75923	By mercy and truth iniquity is purged:
c75924	and by the fear of the LORD <i>men</i> depart from evil.
c75925	When a man's ways please the LORD,
c75926	he maketh even his enemies to be at peace with him.
c75927	Better <i>is</i> a little with righteousness than great revenues
c75928	without right.
c75929	A man's heart deviseth his way:
c75930	but the LORD directeth his steps.
c75931	A divine sentence <i>is</i> in the lips of the king:
c75932	his mouth transgresseth not in judgment.
c75933	A just weight and balance <i>are</i> the LORD'S:
c75934	all the weights of the bag <i>are</i> his work.
c75935	<i>It is</i> an abomination to kings
c75936	to commit wickedness:
c75937	for the throne is established by righteousness.
c75938	Righteous lips <i>are</i> the delight of kings;
c75940	him that speaketh right.
c75941	and they love
c75942	The wrath of a king <i>is as</i> messengers of death:
c75943	but a wise man will pacify it.
c75944	In the light of the king's countenance <i>is</i> life;
c75945	and his favour <i>is</i> as a cloud of the latter rain.
c75947	How much better <i>is it</i> to get wisdom than gold!
c75949	and to get understanding
c75950	rather to be chosen than silver!
c75951	The highway of the upright
c75952	<i>is</i> to depart from evil:
c75953	preserveth his soul.
c75954	he that keepeth his way
c75955	Pride <i>goeth</i> before destruction,
c75956	and an haughty spirit before a fall.
c75957	Better
c75958	<i>it is to be</i> of an humble spirit with the lowly,
c75959	than to divide the spoil with the proud.
c75960	He that handleth a matter wisely
c75961	shall find good:
c75963	and whoso trusteth in the LORD,
c75964	happy <i>is</i> he.
c75965	The wise in heart shall be called prudent:
c75966	and the sweetness of the lips increaseth learning.
c75967	Understanding <i>is</i> a wellspring of life unto him that hath
c75968	it: but the instruction of fools <i>is</i> folly.
c75969	The heart of the wise teacheth his mouth,
c75970	and addeth learning to his lips.
c75971	Pleasant words <i>are as</i> an honeycomb,
c75972	sweet to the soul,
c75973	and health to the bones.
c75974	There is a way that seemeth right unto a man,
c75975	but the end thereof <i>are</i> the ways of death.
c75976	He that laboureth laboureth
c75977	for himself; for his mouth craveth it of him.
c75978	An ungodly man diggeth up evil:
c75979	and in his lips <i>there is</i> as a burning fire.
c75980	A froward man soweth strife:
c75981	and a whisperer separateth chief friends.
c75982	A violent man enticeth his neighbour,
c75983	and leadeth him into the way
c75984	<i>that is</i> not good.
c75985	He shutteth his eyes
c75986	to devise froward things:
c75987	moving his lips
c75988	he bringeth evil to pass.
c75989	The hoary head <i>is</i> a crown of glory,
c75990	<i>if</i> it be found in the way of righteousness.
c75991	<i>He that is</i> slow to anger <i>is</i> better than the mighty;
c75993	and he that ruleth his spirit
c75994	than he that taketh a city.
c75995	The lot is cast into the lap;
c75996	but the whole disposing thereof <i>is</i> of the LORD.
c75997	Better <i>is</i> a dry morsel,
c75998	and quietness
c75999	therewith, than an house
c76000	full of sacrifices <i>with</i> strife.
c76001	A wise servant shall have rule over a son
c76002	that causeth shame,
c76003	and shall have part of the inheritance among the brethren.
c76004	The fining pot <i>is</i> for silver,
c76005	and the furnace for gold:
c76006	but the LORD trieth the hearts.
c76007	A wicked doer giveth heed to false lips;
c76008	<i>and</i> a liar giveth ear to a naughty tongue.
c76009	Whoso mocketh the poor
c76010	reproacheth his Maker:
c76011	<i>and</i> he that is glad at calamities shall not be unpunished.
c76012	Children's children <i>are</i> the crown of old men;
c76013	and the glory of children <i>are</i> their fathers.
c76014	Excellent speech becometh not a fool:
c76015	much less do lying lips a prince.
c76016	A gift <i>is as</i> a precious stone in the eyes of him that hath
c76017	it: whithersoever
c76018	it turneth,
c76019	it prospereth.
c76020	He that covereth a transgression
c76021	seeketh love;
c76023	but he that repeateth a matter
c76024	separateth <i>very</i> friends.
c76025	A reproof entereth more into a wise
c76026	man than an hundred stripes into a fool.
c76027	An evil <i>man</i> seeketh only rebellion:
c76028	therefore a cruel messenger shall be sent against him.
c76029	Let a bear robbed of her whelps meet a man,
c76030	rather than a fool in his folly.
c76031	Whoso rewardeth evil for good,
c76032	evil shall not depart from his house.
c76033	The beginning of strife <i>is as</i> when one letteth out water:
c76035	before it be meddled with.
c76036	therefore leave off contention,
c76037	He that justifieth the wicked,
c76038	and he that condemneth the just,
c76039	even they both <i>are</i> abomination to the LORD.
c76040	Wherefore <i>is there</i> a price in the hand of a fool
c76041	to get wisdom,
c76042	seeing <i>he hath</i> no heart <i>to it?</i>
c76043	A friend loveth at all times,
c76044	and a brother is born for adversity.
c76045	A man void of understanding striketh hands,
c76046	<i>and</i> becometh surety in the presence of his friend.
c76047	He loveth transgression
c76048	that loveth strife:
c76049	<i>and</i> he that exalteth his gate
c76050	seeketh destruction.
c76051	He that hath a froward heart findeth no good:
c76053	and he that hath a perverse tongue
c76054	falleth into mischief.
c76055	He that begetteth a fool
c76056	<i>doeth it</i> to his sorrow:
c76057	and the father of a fool hath no joy.
c76058	A merry heart doeth good <i>like</i> a medicine:
c76059	but a broken spirit drieth the bones.
c76060	A wicked <i>man</i> taketh a gift out of the bosom
c76061	to pervert the ways of judgment.
c76062	Wisdom <i>is</i> before him that hath understanding;
c76063	but the eyes of a fool <i>are</i> in the ends of the earth.
c76064	A foolish son <i>is</i> a grief to his father,
c76065	and bitterness to her that bare him.
c76066	Also to punish the just
c76067	<i>is</i> not good,
c76068	<i>nor</i> to strike princes for equity.
c76069	spareth his words:
c76070	He that hath knowledge
c76071	<i>and</i> a man of understanding is of an excellent spirit.
c76072	Even a fool,
c76073	when he holdeth his peace,
c76074	is counted wise:
c76075	<i>and</i> he that shutteth his lips
c76076	<i>is esteemed</i> a man of understanding.
c76077	Through desire a man, having separated himself, seeketh
c76078	<i>and</i> intermeddleth with all wisdom.
c76079	A fool hath no delight in understanding,
c76080	but
c76081	that his heart may discover itself.
c76082	When the wicked cometh,
c76083	<i>then</i> cometh also contempt,
c76084	and with ignominy reproach.
c76085	The words of a man's mouth <i>are as</i> deep waters,
c76086	<i>and</i> the wellspring of wisdom <i>as</i> a flowing brook.
c76087	to accept the person of the wicked,
c76088	<i>It is</i> not good
c76089	to overthrow the righteous in judgment.
c76090	A fool's lips enter into contention,
c76091	and his mouth calleth for strokes.
c76092	A fool's mouth <i>is</i> his destruction,
c76093	and his lips <i>are</i> the snare of his soul.
c76094	The words of a talebearer <i>are</i> as wounds,
c76095	and they go down into the innermost parts of the belly.
c76097	He also that is slothful in his work is brother to him that is a great waster.
c76098	The name of the LORD <i>is</i> a strong tower:
c76099	the righteous runneth
c76100	into it, and is safe.
c76101	The rich man's wealth <i>is</i> his strong city,
c76102	and as an high wall in his own conceit.
c76103	Before destruction the heart of man is haughty,
c76104	and before honour <i>is</i> humility.
c76105	He that answereth a matter
c76106	before he heareth
c76107	<i>it,</i> it <i>is</i> folly
c76108	and shame unto him.
c76109	The spirit of a man will sustain his infirmity;
c76110	but a wounded spirit
c76111	who can bear?
c76112	The heart of the prudent getteth knowledge;
c76113	and the ear of the wise seeketh knowledge.
c76114	A man's gift maketh room
c76115	for him, and bringeth him before great men.
c76116	<i>He that is</i> first in his own cause <i>seemeth</i> just;
c76117	but his neighbour cometh
c76118	and searcheth him.
c76119	The lot causeth contentions to cease,
c76120	and parteth between the mighty.
c76121	A brother offended <i>is harder to be won</i> than a strong city:
c76122	and <i>their</i> contentions <i>are</i> like the bars of a castle.
c76123	A man's belly shall be satisfied with the fruit of his mouth;
c76124	<i>and</i> with the increase of his lips shall he be filled.
c76125	Death and life <i>are</i> in the power of the tongue:
c76126	and they that love it shall eat the fruit thereof.
c76127	<i>Whoso</i> findeth a wife
c76128	findeth a good
c76129	<i>thing,</i> and obtaineth favour of the LORD.
c76130	The poor useth intreaties;
c76131	but the rich answereth roughly.
c76132	A man <i>that hath</i> friends
c76133	must shew himself friendly:
c76134	and there is a friend
c76135	<i>that</i> sticketh closer than a brother.
c76136	Better <i>is</i> the poor
c76137	that walketh in his integrity,
c76138	than <i>he that is</i> perverse in his lips,
c76139	and is a fool.
c76140	Also, <i>that</i> the soul <i>be</i> without knowledge, <i>it is</i> not good;
c76142	and he that hasteth with <i>his</i> feet
c76143	sinneth.
c76144	The foolishness of man perverteth his way:
c76145	and his heart fretteth against the LORD.
c76146	Wealth maketh many friends;
c76147	but the poor is separated from his neighbour.
c76148	A false witness shall not be unpunished,
c76149	and <i>he that</i> speaketh lies
c76150	shall not escape.
c76151	Many will intreat the favour of the prince:
c76152	and every man <i>is</i> a friend to him that giveth gifts.
c76153	All the brethren of the poor do hate
c76154	him: how much more do his friends go far from
c76155	him? he pursueth <i>them with</i> words,
c76156	<i>yet</i> they <i>are</i> wanting <i>to him.</i>
c76157	He that getteth wisdom
c76158	loveth his own soul:
c76159	he that keepeth understanding
c76160	shall find good.
c76161	A false witness shall not be unpunished,
c76162	and <i>he that</i> speaketh lies
c76163	shall perish.
c76164	Delight is not seemly for a fool;
c76165	much less for a servant
c76166	to have rule over princes.
c76167	The discretion of a man deferreth his anger;
c76168	and <i>it is</i> his glory
c76169	to pass over a transgression.
c76170	The king's wrath <i>is</i> as the roaring of a lion;
c76171	but his favour <i>is</i> as dew upon the grass.
c76172	A foolish son <i>is</i> the calamity of his father:
c76173	and the contentions of a wife <i>are</i> a continual dropping.
c76174	House and riches <i>are</i> the inheritance of fathers:
c76175	wife <i>is</i> from the LORD.
c76176	and a prudent
c76177	Slothfulness casteth into a deep sleep;
c76178	and an idle soul shall suffer hunger.
c76179	He that keepeth the commandment keepeth his own soul;
c76180	<i>but</i> he that despiseth his ways shall die.
c76181	He that hath pity upon the poor lendeth unto the LORD;
c76182	and that which he hath given will he pay him again.
c76183	Chasten thy son
c76184	while there is hope,
c76186	for his crying.
c76187	and let not thy soul spare
c76188	A man of great wrath shall suffer punishment:
c76189	for if thou deliver
c76190	<i>him,</i> yet thou must do it again.
c76191	Hear counsel,
c76192	and receive instruction,
c76193	that thou mayest be wise in thy latter end.
c76194	<i>There are</i> many devices in a man's heart;
c76195	nevertheless the counsel of the LORD,
c76196	that shall stand.
c76197	The desire of a man <i>is</i> his kindness:
c76198	and a poor man <i>is</i> better than a liar.
c76199	The fear of the LORD <i>tendeth</i> to life:
c76200	and <i>he that hath it</i> shall abide satisfied;
c76201	he shall not be visited with evil.
c76202	A slothful <i>man</i> hideth his hand in <i>his</i> bosom,
c76203	and will not so much as bring it to his mouth again.
c76204	Smite a scorner,
c76205	and the simple will beware:
c76207	and reprove one that hath understanding,
c76208	<i>and</i> he will understand knowledge.
c76209	He that wasteth <i>his</i> father, <i>and</i> chaseth away <i>his</i> mother,
c76210	<i>is</i> a son
c76211	that causeth shame,
c76212	and bringeth reproach.
c76213	Cease,
c76214	my son,
c76215	to hear the instruction
c76216	<i>that causeth</i> to err from the words of knowledge.
c76217	An ungodly witness scorneth judgment:
c76218	and the mouth of the wicked devoureth iniquity.
c76219	Judgments are prepared for scorners,
c76220	and stripes for the back of fools.
c76221	Wine <i>is</i> a mocker,
c76222	strong drink <i>is</i> raging:
c76223	and whosoever
c76224	is deceived
c76225	thereby is not wise.
c76226	The fear of a king <i>is</i> as the roaring of a lion:
c76227	<i>whoso</i> provoketh him to anger sinneth <i>against</i> his own soul.
c76228	<i>It is</i> an honour for a man to cease from strife:
c76229	but every fool will be meddling.
c76230	The sluggard will not plow by reason of the cold;
c76231	<i>therefore</i> shall he beg in harvest,
c76232	and <i>have</i> nothing.
c76233	Counsel in the heart of man <i>is like</i> deep water;
c76234	but a man of understanding will draw it out.
c76235	Most men
c76236	will proclaim every one his own goodness:
c76238	but a faithful man
c76239	who can find?
c76240	The just <i>man</i> walketh in his integrity:
c76241	his children <i>are</i> blessed after him.
c76242	A king
c76243	that sitteth in the throne of judgment
c76244	scattereth away all evil with his eyes.
c76245	Who can say,
c76246	I have made my heart clean,
c76247	I am pure from my sin?
c76248	Divers weights, <i>and</i> divers measures,
c76249	both of them <i>are</i> alike abomination to the LORD.
c76250	Even a child is known by his doings,
c76251	whether his work <i>be</i> pure,
c76252	and whether <i>it be</i> right.
c76253	ear,
c76254	The hearing
c76255	eye,
c76256	and the seeing
c76257	the LORD hath made even both of them.
c76258	Love not sleep,
c76259	lest thou come to poverty;
c76260	open thine eyes,
c76261	<i>and</i> thou shalt be satisfied with bread.
c76262	<i>It is</i> naught, <i>it is</i> naught,
c76263	saith the buyer:
c76264	but when he is gone his way,
c76265	then he boasteth.
c76266	There is gold, and a multitude of rubies:
c76267	but the lips of knowledge <i>are</i> a precious jewel.
c76268	Take his garment
c76269	that is surety <i>for</i> a stranger:
c76270	and take a pledge of him for a strange woman.
c76271	Bread of deceit <i>is</i> sweet to a man;
c76272	but afterwards his mouth shall be filled with gravel.
c76273	<i>Every</i> purpose is established by counsel:
c76274	and with good advice make war.
c76275	He that goeth about <i>as</i> a talebearer revealeth secrets:
c76277	with him that flattereth with his lips.
c76278	therefore meddle not
c76279	Whoso curseth his father or his mother,
c76280	his lamp shall be put out in obscure darkness.
c76281	An inheritance <i>may be</i> gotten hastily at the beginning;
c76282	but the end thereof shall not be blessed.
c76283	Say not
c76284	thou, I will recompense evil;
c76285	<i>but</i> wait on the LORD,
c76286	and he shall save thee.
c76287	Divers weights <i>are</i> an abomination unto the LORD;
c76288	and a false balance <i>is</i> not good.
c76289	Man's goings <i>are</i> of the LORD;
c76291	how can a man then understand his own way?
c76292	<i>It is</i> a snare to the man
c76293	<i>who</i> devoureth <i>that which is</i> holy,
c76294	and after vows to make enquiry.
c76295	A wise king scattereth the wicked,
c76296	and bringeth the wheel over them.
c76297	The spirit of man <i>is</i> the candle of the LORD,
c76298	searching all the inward parts of the belly.
c76299	Mercy and truth preserve the king:
c76300	and his throne is upholden by mercy.
c76301	The glory of young men <i>is</i> their strength:
c76302	and the beauty of old men <i>is</i> the gray head.
c76303	The blueness of a wound cleanseth away evil:
c76304	so <i>do</i> stripes the inward parts of the belly.
c76305	The king's heart <i>is</i> in the hand of the LORD, <i>as</i> the rivers of water:
c76306	it whithersoever
c76307	he will.
c76308	he turneth
c76309	Every way of a man <i>is</i> right in his own eyes:
c76310	but the LORD pondereth the hearts.
c76311	To do justice and judgment
c76312	<i>is</i> more acceptable to the LORD than sacrifice.
c76313	An high look, and a proud heart, <i>and</i> the plowing of the wicked,
c76314	<i>is</i> sin.
c76315	The thoughts of the diligent <i>tend</i> only to plenteousness;
c76316	but of every one <i>that is</i> hasty only to want.
c76317	The getting of treasures by a lying tongue <i>is</i> a vanity tossed to and fro of them that seek death.
c76318	The robbery of the wicked shall destroy
c76319	them; because they refuse
c76320	to do judgment.
c76321	The way of man <i>is</i> froward and strange:
c76322	but <i>as for</i> the pure,
c76323	his work <i>is</i> right.
c76324	<i>It is</i> better
c76325	to dwell in a corner of the housetop,
c76326	than with a brawling woman in a wide house.
c76327	The soul of the wicked desireth evil:
c76328	his neighbour findeth no favour in his eyes.
c76329	When the scorner is punished,
c76330	the simple is made wise:
c76332	and when the wise is instructed,
c76333	he receiveth knowledge.
c76334	The righteous <i>man</i> wisely considereth the house of the wicked:
c76335	<i>but God</i> overthroweth the wicked for <i>their</i> wickedness.
c76336	Whoso stoppeth his ears at the cry of the poor,
c76337	he also shall cry himself,
c76338	but shall not be heard.
c76339	A gift in secret pacifieth anger:
c76340	and a reward in the bosom strong wrath.
c76341	<i>It is</i> joy to the just
c76342	to do judgment:
c76343	but destruction <i>shall be</i> to the workers of iniquity.
c76344	The man
c76345	that wandereth out of the way of understanding
c76346	shall remain in the congregation of the dead.
c76347	He that loveth pleasure <i>shall be</i> a poor man:
c76348	he that loveth wine and oil shall not be rich.
c76349	The wicked <i>shall be</i> a ransom for the righteous,
c76350	and the transgressor for the upright.
c76351	<i>It is</i> better
c76352	to dwell in the wilderness,
c76353	than with a contentious and an angry woman.
c76354	<i>There is</i> treasure to be desired and oil in the dwelling of the wise;
c76355	but a foolish man spendeth it up.
c76356	He that followeth after righteousness and mercy findeth life, righteousness, and honour.
c76357	A wise <i>man</i> scaleth the city of the mighty,
c76358	and casteth down the strength of the confidence thereof.
c76359	Whoso keepeth his mouth and his tongue keepeth his soul from troubles.
c76360	Proud <i>and</i> haughty
c76361	scorner <i>is</i> his name,
c76362	who dealeth in proud wrath.
c76363	The desire of the slothful killeth
c76364	him; for his hands refuse
c76365	to labour.
c76366	He coveteth greedily all the day
c76367	long: but the righteous giveth
c76368	and spareth not.
c76369	The sacrifice of the wicked <i>is</i> abomination:
c76370	how much more, <i>when</i> he bringeth it with a wicked mind?
c76371	A false witness shall perish:
c76372	but the man that heareth speaketh constantly.
c76373	A wicked man hardeneth his face:
c76374	but <i>as for</i> the upright,
c76375	he directeth his way.
c76376	<i>There is</i> no wisdom
c76377	nor understanding
c76378	nor counsel against the LORD.
c76379	The horse <i>is</i> prepared against the day of battle:
c76380	but safety <i>is</i> of the LORD.
c76381	A <i>good</i> name <i>is</i> rather to be chosen than great riches,
c76382	<i>and</i> loving favour rather than silver and gold.
c76383	The rich and poor meet together:
c76384	the LORD <i>is</i> the maker of them all.
c76385	A prudent <i>man</i> foreseeth the evil,
c76386	and hideth himself:
c76387	but the simple pass on,
c76388	and are punished.
c76389	By humility <i>and</i> the fear of the LORD <i>are</i> riches, and honour, and life.
c76390	Thorns <i>and</i> snares <i>are</i> in the way of the froward:
c76391	he that doth keep his soul shall be far from them.
c76392	Train up a child in the way he should go:
c76393	and when he is old,
c76394	he will not depart from it.
c76395	The rich ruleth over the poor,
c76396	and the borrower <i>is</i> servant to the lender.
c76397	He that soweth iniquity shall reap vanity:
c76398	and the rod of his anger shall fail.
c76400	He that hath a bountiful eye shall be blessed;
c76401	for he giveth of his bread to the poor.
c76402	Cast out the scorner,
c76403	and contention shall go out;
c76404	yea, strife and reproach shall cease.
c76405	He that loveth pureness of heart,
c76406	<i>for</i> the grace of his lips
c76407	the king <i>shall be</i> his friend.
c76408	The eyes of the LORD preserve knowledge,
c76409	and he overthroweth the words of the transgressor.
c76410	The slothful <i>man</i> saith,
c76411	<i>There is</i> a lion without,
c76412	I shall be slain in the streets.
c76413	The mouth of strange women <i>is</i> a deep pit:
c76414	he that is abhorred of the LORD shall fall therein.
c76415	Foolishness <i>is</i> bound in the heart of a child;
c76416	<i>but</i> the rod of correction shall drive it far from him.
c76417	He that oppresseth the poor
c76418	to increase
c76419	his <i>riches, and</i> he that giveth to the rich,
c76420	<i>shall</i> surely <i>come</i> to want.
c76421	Bow down thine ear,
c76422	and hear the words of the wise,
c76423	and apply thine heart unto my knowledge.
c76424	For <i>it is</i> a pleasant
c76425	thing if thou keep them within
c76426	thee; they shall withal be fitted in thy lips.
c76427	That thy trust may be in the LORD,
c76428	I have made known to thee this day, even to thee.
c76429	Have not I written to thee excellent things in counsels and knowledge,
c76430	That I might make thee know the certainty of the words of truth;
c76431	that thou mightest answer the words of truth to them that send unto thee?
c76432	Rob not the poor,
c76433	because he <i>is</i> poor:
c76434	neither oppress the afflicted in the gate:
c76435	For the LORD will plead their cause,
c76436	and spoil the soul of those that spoiled them.
c76437	Make no friendship with an angry man;
c76438	and with a furious man thou shalt not go:
c76439	Lest thou learn his ways,
c76440	and get a snare to thy soul.
c76441	Be not thou <i>one</i> of them that strike hands,
c76442	<i>or</i> of them that are sureties for debts.
c76443	If thou hast nothing
c76444	to pay,
c76445	why should he take away thy bed from under thee?
c76446	Remove not the ancient landmark,
c76447	which thy fathers have set.
c76448	Seest thou a man diligent in his business?
c76449	he shall stand before kings;
c76450	he shall not stand before mean <i>men.</i>
c76451	When thou sittest
c76452	to eat with a ruler,
c76453	consider diligently
c76454	what <i>is</i> before thee:
c76455	And put a knife to thy throat,
c76456	if thou <i>be</i> a man given to appetite.
c76457	Be not desirous of his dainties:
c76458	for they <i>are</i> deceitful meat.
c76459	Labour not
c76460	to be rich:
c76461	cease from thine own wisdom.
c76462	Wilt thou set thine eyes
c76463	upon that which is not?
c76464	for <i>riches</i> certainly make themselves wings;
c76465	they fly away as an eagle toward heaven.
c76466	Eat thou not the bread of <i>him that hath</i> an evil eye,
c76467	neither desire thou his dainty meats:
c76468	For
c76469	as he thinketh in his heart,
c76470	so <i>is</i> he:
c76471	Eat
c76472	and drink,
c76473	saith
c76474	he to thee; but his heart <i>is</i> not with thee.
c76475	The morsel <i>which</i> thou hast eaten
c76476	shalt thou vomit up,
c76477	and lose thy sweet words.
c76478	Speak not in the ears of a fool:
c76479	for he will despise the wisdom of thy words.
c76480	Remove not the old landmark;
c76481	and enter not into the fields of the fatherless:
c76482	For their redeemer <i>is</i> mighty;
c76483	he shall plead their cause with thee.
c76484	Apply thine heart unto instruction,
c76485	and thine ears to the words of knowledge.
c76486	Withhold not correction from the child:
c76487	for <i>if</i> thou beatest him with the rod,
c76488	he shall not die.
c76489	Thou shalt beat him with the rod,
c76490	and shalt deliver his soul from hell.
c76491	My son,
c76492	if thine heart be wise,
c76493	my heart shall rejoice,
c76494	even mine.
c76495	Yea, my reins shall rejoice,
c76496	when thy lips speak right things.
c76497	Let not thine heart envy sinners:
c76498	but <i>be thou</i> in the fear of the LORD all the day long.
c76499	For surely there is an end;
c76500	and thine expectation shall not be cut off.
c76501	Hear thou,
c76502	my son,
c76503	and be wise,
c76504	and guide thine heart in the way.
c76505	Be not among winebibbers;
c76506	among riotous eaters of flesh:
c76507	For the drunkard and the glutton shall come to poverty:
c76508	and drowsiness shall clothe <i>a man</i> with rags.
c76509	Hearken unto thy father
c76510	that begat
c76511	thee, and despise not
c76512	thy mother when she is old.
c76513	Buy the truth,
c76514	and sell <i>it</i> not; <i>also</i> wisdom, and instruction, and understanding.
c76515	The father of the righteous shall greatly rejoice:
c76516	and he that begetteth a wise <i>child</i> shall have joy of him.
c76517	Thy father and thy mother shall be glad,
c76518	and she that bare thee shall rejoice.
c76519	give
c76520	My son,
c76521	me thine heart,
c76522	and let thine eyes observe my ways.
c76523	For a whore <i>is</i> a deep ditch;
c76524	and a strange woman <i>is</i> a narrow pit.
c76525	She also lieth in wait as <i>for</i> a prey,
c76526	and increaseth the transgressors among men.
c76527	Who hath woe?
c76528	who hath sorrow?
c76529	who hath contentions?
c76530	who hath babbling?
c76531	who hath wounds without cause?
c76532	who hath redness of eyes?
c76533	They that tarry long at the wine;
c76534	they that go
c76535	to seek mixed wine.
c76536	Look not thou upon the wine
c76537	when it is red,
c76538	when it giveth his colour in the cup,
c76539	<i>when</i> it moveth itself aright.
c76540	At the last it biteth like a serpent,
c76541	and stingeth like an adder.
c76542	Thine eyes shall behold strange women,
c76543	and thine heart shall utter perverse things.
c76544	Yea, thou shalt be as he that lieth down in the midst of the sea,
c76545	or as he that lieth upon the top of a mast.
c76546	They have stricken
c76547	me, <i>shalt thou say, and</i> I was not sick;
c76548	they have beaten
c76549	me, <i>and</i> I felt <i>it</i> not:
c76550	when shall I awake?
c76552	I will seek it yet again.
c76553	Be not thou envious against evil men,
c76554	neither desire
c76555	to be with them.
c76556	For their heart studieth destruction,
c76557	and their lips talk of mischief.
c76558	Through wisdom is an house builded;
c76559	and by understanding it is established:
c76560	And by knowledge shall the chambers be filled with all precious and pleasant riches.
c76561	A wise man <i>is</i> strong;
c76562	yea, a man of knowledge increaseth strength.
c76563	For by wise counsel thou shalt make thy war:
c76564	and in multitude of counsellors <i>there is</i> safety.
c76565	Wisdom <i>is</i> too high for a fool:
c76566	he openeth not his mouth in the gate.
c76567	He that deviseth
c76568	to do evil
c76569	shall be called a mischievous person.
c76570	The thought of foolishness <i>is</i> sin:
c76571	and the scorner <i>is</i> an abomination to men.
c76572	<i>If</i> thou faint in the day of adversity,
c76573	thy strength <i>is</i> small.
c76574	to deliver
c76575	<i>them that are</i> drawn unto death,
c76576	and <i>those that are</i> ready to be slain;
c76577	If thou forbear
c76578	If thou sayest,
c76579	Behold, we knew it not;
c76580	doth not he that pondereth the heart
c76581	consider <i>it?</i> and he that keepeth thy soul, doth <i>not</i> he
c76583	know
c76584	<i>it?</i> and shall <i>not</i> he render to <i>every</i> man according to his works?
c76585	eat
c76586	My son,
c76587	thou honey,
c76588	because <i>it is</i> good;
c76589	and the honeycomb, <i>which is</i> sweet to thy taste:
c76590	So <i>shall</i> the knowledge of wisdom <i>be</i> unto thy soul:
c76591	when thou hast found
c76592	<i>it,</i> then there shall be a reward,
c76593	and thy expectation shall not be cut off.
c76594	Lay not wait,
c76595	O wicked
c76596	<i>man,</i> against the dwelling of the righteous;
c76597	spoil not his resting place:
c76598	For a just <i>man</i> falleth seven
c76599	times, and riseth up again:
c76600	but the wicked shall fall into mischief.
c76601	when thine enemy falleth,
c76602	Rejoice not
c76604	when he stumbleth:
c76605	and let not thine heart be glad
c76606	Lest the LORD see
c76607	<i>it,</i> and it displease
c76608	him, and he turn away his wrath from him.
c76609	Fret not thyself because of evil
c76610	<i>men,</i> neither be thou envious at the wicked;
c76611	For there shall be no reward to the evil
c76612	<i>man;</i> the candle of the wicked shall be put out.
c76613	fear thou the LORD
c76614	My son,
c76615	and the king:
c76616	<i>and</i> meddle not with them that are given to change:
c76617	For their calamity shall rise suddenly;
c76619	the ruin of them both?
c76620	and who knoweth
c76621	These <i>things</i> also <i>belong</i> to the wise.
c76622	to have respect of persons in judgment.
c76623	<i>It is</i> not good
c76624	He that saith unto the wicked,
c76625	Thou <i>art</i> righteous;
c76626	him shall the people curse,
c76627	nations shall abhor him:
c76628	But to them that rebuke <i>him</i> shall be delight,
c76629	and a good blessing shall come upon them.
c76630	<i>Every man</i> shall kiss <i>his</i> lips that giveth a right answer.
c76631	Prepare thy work without,
c76632	and make it fit for thyself in the field;
c76633	and afterwards
c76634	build thine house.
c76635	Be not a witness against thy neighbour without cause;
c76636	and deceive <i>not</i> with thy lips.
c76637	Say not,
c76638	I will do so to him as
c76639	he hath done
c76640	to me: I will render to the man according to his work.
c76641	I went by the field of the slothful,
c76642	and by the vineyard of the man void of understanding;
c76643	And, lo,
c76644	it was all grown over with thorns, <i>and</i> nettles
c76645	had covered the face
c76646	thereof, and the stone wall thereof was broken down.
c76647	Then I saw,
c76648	<i>and</i> considered <i>it</i> well:
c76649	I looked
c76650	upon <i>it, and</i> received instruction.
c76651	<i>Yet</i> a little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands
c76652	to sleep:
c76653	So shall thy poverty come <i>as</i> one that travelleth;
c76654	and thy want as an armed man.
c76655	These <i>are</i> also proverbs of Solomon,
c76656	which the men of Hezekiah king of Judah copied out.
c76657	<i>It is</i> the glory of God
c76658	to conceal a thing:
c76659	but the honour of kings
c76660	<i>is</i> to search out a matter.
c76661	The heaven for height, and the earth for depth, and the heart of kings <i>is</i> unsearchable.
c76662	Take away the dross from the silver,
c76663	and there shall come forth a vessel for the finer.
c76664	Take away the wicked <i>from</i> before the king,
c76665	and his throne shall be established in righteousness.
c76666	Put not forth thyself in the presence of the king,
c76667	and stand not in the place of great <i>men:</i>
c76668	For better
c76669	<i>it is</i> that it be said
c76670	unto thee, Come up hither;
c76671	than that thou shouldest be put lower in the presence of the prince
c76672	whom thine eyes have seen.
c76673	Go not forth
c76674	hastily to strive,
c76675	lest
c76676	<i>thou know not</i> what to do in the end
c76677	thereof, when thy neighbour hath put thee to shame.
c76678	Debate thy cause with thy neighbour
c76679	<i>himself;</i> and discover not a secret to another:
c76680	Lest he that heareth <i>it</i> put thee to shame,
c76681	and thine infamy turn not away.
c76682	A word fitly spoken <i>is like</i> apples of gold in pictures of silver.
c76684	<i>As</i> an earring of gold, and an ornament of fine gold, <i>so is</i> a wise reprover upon an obedient ear.
c76685	As the cold of snow in the time of harvest, <i>so is</i> a faithful messenger to them that send
c76686	him: for he refresheth the soul of his masters.
c76687	<i>is like</i> clouds and wind
c76688	without rain.
c76689	Whoso
c76690	boasteth himself of a false gift
c76691	By long forbearing is a prince persuaded,
c76692	and a soft tongue breaketh the bone.
c76693	Hast thou found honey?
c76694	eat so much as is sufficient
c76695	for thee, lest thou be filled
c76696	therewith, and vomit it.
c76697	Withdraw thy foot from thy neighbour's house;
c76698	lest he be weary
c76699	of thee, and <i>so</i> hate thee.
c76700	A man that beareth false witness against his neighbour <i>is</i> a maul, and a sword, and a sharp arrow.
c76702	Confidence in an unfaithful man in time of trouble <i>is like</i> a broken tooth, and a foot out of joint.
c76703	<i>As</i> he that taketh away a garment in cold weather,
c76704	<i>and as</i> vinegar upon nitre,
c76705	so <i>is</i> he that singeth songs to an heavy heart.
c76706	If thine enemy be hungry,
c76707	give him bread to eat;
c76708	and if he be thirsty,
c76709	give him water to drink:
c76710	For thou shalt heap coals of fire upon his head,
c76711	and the LORD shall reward thee.
c76712	The north wind driveth away rain:
c76713	so <i>doth</i> an angry countenance a backbiting tongue.
c76714	<i>It is</i> better
c76715	to dwell in the corner of the housetop,
c76716	than with a brawling woman and in a wide house.
c76717	<i>As</i> cold waters to a thirsty soul,
c76718	so <i>is</i> good news from a far country.
c76719	A righteous man falling down before the wicked <i>is as</i> a troubled fountain, and a corrupt spring.
c76721	to eat much honey:
c76722	<i>It is</i> not good
c76723	so <i>for men</i> to search their own glory <i>is not</i> glory.
c76724	He that <i>hath</i> no rule over his own spirit <i>is like</i> a city <i>that is</i> broken down, <i>and</i> without walls.
c76726	As snow in summer, and as rain in harvest,
c76727	so honour is not seemly for a fool.
c76728	As the bird
c76729	by wandering,
c76730	as the swallow
c76731	by flying,
c76732	so the curse causeless shall not come.
c76733	A whip for the horse,
c76734	a bridle for the ass,
c76735	and a rod for the fool's back.
c76736	Answer not a fool according to his folly,
c76737	lest thou also be like unto him.
c76738	Answer a fool according to his folly,
c76739	lest he be wise in his own conceit.
c76740	cutteth off the feet,
c76741	<i>and</i> drinketh damage.
c76742	He that sendeth a message by the hand of a fool
c76743	The legs of the lame are not equal:
c76744	so <i>is</i> a parable in the mouth of fools.
c76745	As he that bindeth a stone in a sling,
c76746	so
c76747	<i>is</i> he that giveth honour to a fool.
c76748	<i>As</i> a thorn goeth up into the hand of a drunkard,
c76749	so <i>is</i> a parable in the mouth of fools.
c76750	The great <i>God</i> that formed all
c76751	<i>things</i> both rewardeth the fool,
c76752	and rewardeth transgressors.
c76753	As a dog
c76754	returneth to his vomit,
c76755	<i>so</i> a fool
c76756	returneth to his folly.
c76757	Seest thou a man wise in his own conceit?
c76758	<i>there is</i> more hope of a fool than of him.
c76759	The slothful <i>man</i> saith,
c76760	<i>There is</i> a lion in the way;
c76761	a lion <i>is</i> in the streets.
c76762	<i>As</i> the door turneth upon his hinges,
c76763	so <i>doth</i> the slothful upon his bed.
c76764	The slothful hideth his hand in <i>his</i> bosom;
c76765	it grieveth
c76766	him to bring it again to his mouth.
c76767	The sluggard <i>is</i> wiser in his own conceit than seven men that can render a reason.
c76768	to him, <i>is like</i> one that taketh a dog by the ears.
c76769	He that passeth by,
c76770	<i>and</i> meddleth with strife
c76771	<i>belonging</i> not
c76772	As a mad
c76773	<i>man</i> who casteth firebrands, arrows, and death,
c76774	So <i>is</i> the man
c76775	<i>that</i> deceiveth his neighbour,
c76776	and saith,
c76777	Am not I in sport?
c76778	Where no wood is, <i>there</i> the fire goeth out:
c76779	so where <i>there is</i> no talebearer, the strife ceaseth.
c76780	<i>As</i> coals <i>are</i> to burning coals,
c76781	and wood to fire;
c76782	so <i>is</i> a contentious man
c76783	to kindle strife.
c76784	The words of a talebearer <i>are</i> as wounds,
c76785	and they go down into the innermost parts of the belly.
c76786	with silver dross.
c76787	<i>are like</i> a potsherd covered
c76788	Burning lips and a wicked heart
c76789	He that hateth dissembleth with his lips,
c76790	and layeth up deceit within him;
c76791	When he speaketh fair,
c76792	believe him not:
c76793	for <i>there are</i> seven abominations in his heart.
c76794	<i>Whose</i> hatred is covered by deceit,
c76795	his wickedness shall be shewed before the <i>whole</i> congregation.
c76796	Whoso diggeth a pit
c76797	shall fall
c76798	therein: and he that rolleth a stone,
c76799	it will return upon him.
c76800	A lying tongue hateth <i>those that are</i> afflicted
c76801	by it; and a flattering mouth worketh ruin.
c76802	Boast not thyself of to morrow;
c76803	for thou knowest not
c76804	what a day may bring forth.
c76805	Let another man praise
c76806	thee, and not thine own mouth;
c76807	a stranger,
c76808	and not thine own lips.
c76809	A stone <i>is</i> heavy,
c76810	and the sand weighty;
c76811	but a fool's wrath <i>is</i> heavier than them both.
c76812	Wrath <i>is</i> cruel, and anger <i>is</i> outrageous;
c76813	but who <i>is</i> able to stand before envy?
c76814	Open rebuke <i>is</i> better than secret love.
c76815	Faithful <i>are</i> the wounds of a friend;
c76816	but the kisses of an enemy <i>are</i> deceitful.
c76817	The full soul loatheth an honeycomb;
c76818	but to the hungry soul
c76819	every bitter thing is sweet.
c76820	As a bird
c76821	that wandereth from her nest,
c76822	so <i>is</i> a man
c76823	that wandereth from his place.
c76824	Ointment and perfume rejoice the heart:
c76825	so <i>doth</i> the sweetness of a man's friend by hearty counsel.
c76826	Thine own friend, and thy father's friend, forsake not;
c76827	neither go into thy brother's house in the day of thy calamity:
c76828	<i>for</i> better <i>is</i> a neighbour <i>that is</i> near than a brother far off.
c76829	be wise,
c76830	My son,
c76831	and make my heart glad,
c76832	that I may answer him that reproacheth me.
c76833	A prudent <i>man</i> foreseeth the evil,
c76834	<i>and</i> hideth himself;
c76835	<i>but</i> the simple pass on,
c76836	<i>and</i> are punished.
c76837	Take his garment
c76838	that is surety for a stranger,
c76839	and take a pledge of him for a strange woman.
c76840	He that blesseth his friend with a loud voice,
c76841	rising early in the morning,
c76842	it shall be counted a curse to him.
c76843	A continual dropping in a very rainy day and a contentious woman are alike.
c76844	Whosoever hideth her hideth the wind,
c76845	and the ointment of his right hand, <i>which</i> bewrayeth <i>itself.</i>
c76846	Iron sharpeneth iron;
c76847	so a man sharpeneth the countenance of his friend.
c76848	Whoso keepeth the fig tree shall eat the fruit
c76849	thereof: so he that waiteth on his master shall be honoured.
c76850	As in water
c76851	face <i>answereth</i> to face,
c76852	so the heart of man to man.
c76853	Hell and destruction are never full;
c76854	so the eyes of man are never satisfied.
c76855	<i>As</i> the fining pot for silver,
c76856	and the furnace for gold;
c76857	so <i>is</i> a man to his praise.
c76858	Though thou shouldest bray a fool in a mortar among wheat with a pestle,
c76859	<i>yet</i> will not his foolishness depart from him.
c76860	Be thou diligent to know the state of thy flocks,
c76861	<i>and</i> look well to thy herds.
c76862	For riches <i>are</i> not for ever:
c76863	and doth the crown <i>endure</i> to every generation?
c76864	The hay appeareth,
c76865	and the tender grass sheweth itself,
c76866	and herbs of the mountains are gathered.
c76867	The lambs <i>are</i> for thy clothing,
c76868	and the goats <i>are</i> the price of the field.
c76869	And <i>thou shalt have</i> goats' milk enough for thy food,
c76870	for the food of thy household,
c76871	and <i>for</i> the maintenance for thy maidens.
c76872	flee
c76873	when no man pursueth:
c76874	The wicked
c76875	but the righteous are bold as a lion.
c76876	For the transgression of a land many <i>are</i> the princes
c76877	thereof: but by a man of understanding <i>and</i> knowledge the state <i>thereof</i> shall be prolonged.
c76878	A poor man that oppresseth the poor <i>is like</i> a sweeping rain
c76880	which leaveth no food.
c76881	They that forsake the law praise the wicked:
c76882	but such as keep the law contend with them.
c76883	Evil men understand not judgment:
c76884	but they that seek the LORD understand all <i>things.</i>
c76885	Better <i>is</i> the poor
c76886	that walketh in his uprightness,
c76887	than <i>he that is</i> perverse <i>in his</i> ways,
c76888	though he <i>be</i> rich.
c76889	Whoso keepeth the law <i>is</i> a wise son:
c76891	but he that is a companion of riotous
c76892	<i>men</i> shameth his father.
c76893	He that by usury and unjust gain increaseth his substance,
c76894	he shall gather it for him that will pity the poor.
c76895	He that turneth away his ear
c76896	from hearing the law,
c76897	even his prayer <i>shall be</i> abomination.
c76898	Whoso causeth the righteous to go astray in an evil way,
c76899	he shall fall himself into his own pit:
c76900	but the upright shall have good <i>things</i> in possession.
c76901	The rich man <i>is</i> wise in his own conceit;
c76902	but the poor that hath understanding searcheth him out.
c76903	When righteous <i>men</i> do rejoice,
c76904	<i>there is</i> great glory:
c76906	but when the wicked rise,
c76907	a man is hidden.
c76908	He that covereth his sins
c76909	shall not prosper:
c76911	but whoso confesseth
c76912	and forsaketh
c76913	<i>them</i> shall have mercy.
c76914	Happy <i>is</i> the man
c76915	that feareth alway:
c76917	but he that hardeneth his heart
c76918	shall fall into mischief.
c76919	<i>As</i> a roaring lion, and a ranging bear; <i>so is</i> a wicked ruler over the poor people.
c76920	The prince that wanteth understanding
c76921	<i>is</i> also a great oppressor:
c76922	<i>but</i> he that hateth covetousness shall prolong <i>his</i> days.
c76923	A man
c76924	that doeth violence to the blood of <i>any</i> person
c76925	shall flee to the pit;
c76926	let no man stay him.
c76927	Whoso walketh uprightly
c76928	shall be saved:
c76929	but <i>he that is</i> perverse <i>in his</i> ways shall fall at once.
c76930	He that tilleth his land shall have plenty of bread:
c76931	but he that followeth after vain <i>persons</i> shall have poverty enough.
c76932	A faithful man shall abound with blessings:
c76934	but he that maketh haste
c76935	to be rich
c76936	shall not be innocent.
c76937	To have respect of persons
c76938	<i>is</i> not good:
c76939	for for a piece of bread <i>that</i> man will transgress.
c76940	He that hasteth to be rich <i>hath</i> an evil eye,
c76941	and considereth not
c76942	that poverty shall come upon him.
c76943	He that rebuketh a man afterwards shall find more favour than he that flattereth with the tongue.
c76944	Whoso robbeth his father or his mother,
c76945	and saith,
c76946	<i>It is</i> no transgression;
c76947	the same <i>is</i> the companion of a destroyer.
c76948	He that is of a proud heart stirreth up strife:
c76950	but he that putteth his trust in the LORD
c76951	shall be made fat.
c76953	He that trusteth in his own heart is a fool:
c76954	but whoso walketh wisely,
c76955	he shall be delivered.
c76956	He that giveth unto the poor
c76957	shall not lack:
c76958	but he that hideth his eyes shall have many a curse.
c76959	When the wicked rise,
c76960	men hide themselves:
c76962	but when they perish,
c76963	the righteous increase.
c76964	He, that being often reproved
c76965	hardeneth <i>his</i> neck,
c76966	shall suddenly be destroyed,
c76967	and that without remedy.
c76968	When the righteous are in authority,
c76969	the people rejoice:
c76971	but when the wicked beareth rule,
c76972	the people mourn.
c76973	Whoso
c76974	loveth wisdom
c76975	rejoiceth his father:
c76977	but he that keepeth company with harlots
c76978	spendeth <i>his</i> substance.
c76979	The king by judgment establisheth the land:
c76980	but he that receiveth gifts overthroweth it.
c76981	A man
c76982	that flattereth his neighbour
c76983	spreadeth a net for his feet.
c76984	In the transgression of an evil man <i>there is</i> a snare:
c76985	but the righteous doth sing
c76986	and rejoice.
c76987	The righteous considereth the cause of the poor:
c76988	<i>but</i> the wicked regardeth not to know <i>it.</i>
c76989	Scornful men bring a city into a snare:
c76990	but wise <i>men</i> turn away wrath.
c76991	<i>If</i> a wise man contendeth with a foolish man,
c76992	whether he rage
c76993	or laugh,
c76994	<i>there is</i> no rest.
c76995	The bloodthirsty hate the upright:
c76996	but the just seek his soul.
c76997	A fool uttereth all his mind:
c76998	but a wise <i>man</i> keepeth it in till afterwards.
c76999	If a ruler
c77000	hearken to lies,
c77001	all his servants <i>are</i> wicked.
c77002	The poor and the deceitful man meet together:
c77003	the LORD lighteneth both their eyes.
c77004	The king
c77005	that faithfully judgeth the poor,
c77006	his throne shall be established for ever.
c77007	The rod and reproof give wisdom:
c77008	but a child left <i>to himself</i> bringeth his mother to shame.
c77009	When the wicked are multiplied,
c77010	transgression increaseth:
c77011	but the righteous shall see their fall.
c77012	Correct thy son,
c77013	and he shall give thee rest;
c77014	yea, he shall give delight unto thy soul.
c77015	Where <i>there is</i> no vision, the people perish:
c77016	but he that keepeth the law,
c77017	happy <i>is</i> he.
c77018	A servant will not be corrected by words:
c77019	for though he understand
c77020	he will not answer.
c77021	Seest thou a man
c77022	<i>that is</i> hasty in his words?
c77023	<i>there is</i> more hope of a fool than of him.
c77024	He that delicately bringeth up his servant from a child
c77025	shall have him become <i>his</i> son at the length.
c77026	An angry man stirreth up strife,
c77027	and a furious man aboundeth in transgression.
c77028	A man's pride shall bring him low:
c77029	but honour shall uphold the humble in spirit.
c77030	Whoso is partner with a thief
c77031	hateth his own soul:
c77032	he heareth cursing,
c77033	and bewrayeth <i>it</i> not.
c77034	The fear of man bringeth a snare:
c77036	but whoso putteth his trust in the LORD
c77037	shall be safe.
c77038	Many seek the ruler's favour;
c77039	but <i>every</i> man's judgment <i>cometh</i> from the LORD.
c77040	An unjust man <i>is</i> an abomination to the just:
c77041	and <i>he that is</i> upright in the way <i>is</i> abomination to the wicked.
c77042	The words of Agur the son of Jakeh,
c77043	<i>even</i> the prophecy:
c77044	the man spake unto Ithiel, even unto Ithiel and Ucal,
c77045	Surely I <i>am</i> more brutish than <i>any</i> man,
c77046	and have not the understanding of a man.
c77047	I neither learned wisdom,
c77048	nor have the knowledge of the holy.
c77049	Who hath ascended up into heaven,
c77050	or descended?
c77051	who hath gathered the wind in his fists?
c77052	who hath bound the waters in a garment?
c77053	who hath established all the ends of the earth?
c77054	what <i>is</i> his name,
c77055	and what <i>is</i> his son's name,
c77056	if thou canst tell?
c77057	Every word of God <i>is</i> pure:
c77058	he <i>is</i> a shield
c77059	unto them that put their trust in him.
c77060	Add thou not unto his words,
c77061	lest he reprove
c77062	thee, and thou be found a liar.
c77063	Two <i>things</i> have I required of
c77064	thee; deny me <i>them</i> not
c77065	before I die:
c77066	Remove far from me vanity and lies:
c77067	give me neither poverty nor riches;
c77068	feed me with food convenient for me:
c77069	Lest I be full,
c77070	and deny
c77071	<i>thee,</i> and say,
c77072	Who <i>is</i> the LORD?
c77073	or lest I be poor,
c77074	and steal,
c77075	and take the name of my God <i>in vain.</i>
c77076	Accuse not a servant unto his master,
c77077	lest he curse
c77078	thee, and thou be found guilty.
c77079	<i>There is</i> a generation <i>that</i> curseth their father,
c77080	and doth not bless their mother.
c77081	<i>There is</i> a generation <i>that are</i> pure in their own eyes,
c77082	and <i>yet</i> is not washed from their filthiness.
c77083	<i>There is</i> a generation,
c77084	O how lofty are their eyes!
c77085	and their eyelids are lifted up.
c77086	<i>There is</i> a generation,
c77087	whose teeth <i>are as</i> swords,
c77088	and their jaw teeth <i>as</i> knives,
c77089	to devour the poor from off the earth, and the needy from <i>among</i> men.
c77090	The horseleach hath two daughters,
c77091	<i>crying,</i> Give,
c77092	give.
c77093	There are three <i>things that</i> are never satisfied,
c77094	<i>yea,</i> four <i>things</i> say not,
c77095	<i>It is</i> enough:
c77096	The grave;
c77097	and the barren womb;
c77098	the earth
c77099	<i>that</i> is not filled with water;
c77100	and the fire
c77101	<i>that</i> saith not,
c77102	<i>It is</i> enough.
c77103	The eye
c77104	<i>that</i> mocketh at <i>his</i> father,
c77105	and despiseth to obey <i>his</i> mother,
c77106	the ravens of the valley shall pick it out,
c77107	and the young eagles shall eat it.
c77108	There be three <i>things which</i> are too wonderful for
c77109	me, yea, four
c77110	which I know not:
c77111	The way of an eagle in the air;
c77112	the way of a serpent upon a rock;
c77113	the way of a ship in the midst of the sea;
c77114	and the way of a man with a maid.
c77115	Such <i>is</i> the way of an adulterous woman;
c77116	she eateth,
c77117	and wipeth her mouth,
c77118	and saith,
c77119	I have done no wickedness.
c77120	For three <i>things</i> the earth is disquieted,
c77121	and for four
c77122	<i>which</i> it cannot
c77123	bear:
c77124	For a servant
c77125	when he reigneth;
c77126	and a fool
c77127	when he is filled with meat;
c77128	For an odious
c77129	<i>woman</i> when she is married;
c77130	and an handmaid
c77131	that is heir to her mistress.
c77132	There be four <i>things which are</i> little upon the earth, but they
c77133	<i>are</i> exceeding wise:
c77134	The ants <i>are</i> a people
c77135	not strong,
c77136	yet they prepare their meat in the summer;
c77137	The conies <i>are but</i> a feeble folk,
c77139	yet make they their houses in the rocks;
c77140	The locusts have no king,
c77141	yet go they forth
c77142	all of them by bands;
c77143	The spider taketh hold with her hands,
c77144	and is in kings' palaces.
c77145	There be three <i>things</i> which go well,
c77146	yea, four are comely
c77147	in going:
c77148	A lion
c77149	<i>which is</i> strongest among beasts,
c77150	and turneth not away for any;
c77151	A greyhound;
c77152	an he goat also;
c77153	and a king,
c77154	against whom <i>there is</i> no rising up.
c77155	If thou hast done foolishly
c77156	in lifting up thyself,
c77157	or if thou hast thought evil,
c77158	<i>lay</i> thine hand upon thy mouth.
c77159	Surely the churning of milk bringeth forth butter,
c77160	and the wringing of the nose bringeth forth blood:
c77161	so the forcing of wrath bringeth forth strife.
c77162	The words of king Lemuel,
c77163	the prophecy
c77164	that his mother taught him.
c77165	What,
c77166	my son?
c77167	and what,
c77168	the son of my womb?
c77169	and what,
c77170	the son of my vows?
c77171	Give not thy strength unto women,
c77172	nor thy ways
c77173	to that which destroyeth kings.
c77174	<i>It is</i> not for kings,
c77175	O Lemuel,
c77176	<i>it is</i> not for kings
c77177	to drink wine;
c77179	nor for princes strong drink:
c77180	Lest they drink,
c77181	and forget the law,
c77182	and pervert the judgment of any of the afflicted.
c77183	Give strong drink unto him that is ready to perish,
c77184	and wine unto those that be of heavy hearts.
c77185	Let him drink,
c77186	and forget his poverty,
c77187	and remember his misery no more.
c77188	Open thy mouth for the dumb in the cause of all such as are appointed to destruction.
c77189	Open thy mouth,
c77190	judge righteously,
c77191	and plead the cause of the poor and needy.
c77192	a virtuous woman?
c77193	Who can find
c77194	for her price <i>is</i> far above rubies.
c77195	The heart of her husband doth safely trust
c77196	in her, so that he shall have no need of spoil.
c77197	She will do him good
c77198	and not evil
c77199	all the days of her life.
c77200	She seeketh wool, and flax,
c77201	and worketh willingly with her hands.
c77202	She is like the merchants' ships;
c77203	she bringeth her food from afar.
c77204	She riseth also while it is yet night,
c77205	and giveth meat to her household,
c77206	and a portion to her maidens.
c77207	She considereth a field,
c77208	and buyeth
c77209	it: with the fruit of her hands she planteth a vineyard.
c77210	She girdeth her loins with strength,
c77211	and strengtheneth her arms.
c77212	She perceiveth
c77213	that her merchandise <i>is</i> good:
c77214	her candle goeth not out by night.
c77215	She layeth her hands to the spindle,
c77216	and her hands hold the distaff.
c77217	She stretcheth out her hand to the poor;
c77218	yea, she reacheth forth her hands to the needy.
c77219	She is not afraid of the snow for her household:
c77220	for all her household <i>are</i> clothed with scarlet.
c77221	She maketh herself coverings of tapestry;
c77222	her clothing <i>is</i> silk and purple.
c77223	Her husband is known in the gates,
c77224	when he sitteth among the elders of the land.
c77225	She maketh fine linen,
c77226	and selleth
c77227	<i>it;</i> and delivereth girdles unto the merchant.
c77228	Strength and honour <i>are</i> her clothing;
c77229	and she shall rejoice in time to come.
c77230	She openeth her mouth with wisdom;
c77231	and in her tongue <i>is</i> the law of kindness.
c77232	She looketh well to the ways of her household,
c77233	and eateth not the bread of idleness.
c77234	Her children arise up,
c77235	and call her blessed;
c77236	her husband
c77237	<i>also,</i> and he praiseth her.
c77238	Many daughters have done virtuously,
c77239	but thou excellest them all.
c77240	Favour <i>is</i> deceitful,
c77241	and beauty <i>is</i> vain:
c77242	<i>but</i> a woman <i>that</i> feareth the LORD,
c77243	she shall be praised.
c77244	Give her of the fruit of her hands;
c77245	and let her own works praise her in the gates.
c77246	Now it came to pass in the days
c77247	when the judges ruled,
c77248	that there was a famine in the land.
c77249	And a certain man of Bethlehemjudah went
c77250	to sojourn in the country of Moab,
c77251	he, and his wife, and his two sons.
c77252	And the name of the man <i>was</i> Elimelech,
c77253	and the name of his wife Naomi,
c77254	and the name of his two sons Mahlon and Chilion,
c77255	Ephrathites of Bethlehemjudah.
c77256	And they came into the country of Moab,
c77257	and continued there.
c77258	And Elimelech Naomi's husband died;
c77259	and she was left, and her two sons.
c77260	And they took them wives of the women of Moab;
c77261	the name of the one <i>was</i> Orpah,
c77262	and the name of the other Ruth:
c77263	and they dwelled there about ten years.
c77264	And Mahlon and Chilion died also both
c77265	of them; and the woman was left of her two sons and her husband.
c77266	Then she arose with her daughters in law,
c77267	that she might return from the country of Moab:
c77268	for she had heard in the country of Moab
c77269	how that the LORD had visited his people
c77270	in giving them bread.
c77271	Wherefore she went forth out of the place
c77272	where she was,
c77273	and her two daughters in law with her;
c77274	and they went on the way
c77275	to return unto the land of Judah.
c77276	And Naomi said unto her two daughters in law,
c77277	Go,
c77278	return
c77279	each to her mother's house:
c77280	the LORD deal kindly with
c77281	you, as ye have dealt with the dead, and with me.
c77282	The LORD grant
c77283	you that ye may find rest,
c77284	each <i>of you</i> in the house of her husband.
c77285	Then she kissed
c77286	them; and they lifted up their voice,
c77287	and wept.
c77288	And they said
c77289	unto her, Surely we will return with thee unto thy people.
c77290	And Naomi said,
c77291	Turn again,
c77292	my daughters:
c77293	why will ye go with
c77294	me? <i>are</i> there yet <i>any more</i> sons in my womb,
c77295	that they may be your husbands?
c77296	Turn again,
c77297	my daughters,
c77298	go
c77299	<i>your way;</i> for I am too old
c77300	to have an husband.
c77301	If I should say,
c77302	I have hope,
c77303	<i>if</i> I should have an husband also to night,
c77304	and should also bear sons;
c77305	Would ye tarry for them
c77306	till they were grown?
c77307	would ye stay for them
c77308	from having husbands?
c77309	nay,
c77310	my daughters;
c77311	for it grieveth me much for
c77312	your sakes that the hand of the LORD is gone out against me.
c77313	And they lifted up their voice,
c77314	and wept again:
c77315	and Orpah kissed her mother in law;
c77316	but Ruth clave unto her.
c77317	And she said,
c77318	Behold, thy sister in law is gone back unto her people, and unto her gods:
c77319	return thou after thy sister in law.
c77320	And Ruth said,
c77321	Intreat me not
c77322	to leave
c77323	thee, <i>or</i> to return from following after
c77324	thee: for
c77325	whither thou goest,
c77326	I will go;
c77328	and where thou lodgest,
c77329	I will lodge:
c77330	thy people <i>shall be</i> my people,
c77331	and thy God my God:
c77332	Where thou diest,
c77333	will I die,
c77334	and there will I be buried:
c77335	the LORD do so
c77336	to me, and more also,
c77337	<i>if ought</i> but
c77338	death part thee and me.
c77339	When she saw
c77340	that she was stedfastly minded
c77341	to go with
c77342	her, then she left
c77343	speaking unto her.
c77344	So they two went
c77345	until they came to Bethlehem.
c77346	And it came to pass,
c77347	when they were come to Bethlehem,
c77348	that all the city was moved about
c77349	them, and they said,
c77350	<i>Is</i> this Naomi?
c77351	And she said unto
c77352	them, Call me not Naomi,
c77353	call me Mara:
c77354	for the Almighty hath dealt very bitterly with me.
c77355	I went out full,
c77356	and the LORD hath brought me home again empty:
c77357	why <i>then</i> call ye me Naomi,
c77358	seeing the LORD hath testified
c77359	against me, and the Almighty hath afflicted me?
c77360	So Naomi returned,
c77361	and Ruth the Moabitess, her daughter in law, with her,
c77362	which returned out of the country of Moab:
c77363	and they came to Bethlehem in the beginning of barley harvest.
c77364	And Naomi had a kinsman of her husband's, a mighty man of wealth, of the family of Elimelech;
c77365	and his name <i>was</i> Boaz.
c77366	And Ruth the Moabitess said unto Naomi,
c77367	Let me now go to the field,
c77368	and glean ears of corn
c77369	after <i>him</i> in whose sight I shall find grace.
c77370	And she said
c77371	unto her, Go,
c77372	my daughter.
c77373	And she went,
c77374	and came,
c77375	and gleaned in the field after the reapers:
c77376	and her hap was to light
c77377	on a part of the field <i>belonging</i> unto Boaz,
c77378	who <i>was</i> of the kindred of Elimelech.
c77379	And, behold,
c77380	Boaz came from Bethlehem,
c77381	and said unto the reapers,
c77382	The LORD <i>be</i> with
c77383	you. And they answered
c77384	him, The LORD bless thee.
c77385	Then said Boaz unto his servant
c77386	that was set over the reapers,
c77387	Whose damsel <i>is</i> this?
c77388	And the servant that was set over the reapers answered
c77390	and said,
c77391	It <i>is</i> the Moabitish damsel
c77392	that came back with Naomi out of the country of Moab:
c77393	And she said,
c77394	I pray you, let me glean
c77395	and gather after the reapers among the sheaves:
c77396	so she came,
c77397	and hath continued even from the morning until now,
c77398	that she tarried a little in the house.
c77399	Then said Boaz unto Ruth,
c77400	Hearest thou not,
c77401	my daughter?
c77402	Go not
c77403	to glean in another field,
c77404	neither go from hence,
c77405	but abide here fast by my maidens:
c77406	<i>Let</i> thine eyes <i>be</i> on the field
c77407	that they do reap,
c77408	and go thou after
c77409	them: have I not charged the young men
c77410	that they shall not touch
c77411	thee? and when thou art athirst,
c77412	go unto the vessels,
c77413	and drink
c77414	of <i>that</i> which the young men have drawn.
c77415	Then she fell on her face,
c77416	and bowed herself to the ground,
c77417	and said unto
c77418	him, Why have I found grace in thine eyes,
c77419	that thou shouldest take knowledge
c77420	of me, seeing I <i>am</i> a stranger?
c77421	And Boaz answered
c77422	and said
c77423	unto her, It hath fully been shewed me, all
c77424	that thou hast done unto thy mother in law since the death of thine husband:
c77425	and <i>how</i> thou hast left thy father and thy mother, and the land of thy nativity,
c77426	and art come unto a people
c77427	which thou knewest not heretofore.
c77428	The LORD recompense thy work,
c77429	and a full reward be given thee of the LORD God of Israel,
c77431	under whose wings thou art come to trust.
c77432	Then she said,
c77433	Let me find favour in thy sight,
c77434	my lord;
c77435	for that thou hast comforted
c77436	me, and for that thou hast spoken friendly unto thine handmaid,
c77437	though I be not like unto one of thine handmaidens.
c77438	And Boaz said unto her, At mealtime
c77439	come thou hither,
c77440	and eat of the bread,
c77441	and dip thy morsel in the vinegar.
c77442	And she sat beside the reapers:
c77443	and he reached her parched
c77444	<i>corn,</i> and she did eat,
c77445	and was sufficed,
c77446	and left.
c77447	And when she was risen up
c77448	to glean,
c77449	Boaz commanded his young men,
c77450	saying,
c77451	Let her glean even among the sheaves,
c77452	and reproach her not:
c77453	And let fall also <i>some</i> of the handfuls of purpose
c77454	for her, and leave
c77455	<i>them,</i> that she may glean
c77456	<i>them,</i> and rebuke her not.
c77457	So she gleaned in the field until even,
c77458	and beat out
c77459	that she had gleaned:
c77460	and it was about an ephah of barley.
c77461	And she took <i>it</i> up,
c77462	and went into the city:
c77463	and her mother in law saw
c77464	what she had gleaned:
c77465	and she brought forth,
c77466	and gave
c77467	to her that she had reserved after she was sufficed.
c77468	And her mother in law said
c77469	unto her, Where hast thou gleaned to day?
c77470	and where wroughtest
c77471	thou? blessed be he that did take knowledge
c77472	of thee. And she shewed her mother in law
c77473	with whom she had wrought,
c77474	and said,
c77475	The man's name
c77476	with whom I wrought to day
c77477	<i>is</i> Boaz.
c77478	And Naomi said unto her daughter in law,
c77479	Blessed <i>be</i> he of the LORD,
c77480	who hath not left off his kindness to the living and to the dead.
c77481	And Naomi said
c77482	unto her, The man <i>is</i> near of kin
c77483	unto us, one of our next kinsmen.
c77484	And Ruth the Moabitess said,
c77485	He said unto me also,
c77486	by my young men,
c77488	Thou shalt keep fast
c77489	until they have ended all my harvest.
c77491	And Naomi said unto Ruth her daughter in law,
c77492	<i>It is</i> good,
c77493	my daughter,
c77494	that thou go out with his maidens,
c77495	that they meet thee not in any other field.
c77496	So she kept fast by the maidens of Boaz
c77497	to glean
c77498	unto the end of barley harvest and of wheat harvest;
c77499	and dwelt with her mother in law.
c77500	Then Naomi her mother in law said
c77501	unto her, My daughter,
c77502	shall I not seek rest
c77503	for thee, that it may be well with thee?
c77504	And now
c77505	<i>is</i> not Boaz of our kindred,
c77506	with whose maidens thou wast?
c77507	Behold, he winnoweth barley to night in the threshingfloor.
c77508	Wash
c77509	thyself therefore, and anoint
c77510	thee, and put thy raiment upon
c77511	thee, and get thee down to the floor:
c77512	<i>but</i> make not thyself known unto the man,
c77513	until he shall have done
c77514	eating
c77515	and drinking.
c77516	And it shall be,
c77517	when he lieth down,
c77518	that thou shalt mark the place
c77519	where he shall lie,
c77520	and thou shalt go in,
c77521	and uncover his feet,
c77522	and lay thee down;
c77523	and he will tell
c77524	thee what thou shalt do.
c77525	And she said unto
c77526	her, All
c77527	that thou sayest unto
c77528	me I will do.
c77529	And she went down unto the floor,
c77530	and did according to all
c77531	that her mother in law bade her.
c77532	And when Boaz had eaten
c77533	and drunk,
c77534	and his heart was merry,
c77535	he went
c77536	to lie down at the end of the heap of corn:
c77537	and she came softly,
c77538	and uncovered his feet,
c77539	and laid her down.
c77540	And it came to pass at midnight,
c77541	that the man was afraid,
c77542	and turned himself:
c77543	and, behold,
c77544	a woman lay at his feet.
c77545	And he said,
c77546	Who <i>art</i> thou?
c77547	And she answered,
c77548	I <i>am</i> Ruth thine handmaid:
c77549	spread therefore thy skirt over thine handmaid;
c77550	for thou <i>art</i> a near kinsman.
c77551	And he said,
c77552	Blessed <i>be</i> thou of the LORD,
c77553	my daughter:
c77554	<i>for</i> thou hast shewed more kindness in the latter end than at the beginning,
c77555	inasmuch as thou followedst not young men,
c77556	whether poor
c77557	or rich.
c77558	And now,
c77559	my daughter,
c77560	fear not;
c77561	to thee all
c77562	that thou requirest:
c77563	I will do
c77564	for all the city of my people doth know
c77565	that thou <i>art</i> a virtuous woman.
c77566	And now
c77567	it is true
c77568	that I <i>am thy</i> near kinsman:
c77569	howbeit there is a kinsman
c77570	nearer than I.
c77571	Tarry this night,
c77572	and it shall be in the morning,
c77573	<i>that</i> if he will perform unto thee the part of a kinsman,
c77574	well;
c77575	let him do the kinsman's part:
c77576	but if he will not
c77577	do the part of a kinsman
c77578	to thee, then will I do the part of a kinsman
c77579	to thee, <i>as</i> the LORD liveth:
c77580	lie down until the morning.
c77581	And she lay at his feet until the morning:
c77582	and she rose up
c77583	before one could know another.
c77584	And he said,
c77585	Let it not be known
c77586	that a woman came into the floor.
c77587	Also he said,
c77588	Bring the vail
c77589	that <i>thou hast</i> upon
c77590	thee, and hold
c77591	it. And when she held
c77592	it, he measured six <i>measures</i> of barley,
c77593	and laid <i>it</i> on
c77594	her: and she went into the city.
c77595	And when she came to her mother in law,
c77596	she said,
c77597	Who <i>art</i> thou,
c77598	my daughter?
c77599	And she told her all
c77600	that the man had done to her.
c77601	And she said,
c77602	These six <i>measures</i> of barley gave
c77603	he me; for he said to
c77604	me, Go not empty unto thy mother in law.
c77605	Then said
c77606	she, Sit still,
c77607	my daughter,
c77608	until thou know
c77609	how the matter will fall:
c77610	for the man will not be in rest,
c77611	until he have finished the thing this day.
c77612	Then went Boaz up to the gate,
c77613	and sat him down there:
c77614	and, behold, the kinsman of whom Boaz spake came by;
c77615	unto whom
c77616	he said,
c77617	turn aside,
c77618	sit down here.
c77619	Ho, such a one!
c77620	And he turned aside,
c77621	and sat down.
c77622	And he took ten men of the elders of the city,
c77623	and said,
c77624	Sit ye down here.
c77625	And they sat down.
c77626	And he said unto the kinsman,
c77627	a parcel
c77628	which <i>was</i> our brother Elimelech's:
c77629	Naomi, that is come again out of the country of Moab, selleth
c77630	of land,
c77631	And I thought
c77632	to advertise
c77633	thee, saying,
c77634	Buy <i>it</i> before the inhabitants, and before the elders of my people.
c77635	If thou wilt redeem
c77636	<i>it,</i> redeem
c77637	<i>it:</i> but if thou wilt not redeem
c77638	<i>it, then</i> tell
c77639	me, that I may know:
c77640	for <i>there is</i> none to redeem <i>it</i> beside
c77642	thee; and I <i>am</i> after
c77643	thee. And he said,
c77644	I will redeem <i>it.</i>
c77645	Then said Boaz,
c77646	What day
c77647	thou buyest the field of the hand of Naomi,
c77648	thou must buy <i>it</i> also of Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of the dead,
c77649	to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance.
c77650	And the kinsman said,
c77651	I cannot
c77652	redeem <i>it</i> for myself, lest I mar mine own inheritance: redeem
c77654	thou my right to thyself; for I cannot redeem <i>it.</i>
c77657	Now this <i>was the manner</i> in former time in Israel concerning redeeming and concerning changing,
c77658	for to confirm all things;
c77659	a man plucked off his shoe,
c77660	and gave <i>it</i> to his neighbour:
c77661	and this <i>was</i> a testimony in Israel.
c77662	Therefore the kinsman said unto Boaz,
c77663	Buy
c77664	<i>it</i> for thee. So he drew off his shoe.
c77665	And Boaz said unto the elders, and <i>unto</i> all the people,
c77666	Ye <i>are</i> witnesses this day,
c77667	that I have bought all
c77668	that <i>was</i> Elimelech's,
c77669	and all
c77670	that <i>was</i> Chilion's and Mahlon's,
c77671	of the hand of Naomi.
c77672	Moreover Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of Mahlon, have I purchased to be my wife,
c77673	to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance,
c77674	that the name of the dead be not cut off from among his brethren, and from the gate of his place:
c77675	ye <i>are</i> witnesses this day.
c77676	And all the people that <i>were</i> in the gate,
c77678	and the elders, said,
c77679	<i>We are</i> witnesses.
c77680	The LORD make the woman
c77681	that is come into thine house
c77682	like Rachel and like Leah,
c77683	which two did build the house of Israel:
c77684	and do thou worthily in Ephratah,
c77685	and be famous in Bethlehem:
c77686	And let thy house be like the house of Pharez,
c77687	whom Tamar bare unto Judah,
c77688	of the seed
c77689	which the LORD shall give thee of this young woman.
c77690	So Boaz took Ruth,
c77691	and she was his wife:
c77692	and when he went in unto
c77693	her, the LORD gave her conception,
c77694	and she bare a son.
c77695	And the women said unto Naomi,
c77696	Blessed <i>be</i> the LORD,
c77697	which hath not left thee this day without a kinsman,
c77698	that his name may be famous in Israel.
c77699	And he shall be unto thee a restorer of <i>thy</i> life,
c77700	and a nourisher of thine old age:
c77701	for thy daughter in law,
c77702	which loveth
c77703	hath born him.
c77704	thee, which is better to thee than seven sons,
c77705	And Naomi took the child,
c77706	and laid it in her bosom,
c77707	and became nurse unto it.
c77708	And the women her neighbours gave it a name,
c77709	saying,
c77710	There is a son born to Naomi;
c77711	and they called his name Obed:
c77712	he <i>is</i> the father of Jesse, the father of David.
c77713	Now these <i>are</i> the generations of Pharez:
c77714	Pharez begat Hezron,
c77715	And Hezron begat Ram,
c77716	and Ram begat Amminadab,
c77717	And Amminadab begat Nahshon,
c77718	and Nahshon begat Salmon,
c77719	And Salmon begat Boaz,
c77720	and Boaz begat Obed,
c77721	And Obed begat Jesse,
c77722	and Jesse begat David.
c77723	The song of songs,
c77724	which <i>is</i> Solomon's.
c77725	Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth:
c77726	for thy love <i>is</i> better than wine.
c77727	Because of the savour of thy good ointments
c77728	<i>is as</i> ointment
c77729	poured forth,
c77730	thy name
c77731	therefore do the virgins love thee.
c77732	Draw
c77733	me, we will run after
c77734	thee: the king hath brought me into his chambers:
c77735	we will be glad
c77736	and rejoice
c77737	in thee, we will remember thy love more than wine:
c77738	the upright love thee.
c77739	I <i>am</i> black,
c77740	but comely,
c77741	O ye daughters of Jerusalem,
c77742	as the tents of Kedar, as the curtains of Solomon.
c77743	Look not
c77744	upon me, because I <i>am</i> black,
c77745	because the sun hath looked
c77746	upon me: my mother's children were angry
c77747	with me; they made
c77748	me the keeper of the vineyards;
c77749	vineyard
c77750	<i>but</i> mine own
c77751	have I not kept.
c77752	Tell
c77753	me, O thou whom my soul loveth,
c77754	where thou feedest,
c77755	where thou makest <i>thy flock</i> to rest at noon:
c77756	for why should I be as one that turneth aside by the flocks of thy companions?
c77757	If thou know not,
c77758	O thou fairest among women,
c77759	go thy way forth by the footsteps of the flock,
c77760	and feed thy kids beside the shepherds' tents.
c77761	I have compared thee, O my love, to a company of horses in Pharaoh's chariots.
c77763	Thy cheeks are comely with rows
c77764	<i>of jewels,</i> thy neck with chains <i>of gold.</i>
c77765	We will make thee borders of gold with studs of silver.
c77766	While the king <i>sitteth</i> at his table,
c77767	my spikenard sendeth forth the smell thereof.
c77768	A bundle of myrrh <i>is</i> my wellbeloved
c77769	unto me; he shall lie all night betwixt my breasts.
c77770	My beloved <i>is</i> unto me <i>as</i> a cluster of camphire in the vineyards of Engedi.
c77771	Behold, thou <i>art</i> fair,
c77772	my love;
c77773	behold, thou <i>art</i> fair;
c77774	thou <i>hast</i> doves' eyes.
c77775	Behold, thou <i>art</i> fair,
c77776	my beloved,
c77777	yea, pleasant:
c77778	also our bed <i>is</i> green.
c77779	The beams of our house <i>are</i> cedar,
c77780	<i>and</i> our rafters of fir.
c77781	I <i>am</i> the rose of Sharon,
c77782	<i>and</i> the lily of the valleys.
c77783	As the lily among thorns,
c77784	so <i>is</i> my love among the daughters.
c77785	As the apple tree among the trees of the wood,
c77786	so <i>is</i> my beloved among the sons.
c77787	under his shadow with great delight,
c77788	I sat down
c77789	and his fruit <i>was</i> sweet to my taste.
c77790	He brought me to the banqueting house,
c77791	and his banner over me <i>was</i> love.
c77792	Stay me with flagons,
c77793	comfort me with apples:
c77794	for I <i>am</i> sick of love.
c77795	His left hand <i>is</i> under my head,
c77796	and his right hand doth embrace me.
c77797	I charge
c77798	you, O ye daughters of Jerusalem,
c77799	by the roes, and by the hinds of the field,
c77800	that ye stir not up,
c77801	nor awake <i>my</i> love,
c77802	till he please.
c77803	The voice of my beloved!
c77804	behold, he cometh
c77805	leaping upon the mountains,
c77806	skipping upon the hills.
c77807	My beloved is like a roe or a young hart:
c77808	behold, he standeth behind our wall,
c77809	he looketh forth at the windows,
c77810	shewing himself through the lattice.
c77811	My beloved spake,
c77812	and said
c77813	unto me, Rise up,
c77814	my love, my fair one,
c77815	and come away.
c77816	For, lo, the winter is past,
c77817	the rain is over
c77818	<i>and</i> gone;
c77819	The flowers appear on the earth;
c77820	the time of the singing <i>of birds</i> is come,
c77821	and the voice of the turtle is heard in our land;
c77822	The fig tree putteth forth her green figs,
c77823	and the vines <i>with</i> the tender grape give a <i>good</i> smell.
c77824	Arise, my love, my fair one, and come away.
c77827	O my dove, <i>that art</i> in the clefts of the rock, in the secret <i>places</i> of the stairs,
c77828	let me see thy countenance,
c77829	let me hear thy voice;
c77830	for sweet <i>is</i> thy voice,
c77831	and thy countenance <i>is</i> comely.
c77832	Take us the foxes, the little foxes,
c77833	that spoil the vines:
c77834	for our vines <i>have</i> tender grapes.
c77835	My beloved
c77836	<i>is</i> mine, and I
c77837	<i>am</i> his: he feedeth among the lilies.
c77838	Until the day break,
c77839	and the shadows flee away,
c77840	turn,
c77841	and be thou like
c77842	my beloved,
c77843	a roe
c77844	or a young hart upon the mountains of Bether.
c77845	By night on my bed I sought
c77846	him whom my soul loveth:
c77847	I sought
c77848	him, but I found him not.
c77849	I will rise now,
c77850	and go about the city in the streets, and in the broad ways
c77851	I will seek
c77852	him whom my soul loveth:
c77853	I sought
c77854	him, but I found him not.
c77855	The watchmen that go about the city found
c77857	ye him whom my soul loveth?
c77858	me: <i>to whom I said,</i> Saw
c77859	<i>It was</i> but a little
c77860	that I passed from
c77861	them, but I found
c77862	him whom my soul loveth:
c77863	I held
c77864	him, and would not let him go,
c77865	until I had brought him into my mother's house, and into the chamber of her that conceived me.
c77866	I charge
c77867	you, O ye daughters of Jerusalem,
c77868	by the roes, and by the hinds of the field,
c77869	that ye stir not up,
c77870	nor awake <i>my</i> love,
c77871	till he please.
c77872	Who <i>is</i> this that cometh out of the wilderness like pillars of smoke,
c77873	perfumed with myrrh and frankincense, with all powders of the merchant?
c77874	Behold his bed,
c77875	which <i>is</i> Solomon's;
c77876	threescore valiant men <i>are</i> about it, of the valiant of Israel.
c77877	They all hold swords,
c77878	<i>being</i> expert in war:
c77879	every man
c77880	<i>hath</i> his sword upon his thigh because of fear in the night.
c77881	King Solomon made himself a chariot of the wood of Lebanon.
c77882	He made the pillars thereof <i>of</i> silver,
c77883	the bottom thereof <i>of</i> gold,
c77884	the covering of it <i>of</i> purple,
c77885	the midst thereof being paved <i>with</i> love, for the daughters of Jerusalem.
c77886	Go forth,
c77887	and behold
c77888	O ye daughters of Zion,
c77889	king Solomon
c77890	with the crown
c77891	wherewith his mother crowned him in the day of his espousals, and in the day of the gladness of his heart.
c77892	Behold, thou <i>art</i> fair,
c77893	my love;
c77894	behold, thou <i>art</i> fair;
c77895	thou <i>hast</i> doves' eyes within thy locks:
c77896	thy hair <i>is</i> as a flock of goats,
c77897	that appear from mount Gilead.
c77898	Thy teeth <i>are</i> like a flock <i>of sheep that are even</i> shorn,
c77899	which came up from the washing;
c77900	whereof every one bear twins,
c77901	and none <i>is</i> barren among them.
c77902	Thy lips <i>are</i> like a thread of scarlet,
c77903	and thy speech <i>is</i> comely:
c77904	thy temples <i>are</i> like a piece of a pomegranate within thy locks.
c77905	Thy neck <i>is</i> like the tower of David
c77906	builded for an armoury,
c77907	whereon there hang a thousand bucklers,
c77908	all shields of mighty men.
c77909	Thy two breasts <i>are</i> like two young
c77910	roes that are twins,
c77911	which feed among the lilies.
c77912	Until the day break,
c77913	and the shadows flee away,
c77914	I will get me to the mountain of myrrh, and to the hill of frankincense.
c77915	Thou <i>art</i> all fair,
c77916	my love;
c77917	<i>there is</i> no spot in thee.
c77919	<i>my</i> spouse, with me from Lebanon:
c77920	Come with me from Lebanon,
c77921	look from the top of Amana, from the top of Shenir and Hermon,
c77922	from the lions' dens, from the mountains of the leopards.
c77923	Thou hast ravished my heart,
c77924	my sister, <i>my</i> spouse;
c77925	thou hast ravished my heart with one of thine eyes,
c77926	with one chain of thy neck.
c77927	How fair is thy love,
c77928	my sister, <i>my</i> spouse!
c77929	how much better is thy love than wine!
c77930	and the smell of thine ointments than all spices!
c77931	Thy lips, O <i>my</i> spouse, drop <i>as</i> the honeycomb:
c77933	honey and milk <i>are</i> under thy tongue;
c77934	and the smell of thy garments <i>is</i> like the smell of Lebanon.
c77935	A garden inclosed
c77936	<i>is</i> my sister, <i>my</i> spouse;
c77937	a spring shut up,
c77938	a fountain sealed.
c77939	Thy plants <i>are</i> an orchard of pomegranates, with pleasant fruits;
c77940	camphire, with spikenard,
c77941	Spikenard and saffron; calamus and cinnamon, with all trees of frankincense;
c77942	myrrh and aloes, with all the chief spices:
c77943	A fountain of gardens,
c77944	a well of living waters,
c77945	and streams from Lebanon.
c77946	Awake,
c77947	O north
c77948	wind; and come,
c77949	thou south;
c77950	blow upon my garden,
c77951	<i>that</i> the spices thereof may flow out.
c77952	Let my beloved come into his garden,
c77953	and eat his pleasant fruits.
c77954	I am come into my garden,
c77955	my sister, <i>my</i> spouse:
c77956	I have gathered my myrrh with my spice;
c77957	I have eaten my honeycomb with my honey;
c77958	I have drunk my wine with my milk:
c77959	eat,
c77960	O friends;
c77961	drink,
c77962	yea, drink abundantly,
c77963	O beloved.
c77964	I sleep,
c77965	but my heart waketh:
c77966	<i>it is</i> the voice of my beloved
c77967	that knocketh,
c77968	<i>saying,</i> Open
c77969	to me, my sister, my love, my dove, my undefiled:
c77970	for my head is filled with dew,
c77971	<i>and</i> my locks with the drops of the night.
c77972	I have put off my coat;
c77973	how shall I put it on?
c77974	I have washed my feet;
c77975	how shall I defile them?
c77976	My beloved put in his hand by the hole
c77977	<i>of the door,</i> and my bowels were moved for him.
c77978	I rose up
c77979	to open to my beloved;
c77980	and my hands dropped <i>with</i> myrrh,
c77981	and my fingers <i>with</i> sweet smelling myrrh, upon the handles of the lock.
c77982	I opened to my beloved;
c77983	but my beloved had withdrawn
c77984	himself, <i>and</i> was gone:
c77985	my soul failed
c77986	when he spake:
c77987	I sought
c77988	him, but I could not find
c77989	him; I called
c77990	him, but he gave me no answer.
c77991	The watchmen that went about the city found
c77993	me, they smote
c77994	me, they wounded
c77995	me; the keepers of the walls took away my veil from me.
c77996	I charge
c77997	you, O daughters of Jerusalem,
c77998	if ye find my beloved,
c77999	that ye tell
c78000	him, that I <i>am</i> sick of love.
c78001	What <i>is</i> thy beloved more than <i>another</i> beloved,
c78002	O thou fairest among women?
c78003	what <i>is</i> thy beloved more than <i>another</i> beloved,
c78004	that thou dost so charge us?
c78005	My beloved <i>is</i> white and ruddy,
c78006	the chiefest among ten thousand.
c78007	His head <i>is as</i> the most fine gold,
c78008	his locks <i>are</i> bushy,
c78009	<i>and</i> black as a raven.
c78010	His eyes <i>are</i> as <i>the eyes</i> of doves by the rivers of waters,
c78011	washed with milk,
c78012	<i>and</i> fitly set.
c78013	His cheeks <i>are</i> as a bed of spices,
c78014	<i>as</i> sweet flowers:
c78015	his lips <i>like</i> lilies,
c78016	dropping sweet smelling myrrh.
c78017	His hands <i>are as</i> gold rings
c78018	set with the beryl:
c78019	his belly <i>is as</i> bright ivory
c78020	overlaid <i>with</i> sapphires.
c78021	His legs <i>are as</i> pillars of marble,
c78022	set upon sockets of fine gold:
c78023	his countenance <i>is</i> as Lebanon,
c78024	excellent as the cedars.
c78025	His mouth <i>is</i> most sweet:
c78026	yea, he <i>is</i> altogether lovely.
c78027	This <i>is</i> my beloved,
c78028	and this <i>is</i> my friend,
c78029	O daughters of Jerusalem.
c78030	Whither is thy beloved gone,
c78031	O thou fairest among women?
c78032	whither is thy beloved turned aside?
c78033	that we may seek him with thee.
c78034	My beloved is gone down into his garden, to the beds of spices,
c78035	to feed in the gardens,
c78036	and to gather lilies.
c78037	I <i>am</i> my beloved's,
c78038	and my beloved
c78039	<i>is</i> mine: he feedeth among the lilies.
c78040	Thou <i>art</i> beautiful,
c78041	O my love,
c78042	as Tirzah,
c78043	comely as Jerusalem,
c78044	terrible as <i>an army</i> with banners.
c78045	Turn away thine eyes from
c78046	me, for they have overcome
c78047	me: thy hair <i>is</i> as a flock of goats
c78048	that appear from Gilead.
c78049	Thy teeth <i>are</i> as a flock of sheep
c78050	which go up from the washing,
c78051	whereof every one beareth twins,
c78052	and <i>there is</i> not one barren among them.
c78053	As a piece of a pomegranate <i>are</i> thy temples within thy locks.
c78054	There are threescore queens,
c78055	and fourscore concubines,
c78056	and virgins
c78057	without number.
c78058	My dove, my undefiled is <i>but</i> one; she
c78059	<i>is</i> the <i>only</i> one of her mother, she
c78060	<i>is</i> the choice <i>one</i> of her that bare
c78061	her. The daughters saw
c78062	her, and blessed
c78063	her; <i>yea,</i> the queens and the concubines,
c78064	and they praised her.
c78065	Who <i>is</i> she
c78066	<i>that</i> looketh forth as the morning,
c78067	fair as the moon,
c78068	clear as the sun,
c78069	<i>and</i> terrible as <i>an army</i> with banners?
c78070	I went down into the garden of nuts
c78071	to see the fruits of the valley,
c78072	<i>and</i> to see
c78073	whether the vine flourished,
c78074	<i>and</i> the pomegranates budded.
c78075	Or ever I was aware,
c78076	my soul made me <i>like</i> the chariots of Amminadib.
c78077	Return,
c78078	return,
c78079	O Shulamite;
c78080	return,
c78081	return,
c78082	that we may look
c78083	upon thee. What will ye see in the Shulamite? As it were the company of two armies.
c78084	How beautiful are thy feet with shoes,
c78085	O prince's daughter!
c78086	the joints of thy thighs <i>are</i> like jewels, the work of the hands of a cunning workman.
c78087	Thy navel <i>is like</i> a round goblet,
c78088	<i>which</i> wanteth not liquor:
c78089	thy belly <i>is like</i> an heap of wheat
c78090	set about with lilies.
c78091	Thy two breasts <i>are</i> like two young roes <i>that are</i> twins.
c78092	Thy neck <i>is</i> as a tower of ivory;
c78093	thine eyes <i>like</i> the fishpools in Heshbon, by the gate of Bathrabbim:
c78094	thy nose <i>is</i> as the tower of Lebanon
c78095	which looketh toward Damascus.
c78096	Thine head upon thee <i>is</i> like Carmel,
c78097	and the hair of thine head like purple;
c78098	the king <i>is</i> held in the galleries.
c78099	How fair
c78100	and how pleasant
c78101	art thou, O love,
c78102	for delights!
c78103	This thy stature is like to a palm tree,
c78104	and thy breasts to clusters <i>of grapes.</i>
c78105	I said,
c78106	I will go up to the palm tree,
c78107	I will take hold of the boughs
c78108	thereof: now also thy breasts shall be as clusters of the vine,
c78109	and the smell of thy nose like apples;
c78110	And the roof of thy mouth like the best wine
c78111	for my beloved, that goeth <i>down</i> sweetly,
c78112	causing the lips of those that are asleep to speak.
c78113	I <i>am</i> my beloved's,
c78114	and his desire <i>is</i> toward me.
c78115	Come,
c78116	my beloved,
c78117	let us go forth into the field;
c78118	let us lodge in the villages.
c78119	Let us get up early to the vineyards;
c78120	let us see
c78121	if the vine flourish,
c78122	<i>whether</i> the tender grape appear,
c78123	<i>and</i> the pomegranates bud forth:
c78124	there will I give thee my loves.
c78125	The mandrakes give a smell,
c78126	and at our gates <i>are</i> all manner of pleasant <i>fruits,</i> new and old,
c78127	for thee, O my beloved.
c78128	<i>which</i> I have laid up
c78129	O that thou <i>wert</i> as my brother,
c78130	that sucked the breasts of my mother!
c78131	<i>when</i> I should find thee without,
c78132	I would kiss
c78133	thee; yea, I should not be despised.
c78134	I would lead
c78135	thee, <i>and</i> bring thee into my mother's house,
c78136	<i>who</i> would instruct
c78137	me: I would cause thee to drink of spiced wine of the juice of my pomegranate.
c78138	His left hand <i>should be</i> under my head,
c78139	and his right hand should embrace me.
c78140	I charge
c78141	you, O daughters of Jerusalem,
c78142	that ye stir not up,
c78143	nor awake <i>my</i> love,
c78144	until he please.
c78145	Who <i>is</i> this that cometh up from the wilderness,
c78146	leaning upon her beloved?
c78147	I raised thee up under the apple tree:
c78148	there thy mother brought thee forth:
c78149	there she brought thee forth
c78150	<i>that</i> bare thee.
c78151	Set me as a seal upon thine heart,
c78152	as a seal upon thine arm:
c78153	for love <i>is</i> strong as death;
c78154	jealousy <i>is</i> cruel as the grave:
c78155	the coals thereof <i>are</i> coals of fire, <i>which hath a</i> most vehement flame.
c78156	Many waters cannot
c78157	quench love,
c78158	neither can the floods drown
c78159	it: if <i>a</i> man would give all the substance of his house for love,
c78160	it would utterly be contemned.
c78161	We have a little sister,
c78162	and she hath no breasts:
c78163	what shall we do for our sister in the day
c78164	when she shall be spoken for?
c78165	If she <i>be</i> a wall,
c78166	we will build upon her a palace of silver:
c78167	and if she <i>be</i> a door,
c78168	we will inclose her with boards of cedar.
c78169	I <i>am</i> a wall,
c78170	and my breasts like towers:
c78171	then was I in his eyes as one that found favour.
c78172	Solomon had a vineyard at Baalhamon;
c78173	he let out the vineyard unto keepers;
c78174	every one for the fruit thereof was to bring a thousand <i>pieces</i> of silver.
c78175	My vineyard,
c78176	which <i>is</i> mine,
c78177	<i>is</i> before
c78178	<i>must have</i> a thousand,
c78179	me: thou, O Solomon,
c78180	thereof two hundred.
c78181	and those that keep the fruit
c78182	Thou that dwellest in the gardens,
c78183	the companions hearken to thy voice:
c78184	cause me to hear <i>it.</i>
c78185	Make haste,
c78186	my beloved,
c78187	and be thou like to a roe
c78188	or to a young hart upon the mountains of spices.
c78189	The words of the Preacher, the son of David, king in Jerusalem.
c78190	Vanity of vanities,
c78191	saith the Preacher,
c78192	vanity of vanities;
c78193	all <i>is</i> vanity.
c78194	What profit hath a man of all his labour
c78195	which he taketh under the sun?
c78196	<i>One</i> generation passeth away,
c78197	and <i>another</i> generation cometh:
c78198	but the earth abideth for ever.
c78199	The sun also ariseth,
c78200	and the sun goeth down,
c78201	and hasteth to his place
c78202	where he arose.
c78204	and turneth about unto the north; it whirleth about
c78205	continually,
c78207	The wind goeth toward the south,
c78208	and the wind returneth again according to his circuits.
c78209	All the rivers run into the sea;
c78210	yet the sea
c78211	<i>is</i> not full;
c78212	unto the place
c78213	from whence the rivers come,
c78214	thither they return
c78215	again.
c78216	All things <i>are</i> full of labour;
c78217	man cannot
c78218	utter
c78219	<i>it:</i> the eye is not satisfied
c78220	with seeing,
c78221	nor the ear filled
c78222	with hearing.
c78223	The thing
c78224	that hath been,
c78225	it
c78226	<i>is that</i> which shall be;
c78227	and that
c78228	which is done
c78229	<i>is</i> that
c78230	which shall be done:
c78231	and <i>there is</i> no new <i>thing</i> under the sun.
c78232	Is there <i>any</i> thing
c78233	whereof it may be said,
c78234	See,
c78235	this
c78236	<i>is</i> new? it
c78237	hath been already of old time,
c78238	which was before us.
c78239	<i>There is</i> no remembrance of former
c78240	<i>things;</i> neither shall there be
c78242	<i>any</i> remembrance of <i>things</i> that are to come with <i>those</i> that shall come after.
c78244	I the Preacher was king over Israel in Jerusalem.
c78245	And I gave my heart
c78246	to seek
c78247	and search out by wisdom concerning all
c78248	<i>things</i> that are done under heaven:
c78249	this sore travail
c78250	hath God given to the sons of man
c78251	to be exercised therewith.
c78252	I have seen all the works
c78253	that are done under the sun;
c78254	and, behold,
c78255	all <i>is</i> vanity
c78256	and vexation of spirit.
c78257	<i>That which is</i> crooked cannot
c78258	be made straight:
c78259	and that which is wanting cannot
c78260	be numbered.
c78261	I communed with mine own heart,
c78262	saying,
c78264	Lo, I am come to great estate,
c78265	and have gotten more wisdom than all
c78266	<i>they</i> that have been before me in Jerusalem:
c78267	yea, my heart had great experience of wisdom and knowledge.
c78268	And I gave my heart
c78269	to know wisdom, and to know madness and folly:
c78270	I perceived
c78271	that this also
c78272	is vexation of spirit.
c78273	For in much wisdom <i>is</i> much grief:
c78274	and he that increaseth knowledge
c78275	increaseth sorrow.
c78276	I said in mine heart,
c78277	Go to now,
c78278	I will prove thee with mirth,
c78279	therefore enjoy pleasure:
c78280	and, behold,
c78281	this also <i>is</i> vanity.
c78282	I said of laughter,
c78283	<i>It is</i> mad:
c78284	and of mirth,
c78285	What doeth it?
c78286	I sought in mine heart
c78287	to give myself unto wine,
c78288	yet acquainting mine heart with wisdom;
c78289	and to lay hold on folly,
c78290	till I might see
c78291	what <i>was</i> that good for the sons of men,
c78292	which they should do under the heaven all the days of their life.
c78293	I made me great works;
c78294	I builded me houses;
c78295	I planted me vineyards:
c78296	I made me gardens and orchards,
c78297	and I planted trees in them of all <i>kind of</i> fruits:
c78298	I made me pools of water,
c78299	to water therewith the wood that bringeth forth trees:
c78300	I got <i>me</i> servants and maidens,
c78301	and had servants born in my house;
c78302	also I had great possessions of great and small cattle above all
c78303	that were in Jerusalem before me:
c78304	I gathered me also silver and gold, and the peculiar treasure of kings and of the provinces:
c78305	I gat me men singers and women singers, and the delights of the sons of men, <i>as</i> musical instruments, and that of all sorts.
c78306	So I was great,
c78307	and increased more than all
c78308	that were before me in Jerusalem:
c78309	also my wisdom remained with me.
c78310	And whatsoever
c78311	mine eyes desired
c78312	I kept not
c78313	from them, I withheld not my heart from any joy;
c78314	for my heart rejoiced in all my labour:
c78315	and this was my portion of all my labour.
c78316	Then I looked on all the works
c78317	that my hands had wrought,
c78318	and on the labour
c78319	that I had laboured
c78320	to do:
c78321	and, behold,
c78322	all <i>was</i> vanity
c78323	and vexation of spirit,
c78324	and <i>there was</i> no profit under the sun.
c78325	And I turned
c78326	myself to behold wisdom, and madness, and folly:
c78327	for what <i>can</i> the man
c78328	<i>do</i> that cometh after the king?
c78329	<i>even</i> that which hath been already done.
c78330	Then I saw
c78331	that wisdom excelleth folly,
c78332	as far as light excelleth darkness.
c78333	The wise man's
c78334	eyes <i>are</i> in his head;
c78335	but the fool walketh in darkness:
c78336	and I myself perceived also
c78337	that one event happeneth to them all.
c78338	Then said I in my heart,
c78339	As it happeneth to the fool,
c78340	even to me; and why was I
c78341	so it happeneth
c78342	then more wise?
c78343	Then I said in my heart,
c78344	that this also <i>is</i> vanity.
c78345	For <i>there is</i> no remembrance of the wise more than of the fool for ever;
c78346	seeing that which now <i>is</i> in the days to come shall all be forgotten.
c78347	And how dieth the wise <i>man?</i> as the fool.
c78348	Therefore I hated life;
c78349	because the work that is wrought under the sun <i>is</i> grievous unto
c78351	me: for all <i>is</i> vanity
c78352	and vexation of spirit.
c78353	Yea, I hated all my labour
c78354	which I had taken under the sun:
c78355	because I should leave it unto the man
c78356	that shall be after me.
c78357	And who knoweth
c78358	whether he shall be a wise
c78359	<i>man</i> or a fool?
c78360	yet shall he have rule over all my labour
c78361	wherein I have laboured,
c78362	and wherein I have shewed myself wise under the sun.
c78363	This <i>is</i> also vanity.
c78364	Therefore I went about
c78365	to cause my heart to despair of all the labour
c78366	which I took under the sun.
c78367	For there is a man
c78368	whose labour <i>is</i> in wisdom, and in knowledge, and in equity;
c78369	yet to a man
c78370	that hath not laboured
c78371	therein shall he leave it <i>for</i> his portion.
c78372	This also <i>is</i> vanity
c78373	and a great evil.
c78374	For what hath man of all his labour, and of the vexation of his heart,
c78375	wherein he hath laboured under the sun?
c78376	For all his days <i>are</i> sorrows,
c78377	and his travail grief;
c78378	yea, his heart taketh not rest in the night.
c78379	This is also
c78380	vanity.
c78381	<i>There is</i> nothing better for a man,
c78382	<i>than</i> that he should eat
c78383	and drink,
c78384	and <i>that</i> he should make his soul  enjoy good in his labour. This also I saw,
c78386	that it <i>was</i> from the hand of God.
c78387	For who can eat,
c78388	or who else can hasten <i>hereunto,</i> more than I?
c78389	For <i>God</i> giveth to a man
c78390	that <i>is</i> good in his sight wisdom, and knowledge, and joy:
c78392	but to the sinner he giveth travail,
c78393	to gather
c78394	and to heap up,
c78395	that he may give to <i>him that is</i> good before God.
c78396	This also <i>is</i> vanity
c78397	and vexation of spirit.
c78398	To every <i>thing there is</i> a season,
c78399	and a time to every purpose under the heaven:
c78400	A time
c78401	to be born,
c78402	and a time
c78403	to die;
c78404	a time
c78405	to plant,
c78406	and a time
c78407	to pluck up <i>that which is</i> planted;
c78408	A time
c78409	to kill,
c78410	and a time
c78411	to heal;
c78412	a time
c78413	to break down,
c78414	and a time
c78415	to build up;
c78416	A time
c78417	to weep,
c78418	and a time
c78419	to laugh;
c78420	a time
c78421	to mourn,
c78422	and a time
c78423	to dance;
c78424	A time
c78425	to cast away stones,
c78426	and a time
c78427	to gather stones together;
c78428	a time
c78429	to embrace,
c78430	and a time
c78431	to refrain
c78432	from embracing;
c78433	A time
c78434	to get,
c78435	and a time
c78436	to lose;
c78437	a time
c78438	to keep,
c78439	and a time
c78440	to cast away;
c78441	A time
c78442	to rend,
c78443	and a time
c78444	to sew;
c78445	a time
c78446	to keep silence,
c78447	and a time
c78448	to speak;
c78449	A time
c78450	to love,
c78451	and a time
c78452	to hate;
c78453	a time of war,
c78454	and a time of peace.
c78455	What profit hath he that worketh
c78456	in that wherein he laboureth?
c78457	I have seen the travail,
c78458	which God hath given to the sons of men
c78459	to be exercised in it.
c78460	He hath made every <i>thing</i> beautiful in his time:
c78461	also he hath set the world in their heart,
c78462	so that no man can find out the work
c78463	that God maketh from the beginning to the end.
c78464	I know
c78465	that <i>there is</i> no good
c78466	in them, but for <i>a man</i> to rejoice,
c78467	and to do good in his life.
c78468	And also that every man should eat
c78470	and drink,
c78471	and enjoy the good of all his labour,
c78472	it <i>is</i> the gift of God.
c78473	I know
c78474	that, whatsoever
c78475	God doeth,
c78476	it shall be for ever:
c78477	to
c78478	nothing
c78479	can be put
c78480	from
c78481	it, nor
c78482	any thing taken
c78483	it: and God doeth
c78484	<i>it,</i> that <i>men</i> should fear before him.
c78485	That which hath been
c78487	is now; and that
c78489	which is to be
c78490	hath already been;
c78491	and God requireth that which is past.
c78492	And moreover I saw under the sun
c78493	the place of judgment,
c78494	<i>that</i> wickedness <i>was</i> there;
c78495	and the place of righteousness,
c78496	<i>that</i> iniquity <i>was</i> there.
c78497	I said in mine heart,
c78498	God shall judge the righteous and the wicked:
c78499	for <i>there is</i> a time there for every purpose
c78500	and for every work.
c78501	I said in mine heart concerning the estate of the sons of men,
c78502	that God might manifest
c78504	them, and that they might see that they themselves are beasts.
c78506	For that which befalleth the sons of men befalleth beasts;
c78507	even one thing befalleth
c78508	them: as the one dieth,
c78509	so dieth the other;
c78510	yea, they have all one breath;
c78511	so that a man hath no preeminence above a beast:
c78512	for all <i>is</i> vanity.
c78513	All go unto one place;
c78514	all are of the dust,
c78515	and all turn to dust again.
c78516	Who knoweth
c78517	the spirit of man
c78519	that goeth upward,
c78520	and the spirit of the beast
c78522	that goeth downward to the earth?
c78523	Wherefore I perceive
c78524	that <i>there is</i> nothing better,
c78525	than that a man should rejoice in his own works;
c78526	for that <i>is</i> his portion:
c78527	for who shall bring
c78528	him to see what shall be
c78529	after him?
c78530	So I returned,
c78531	and considered all the oppressions
c78532	that are done under the sun:
c78533	and behold
c78534	the tears of <i>such as were</i> oppressed,
c78535	and they had no comforter;
c78536	and on the side of their oppressors <i>there was</i> power;
c78537	but they had no comforter.
c78538	Wherefore I praised the dead
c78539	which are already dead
c78540	more than the living
c78541	which are yet alive.
c78542	Yea, better <i>is he</i> than both
c78543	they, which hath not yet been,
c78544	who hath not seen the evil work
c78545	that is done under the sun.
c78546	Again, I considered all travail, and every right work,
c78547	that for this a man is envied of his neighbour.
c78548	This <i>is</i> also vanity
c78549	and vexation of spirit.
c78550	The fool foldeth his hands together,
c78551	and eateth his own flesh.
c78552	Better <i>is</i> an handful <i>with</i> quietness, than both the hands full <i>with</i> travail and vexation of spirit.
c78553	Then I returned,
c78554	and I saw vanity under the sun.
c78555	There is one
c78556	<i>alone,</i> and <i>there is</i> not a second;
c78557	yea, he hath neither child nor brother:
c78558	yet <i>is there</i> no end of all his labour;
c78559	neither is his eye satisfied with riches; neither <i>saith he,</i> For whom do I labour,
c78561	and bereave my soul of good?
c78562	This <i>is</i> also vanity,
c78563	yea, it <i>is</i> a sore travail.
c78564	Two <i>are</i> better than one;
c78565	because they have a good reward for their labour.
c78566	For
c78567	if they fall,
c78568	the one will lift up his fellow:
c78569	but woe to him <i>that is</i> alone
c78570	when he falleth;
c78571	for <i>he hath</i> not another
c78572	to help him up.
c78573	Again, if two lie together,
c78574	then they have heat:
c78576	but how can one be warm <i>alone?</i>
c78577	And if one prevail against
c78578	him, two shall withstand
c78579	him; and a threefold cord is not quickly broken.
c78580	Better <i>is</i> a poor and a wise child than an old and foolish king,
c78581	who will no
c78582	more be admonished.
c78583	For out of prison he cometh
c78584	to reign;
c78585	whereas also <i>he that is</i> born in his kingdom becometh poor.
c78586	I considered all the living
c78587	which walk under the sun,
c78588	with the second child
c78589	that shall stand up in his stead.
c78590	<i>There is</i> no end of all the people,
c78591	<i>even</i> of all
c78592	that have been before
c78593	them: they also that come after shall not rejoice
c78594	in him. Surely this also <i>is</i> vanity
c78595	and vexation of spirit.
c78596	Keep thy foot
c78597	when thou goest to the house of God,
c78598	and be more ready
c78599	to hear,
c78600	than to give the sacrifice of fools:
c78601	for they consider not that
c78602	they do evil.
c78603	Be not rash with thy mouth,
c78604	and let not thine heart be hasty
c78605	to utter <i>any</i> thing before God:
c78606	for God <i>is</i> in heaven,
c78607	and thou upon earth:
c78608	therefore let thy words be few.
c78609	For a dream cometh through the multitude of business;
c78610	and a fool's voice <i>is known</i> by multitude of words.
c78611	When thou vowest a vow unto God,
c78612	defer not
c78613	to pay
c78614	it; for <i>he hath</i> no pleasure in fools:
c78615	that which thou hast vowed.
c78616	pay
c78617	Better
c78618	<i>is it</i> that thou shouldest not vow,
c78619	than that thou shouldest vow
c78620	and not pay.
c78621	Suffer not thy mouth
c78622	to cause thy flesh to sin;
c78623	neither say thou before the angel,
c78624	that it <i>was</i> an error:
c78625	wherefore should God be angry at thy voice,
c78626	and destroy the work of thine hands?
c78627	For in the multitude of dreams and many words <i>there are</i> also <i>divers</i> vanities:
c78629	but fear thou God.
c78630	If thou seest the oppression of the poor, and violent perverting of judgment and justice in a province,
c78631	marvel not at the matter:
c78632	for <i>he that is</i> higher than the highest regardeth;
c78633	and <i>there be</i> higher than they.
c78634	Moreover the profit of the earth is for all:
c78636	the king <i>himself</i> is served by the field.
c78637	He that loveth silver
c78638	shall not be satisfied with silver;
c78640	nor he that loveth abundance
c78641	with increase:
c78642	this <i>is</i> also vanity.
c78643	When goods increase,
c78644	they are increased that eat
c78645	them: and what good <i>is there</i> to the owners
c78646	thereof, saving the beholding <i>of them</i> with their eyes?
c78647	The sleep of a labouring man <i>is</i> sweet,
c78648	whether he eat little
c78649	or much:
c78650	but the abundance of the rich
c78651	will not suffer
c78652	him to sleep.
c78653	There is a sore evil
c78654	<i>which</i> I have seen under the sun,
c78655	<i>namely,</i> riches
c78656	kept for the owners thereof to their hurt.
c78657	But those riches perish by evil travail:
c78658	and he begetteth a son,
c78659	and <i>there is</i> nothing in his hand.
c78660	As he came forth of his mother's womb,
c78661	naked shall he return
c78662	to go
c78663	as he came,
c78664	and shall take nothing of his labour,
c78665	which he may carry away in his hand.
c78666	And this also <i>is</i> a sore evil,
c78667	<i>that</i> in all points
c78668	as he came,
c78669	so shall he go:
c78670	and what profit
c78671	hath he that hath laboured for the wind?
c78672	All his days also he eateth in darkness,
c78673	and <i>he hath</i> much sorrow
c78674	and wrath with his sickness.
c78675	Behold
c78676	<i>that</i> which I have seen: <i>it is</i> good
c78677	and comely <i>for one</i> to eat
c78679	and to drink,
c78680	and to enjoy the good of all his labour
c78681	that he taketh under the sun all the days of his life, which
c78682	God giveth
c78683	him: for it <i>is</i> his portion.
c78684	Every man also
c78685	to whom God hath given riches and wealth,
c78686	and hath given him power
c78687	to eat thereof,
c78688	and to take his portion,
c78689	and to rejoice in his labour;
c78690	this
c78691	<i>is</i> the gift of God.
c78692	For he shall not much remember the days of his life;
c78693	because God answereth <i>him</i> in the joy of his heart.
c78694	There is an evil
c78695	which I have seen under the sun,
c78696	and it <i>is</i> common among men:
c78697	A man
c78698	to whom God hath given riches, wealth, and honour,
c78699	so that he wanteth nothing for his soul of all
c78700	that he desireth,
c78701	yet God giveth him not power
c78702	to eat thereof,
c78703	but a stranger eateth
c78704	it: this <i>is</i> vanity,
c78705	and it <i>is</i> an evil disease.
c78706	If a man beget an hundred
c78707	<i>children,</i> and live many years,
c78709	so that the days of his years be many,
c78710	and his soul be not filled with good,
c78711	and also <i>that</i> he have no burial;
c78712	I say,
c78713	<i>that</i> an untimely birth <i>is</i> better than he.
c78714	For he cometh in with vanity,
c78715	and departeth in darkness,
c78716	and his name shall be covered with darkness.
c78717	Moreover he hath not seen the sun,
c78718	nor known
c78719	<i>any thing:</i> this hath more rest than the other.
c78720	Yea, though he live a thousand years twice
c78721	<i>told,</i> yet hath he seen no good:
c78722	do not all go to one place?
c78723	All the labour of man <i>is</i> for his mouth,
c78724	and yet the appetite is not filled.
c78725	For what hath the wise more than the fool?
c78726	what hath the poor,
c78727	that knoweth
c78728	to walk before the living?
c78729	Better <i>is</i> the sight of the eyes
c78730	than the wandering of the desire:
c78731	this <i>is</i> also vanity
c78732	and vexation of spirit.
c78733	That
c78734	which hath been
c78735	is named already,
c78736	and it is known
c78737	that it <i>is</i> man:
c78738	neither may
c78739	he contend
c78740	with him that is mightier than he.
c78741	Seeing there be many things
c78742	that increase vanity,
c78743	what <i>is</i> man the better?
c78744	For who knoweth
c78745	what <i>is</i> good for man in <i>this</i> life, all the days of his vain life
c78746	which he spendeth as a shadow?
c78747	for who can tell a man
c78748	what shall be after him under the sun?
c78749	A good name <i>is</i> better than precious ointment;
c78750	and the day of death than the day
c78751	of one's birth.
c78752	<i>It is</i> better
c78753	to go to the house of mourning,
c78754	than to go to the house of feasting:
c78755	for that <i>is</i> the end of all men;
c78756	and the living will lay <i>it</i> to his heart.
c78757	Sorrow <i>is</i> better than laughter:
c78758	for by the sadness of the countenance the heart is made better.
c78759	The heart of the wise <i>is</i> in the house of mourning;
c78760	but the heart of fools <i>is</i> in the house of mirth.
c78761	<i>It is</i> better
c78762	to hear the rebuke of the wise,
c78763	than for a man
c78764	to hear the song of fools.
c78765	For as the crackling of thorns under a pot,
c78766	so <i>is</i> the laughter of the fool:
c78767	this also <i>is</i> vanity.
c78768	Surely oppression maketh a wise man mad;
c78769	and a gift destroyeth the heart.
c78770	Better <i>is</i> the end of a thing than the beginning
c78771	thereof: <i>and</i> the patient in spirit <i>is</i> better than the proud in spirit.
c78772	Be not hasty in thy spirit
c78773	to be angry:
c78774	for anger resteth in the bosom of fools.
c78775	Say not
c78776	thou, What is
c78777	<i>the cause</i> that the former days were better than these?
c78778	for thou dost not enquire wisely concerning this.
c78779	Wisdom <i>is</i> good with an inheritance:
c78780	and <i>by it there is</i> profit to them that see the sun.
c78781	For wisdom <i>is</i> a defence,
c78782	<i>and</i> money <i>is</i> a defence:
c78783	but the excellency of knowledge
c78784	<i>is, that</i> wisdom giveth life to them that have it.
c78785	Consider the work of God:
c78786	for who can
c78787	make <i>that</i> straight,
c78788	which he hath made crooked?
c78789	In the day of prosperity be joyful,
c78790	but in the day of adversity consider:
c78791	God also hath set the one over against the other, to the end
c78792	that man should find nothing after him.
c78793	All <i>things</i> have I seen in the days of my vanity:
c78794	there is a just
c78795	<i>man</i> that perisheth in his righteousness,
c78796	and there is a wicked
c78797	<i>man</i> that prolongeth <i>his life</i> in his wickedness.
c78798	Be not righteous over much;
c78799	neither make thyself over wise:
c78800	why shouldest thou destroy thyself?
c78801	Be not over much wicked,
c78802	neither be thou foolish:
c78803	why shouldest thou die before thy time?
c78804	<i>It is</i> good
c78805	that thou shouldest take hold of this;
c78806	yea, also from this withdraw not thine hand:
c78807	for he that feareth God shall come forth of them all.
c78808	Wisdom strengtheneth the wise more than ten mighty
c78809	<i>men</i> which are in the city.
c78810	For <i>there is</i> not a just man upon earth,
c78811	that doeth good,
c78812	and sinneth not.
c78813	Also take no heed unto all words
c78814	that are spoken;
c78816	lest thou hear thy servant
c78817	curse thee:
c78818	For oftentimes also thine own heart knoweth
c78819	that thou thyself likewise hast cursed others.
c78820	All this have I proved by wisdom:
c78821	I said,
c78822	I will be wise;
c78823	but it <i>was</i> far from me.
c78824	far off,
c78825	That which is
c78827	and exceeding deep,
c78828	who can find it out?
c78829	I applied mine heart
c78830	to know,
c78831	and to search,
c78832	and to seek out wisdom, and the reason
c78833	<i>of things,</i> and to know
c78834	the wickedness of folly,
c78835	even of foolishness <i>and</i> madness:
c78836	And I find
c78837	more bitter than death
c78838	the woman,
c78839	whose
c78840	heart <i>is</i> snares and nets,
c78841	<i>and</i> her hands <i>as</i> bands:
c78842	whoso pleaseth God shall escape from
c78843	her; but the sinner shall be taken by her.
c78844	Behold,
c78845	this have I found,
c78846	saith the preacher,
c78847	<i>counting</i> one by one,
c78848	to find out the account:
c78849	Which yet my soul seeketh,
c78850	but I find not:
c78851	one man among a thousand have I found;
c78852	but a woman among all those have I not found.
c78853	Lo, this only
c78854	have I found,
c78855	that God hath made man upright;
c78856	but they have sought out many inventions.
c78857	Who <i>is</i> as the wise
c78858	<i>man?</i> and who knoweth the interpretation of a thing?
c78859	a man's wisdom maketh his face to shine,
c78860	and the boldness of his face shall be changed.
c78861	I
c78862	<i>counsel thee</i> to keep the king's commandment,
c78863	and <i>that</i> in regard of the oath of God.
c78864	Be not hasty
c78865	to go out of his sight:
c78866	stand not in an evil thing;
c78867	for
c78868	whatsoever pleaseth him.
c78869	he doeth
c78870	Where the word of a king <i>is, there is</i> power:
c78871	and who may say
c78872	unto him, What doest thou?
c78873	Whoso keepeth the commandment shall feel no evil thing:
c78874	and a wise man's heart discerneth both time and judgment.
c78875	Because to every purpose there is time and judgment,
c78876	therefore the misery of man <i>is</i> great upon him.
c78877	For he knoweth not
c78878	that
c78879	which shall be: for
c78881	him when it shall be?
c78882	who can tell
c78883	<i>There is</i> no man
c78884	that hath power over the spirit
c78885	to retain the spirit;
c78886	neither <i>hath he</i> power in the day of death:
c78887	and <i>there is</i> no discharge in <i>that</i> war;
c78888	neither shall wickedness deliver those that are given to it.
c78889	All this have I seen,
c78890	and applied my heart unto every work
c78891	that is done under the sun:
c78892	<i>there is</i> a time
c78893	wherein one man ruleth over another
c78894	to his own hurt.
c78895	And so I saw
c78896	the wicked buried,
c78897	who had come
c78898	and gone from the place of the holy,
c78899	and they were forgotten in the city
c78900	where they had so done:
c78901	this <i>is</i> also vanity.
c78902	Because sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily,
c78903	therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set
c78904	in them to do evil.
c78905	Though a sinner do evil an hundred times,
c78906	and his <i>days</i> be prolonged,
c78907	yet surely I know
c78908	that it shall be well with them that fear God, which fear
c78909	before him:
c78910	But it shall not be well with the wicked,
c78911	neither shall he prolong <i>his</i> days, <i>which are</i> as a shadow;
c78912	because he feareth not before God.
c78913	There is a vanity
c78914	which is done upon the earth;
c78915	that there be just
c78916	<i>men,</i> unto whom it happeneth according to the work of the wicked;
c78917	again, there be wicked
c78918	<i>men,</i> to whom it happeneth according to the work of the righteous:
c78919	I said
c78920	that this also <i>is</i> vanity.
c78921	Then I commended mirth,
c78922	because a man hath no better thing under the sun,
c78923	than to eat,
c78924	and to drink,
c78925	and to be merry:
c78926	for that shall abide with him of his labour the days of his life,
c78927	which God giveth him under the sun.
c78928	When I applied mine heart
c78929	to know wisdom,
c78930	and to see the business
c78931	that is done upon the earth:
c78932	(for also <i>there is that</i> neither day nor night seeth sleep with his eyes:)
c78933	Then I beheld all the work of God,
c78934	that a man cannot
c78935	find out the work
c78936	that is done under the sun:
c78937	because though a man labour
c78938	to seek <i>it</i> out,
c78939	yet he shall not find
c78940	<i>it;</i> yea further; though a wise <i>man</i> think
c78941	to know
c78942	<i>it,</i> yet shall he not be able
c78943	to find <i>it.</i>
c78944	For all this I considered in my heart
c78945	even to declare all this,
c78946	that the righteous, and the wise, and their works, <i>are</i> in the hand of God:
c78948	no man knoweth either love or hatred <i>by</i> all <i>that is</i> before them.
c78949	All
c78950	<i>things come</i> alike to all:
c78951	<i>there is</i> one event to the righteous, and to the wicked;
c78952	to the good and to the clean, and to the unclean;
c78953	to him that sacrificeth,
c78954	and to him that sacrificeth not:
c78955	as <i>is</i> the good,
c78956	so <i>is</i> the sinner;
c78957	<i>and</i> he that sweareth,
c78958	as <i>he</i> that feareth an oath.
c78959	This <i>is</i> an evil among all
c78960	<i>things</i> that are done under the sun,
c78961	that <i>there is</i> one event unto all:
c78962	yea, also the heart of the sons of men is full of evil,
c78963	and madness <i>is</i> in their heart while they live,
c78964	and after that <i>they go</i> to the dead.
c78965	For to him
c78966	that is joined to all the living
c78967	there is hope:
c78968	for a living dog
c78969	is better than a dead lion.
c78970	For the living know
c78971	that they shall die: but the dead
c78973	know not any thing,
c78974	neither have they any more a reward;
c78975	for the memory of them is forgotten.
c78976	Also their love, and their hatred, and their envy, is now perished;
c78977	neither have they any more a portion for ever in any
c78978	<i>thing</i> that is done under the sun.
c78979	Go
c78980	thy way, eat thy bread with joy,
c78981	and drink thy wine with a merry heart;
c78982	for God now accepteth thy works.
c78983	Let thy garments be always white;
c78984	and let thy head lack no ointment.
c78985	Live joyfully with the wife
c78986	whom thou lovest
c78987	all the days of the life of thy vanity,
c78988	which he hath given thee under the sun,
c78989	all the days of thy vanity:
c78990	for that <i>is</i> thy portion in <i>this</i> life, and in thy labour
c78991	which thou takest under the sun.
c78992	Whatsoever
c78993	thy hand findeth
c78994	to do, do <i>it</i> with thy might;
c78996	for <i>there is</i> no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom, in the grave,
c78997	whither thou goest.
c78998	I returned,
c78999	and saw under the sun,
c79000	that the race <i>is</i> not to the swift,
c79001	nor the battle to the strong,
c79002	neither yet bread to the wise,
c79003	nor yet riches to men of understanding,
c79004	nor yet favour to men of skill;
c79005	but time and chance happeneth to them all.
c79006	For man also knoweth not his time:
c79007	as the fishes
c79008	that are taken in an evil net,
c79009	and as the birds
c79010	that are caught in the snare;
c79011	so <i>are</i> the sons of men snared in an evil time,
c79012	when it falleth suddenly upon them.
c79013	This wisdom have I seen also under the sun,
c79014	and it <i>seemed</i> great unto me:
c79015	<i>There was</i> a little city,
c79016	and few men
c79017	within it; and there came a great king against
c79018	it, and besieged
c79019	it, and built great bulwarks against it:
c79020	Now there was found in it a poor wise man,
c79021	and he by his wisdom delivered the city;
c79022	yet no man remembered that same poor man.
c79023	Then said I,
c79024	Wisdom <i>is</i> better than strength:
c79025	nevertheless the poor man's wisdom <i>is</i> despised,
c79026	and his words
c79027	are not heard.
c79028	The words of wise
c79029	<i>men are</i> heard in quiet
c79030	more than the cry of him that ruleth among fools.
c79031	Wisdom <i>is</i> better than weapons of war:
c79032	but one sinner destroyeth much good.
c79033	Dead flies cause the ointment of the apothecary to send forth a stinking savour:
c79035	<i>so doth</i> a little folly him that is in reputation for wisdom <i>and</i> honour.
c79036	A wise man's heart <i>is</i> at his right hand;
c79037	but a fool's heart at his left.
c79038	Yea also, when he that is a fool walketh by the way,
c79040	his wisdom faileth
c79041	<i>him,</i> and he saith to every one
c79042	<i>that</i> he <i>is</i> a fool.
c79043	If the spirit of the ruler rise up against
c79044	thee, leave not thy place;
c79045	for yielding pacifieth great offences.
c79046	There is an evil
c79047	<i>which</i> I have seen under the sun,
c79048	as an error
c79049	<i>which</i> proceedeth from the ruler:
c79050	Folly is set in great dignity,
c79051	and the rich sit in low place.
c79052	I have seen servants upon horses,
c79053	and princes
c79054	walking as servants upon the earth.
c79055	He that diggeth a pit
c79056	shall fall
c79057	into it; and whoso breaketh an hedge,
c79058	a serpent shall bite him.
c79059	Whoso removeth stones
c79060	shall be hurt
c79061	therewith; <i>and</i> he that cleaveth wood
c79062	shall be endangered thereby.
c79063	If the iron be blunt,
c79064	and he do not whet the edge,
c79065	then must he put to more strength:
c79066	but wisdom <i>is</i> profitable to direct.
c79067	Surely the serpent will bite without enchantment;
c79068	and a babbler is no better.
c79069	The words of a wise man's mouth <i>are</i> gracious;
c79070	but the lips of a fool will swallow up himself.
c79071	The beginning of the words of his mouth <i>is</i> foolishness:
c79072	and the end of his talk <i>is</i> mischievous madness.
c79073	A fool also is full of words:
c79074	a man cannot tell
c79075	what shall be;
c79077	and what shall be after
c79078	him, who can tell him?
c79079	The labour of the foolish wearieth
c79080	every one of them, because he knoweth not
c79081	how to go to the city.
c79082	Woe
c79083	to thee, O land,
c79084	when thy king <i>is</i> a child,
c79085	and thy princes eat in the morning!
c79086	Blessed
c79087	<i>art</i> thou, O land,
c79088	when thy king <i>is</i> the son of nobles,
c79089	and thy princes eat in due season, for strength,
c79090	and not for drunkenness!
c79091	By much slothfulness the building decayeth;
c79092	and through idleness of the hands the house droppeth through.
c79093	A feast is made for laughter,
c79094	and wine maketh merry:
c79095	but money answereth all <i>things.</i>
c79096	Curse not the king, no not in thy thought;
c79097	and curse not the rich in thy bedchamber:
c79098	for a bird of the air shall carry the voice,
c79099	and that which hath wings shall tell the matter.
c79100	Cast thy bread upon the waters:
c79101	for thou shalt find it after many days.
c79102	Give a portion to seven,
c79103	and also to eight;
c79104	for thou knowest not
c79105	what evil shall be upon the earth.
c79106	If the clouds be full
c79107	of rain, they empty <i>themselves</i> upon the earth:
c79108	and if the tree fall toward the south,
c79109	or toward the north,
c79110	in the place
c79111	where the tree falleth,
c79112	there it shall be.
c79113	He that observeth the wind shall not sow;
c79115	and he that regardeth the clouds
c79116	shall not reap.
c79117	As thou knowest not
c79118	what <i>is</i> the way of the spirit,
c79119	<i>nor</i> how the bones <i>do grow</i> in the womb of her that is with child:
c79120	even so thou knowest not the works of God
c79121	who maketh all.
c79122	In the morning sow thy seed,
c79123	and in the evening withhold not thine hand:
c79124	for thou knowest not
c79125	whether shall prosper,
c79126	either this
c79127	or that,
c79128	or whether they both <i>shall be</i> alike good.
c79129	Truly the light <i>is</i> sweet,
c79130	and a pleasant <i>thing it is</i> for the eyes
c79131	to behold the sun:
c79132	But
c79133	if a man live many years,
c79134	<i>and</i> rejoice in them all;
c79135	yet let him remember the days of darkness;
c79136	for they shall be many.
c79137	All
c79138	that cometh
c79139	<i>is</i> vanity.
c79140	Rejoice,
c79141	O young man,
c79142	in thy youth;
c79143	and let thy heart cheer thee in the days of thy youth,
c79144	and walk in the ways of thine heart, and in the sight of thine eyes:
c79145	but know
c79146	thou, that for all these <i>things</i> God will bring thee into judgment.
c79147	Therefore remove sorrow from thy heart,
c79148	and put away evil from thy flesh:
c79149	for childhood and youth <i>are</i> vanity.
c79150	Remember now thy Creator in the days of thy youth,
c79151	while the evil days come not,
c79152	nor the years draw nigh,
c79153	when thou shalt say,
c79154	I have no pleasure in them;
c79155	While the sun, or the light, or the moon, or the stars, be not darkened,
c79156	nor the clouds return after the rain:
c79157	In the day
c79158	when the keepers of the house shall tremble,
c79159	and the strong men shall bow themselves,
c79160	and the grinders cease
c79161	because they are few,
c79162	be darkened,
c79163	and those that look out of the windows
c79164	And the doors shall be shut in the streets,
c79165	when the sound of the grinding is low,
c79166	and he shall rise up at the voice of the bird,
c79167	and all the daughters of musick shall be brought low;
c79168	Also <i>when</i> they shall be afraid of <i>that which is</i> high,
c79169	and fears <i>shall be</i> in the way,
c79170	and the almond tree shall flourish,
c79171	and the grasshopper shall be a burden,
c79172	and desire shall fail:
c79173	because man goeth to his long home,
c79174	and the mourners go about the streets:
c79175	Or ever the silver cord be loosed,
c79176	or the golden bowl be broken,
c79177	or the pitcher be broken at the fountain,
c79178	or the wheel broken at the cistern.
c79179	Then shall the dust return to the earth
c79180	as it was:
c79181	and the spirit shall return unto God
c79182	who gave it.
c79183	Vanity of vanities,
c79184	saith the preacher;
c79185	all <i>is</i> vanity.
c79186	And moreover, because the preacher was wise,
c79187	he still taught the people knowledge;
c79188	yea, he gave good heed,
c79189	and sought out,
c79190	<i>and</i> set in order many proverbs.
c79191	The preacher sought
c79192	to find out acceptable words:
c79193	and <i>that which was</i> written <i>was</i> upright, <i>even</i> words of truth.
c79194	The words of the wise <i>are</i> as goads,
c79195	and as nails fastened <i>by</i> the masters of assemblies,
c79196	<i>which</i> are given from one shepherd.
c79198	And further, by these,
c79199	my son,
c79200	be admonished:
c79201	of making many books
c79202	<i>there is</i> no end;
c79203	and much study <i>is</i> a weariness of the flesh.
c79204	matter:
c79205	Let us hear the conclusion of the whole
c79206	Fear God,
c79207	and keep his commandments:
c79208	for this <i>is</i> the whole <i>duty</i> of man.
c79209	For God shall bring every work into judgment,
c79210	with every secret thing,
c79211	whether <i>it be</i> good,
c79212	or whether <i>it be</i> evil.
c79213	How doth the city sit solitary,
c79214	<i>that was</i> full of people!
c79215	<i>how</i> is she become as a widow! she <i>that was</i> great among the nations,
c79216	<i>and</i> princess among the provinces, <i>how</i> is she become tributary!
c79217	She weepeth sore in the night,
c79218	and her tears <i>are</i> on her cheeks:
c79219	among all her lovers she hath none to comfort
c79220	<i>her:</i> all her friends have dealt treacherously
c79221	with her, they are become her enemies.
c79222	Judah is gone into captivity because of affliction, and because of great servitude:
c79223	she dwelleth among the heathen,
c79224	she findeth no rest:
c79225	all her persecutors overtook her between the straits.
c79226	The ways of Zion do mourn, because none come to the solemn feasts:
c79227	all her gates are desolate:
c79228	her priests sigh,
c79229	her virgins are afflicted,
c79230	and she
c79231	<i>is</i> in bitterness.
c79232	Her adversaries are the chief,
c79233	her enemies prosper;
c79234	for the LORD hath afflicted her for the multitude of her transgressions:
c79235	her children are gone into captivity before the enemy.
c79236	And from the daughter of Zion all her beauty is departed:
c79237	her princes are become like harts
c79238	<i>that</i> find no pasture,
c79239	and they are gone without strength before the pursuer.
c79240	Jerusalem remembered in the days of her affliction and of her miseries all her pleasant things
c79241	that she had in the days of old,
c79242	when her people fell into the hand of the enemy,
c79243	and none did help
c79244	her: the adversaries saw
c79245	her, <i>and</i> did mock at her sabbaths.
c79246	Jerusalem hath grievously sinned;
c79247	therefore she is removed:
c79248	all that honoured her despise
c79249	her, because they have seen her nakedness:
c79250	yea, she sigheth,
c79251	and turneth backward.
c79252	Her filthiness <i>is</i> in her skirts;
c79253	she remembereth not her last end;
c79254	therefore she came down wonderfully:
c79255	she had no comforter.
c79256	behold
c79257	O LORD,
c79258	my affliction:
c79259	for the enemy hath magnified <i>himself.</i>
c79260	The adversary hath spread out his hand upon all her pleasant things:
c79261	for she hath seen
c79262	<i>that</i> the heathen entered into her sanctuary,
c79263	whom thou didst command
c79264	<i>that</i> they should not enter into thy congregation.
c79265	All her people sigh,
c79266	they seek bread;
c79267	they have given their pleasant things for meat
c79268	to relieve the soul:
c79269	see,
c79270	O LORD,
c79271	and consider;
c79272	for I am become vile.
c79273	<i>Is it</i> nothing to
c79274	you, all ye that pass by?
c79275	behold,
c79276	and see
c79277	if there be any sorrow like unto my sorrow,
c79278	which is done
c79279	unto me, wherewith the LORD hath afflicted <i>me</i> in the day of his fierce anger.
c79280	From above hath he sent fire into my bones,
c79281	and it prevaileth against
c79282	them: he hath spread a net for my feet,
c79283	he hath turned me back:
c79284	he hath made me desolate
c79285	<i>and</i> faint all the day.
c79286	The yoke of my transgressions is bound by his hand:
c79287	they are wreathed,
c79288	<i>and</i> come up upon my neck:
c79289	he hath made my strength to fall,
c79290	the Lord hath delivered me into <i>their</i> hands,
c79291	<i>from whom</i> I am not able
c79292	to rise up.
c79293	The Lord hath trodden under foot all my mighty <i>men</i> in the midst
c79294	of me: he hath called an assembly against
c79295	me to crush my young men:
c79296	the Lord hath trodden the virgin, the daughter of Judah, <i>as</i> in a winepress.
c79297	For these <i>things</i> I weep;
c79298	mine eye, mine eye runneth down with water,
c79299	because the comforter that should relieve my soul is far from
c79301	me: my children are desolate,
c79302	because the enemy prevailed.
c79303	Zion spreadeth forth her hands,
c79304	<i>and there is</i> none to comfort
c79305	her: the LORD hath commanded concerning Jacob, <i>that</i> his adversaries <i>should be</i> round about
c79306	him: Jerusalem is as a menstruous woman among them.
c79307	The LORD is righteous;
c79308	for I have rebelled against his commandment:
c79309	hear, I pray you,
c79310	all people,
c79311	and behold my sorrow:
c79312	my virgins and my young men are gone into captivity.
c79313	I called for my lovers,
c79314	<i>but</i> they deceived
c79315	me: my priests and mine elders gave up the ghost in the city,
c79316	while they sought their meat
c79317	to relieve their souls.
c79318	Behold,
c79319	O LORD;
c79320	for I <i>am</i> in distress:
c79321	my bowels are troubled;
c79322	mine heart is turned within
c79323	me; for I have grievously rebelled:
c79324	abroad the sword bereaveth,
c79325	at home <i>there is</i> as death.
c79326	They have heard
c79327	that I sigh:
c79328	<i>there is</i> none to comfort
c79329	me: all mine enemies have heard of my trouble;
c79330	they are glad
c79331	that thou hast done
c79332	<i>it:</i> thou wilt bring the day
c79333	<i>that</i> thou hast called,
c79334	and they shall be like unto me.
c79335	Let all their wickedness come before
c79336	thee; and do
c79337	unto them, as thou hast done unto me for all my transgressions:
c79338	for my sighs <i>are</i> many,
c79339	and my heart <i>is</i> faint.
c79340	How hath the Lord covered the daughter of Zion with a cloud in his anger,
c79341	<i>and</i> cast down from heaven unto the earth the beauty of Israel,
c79342	and remembered not his footstool in the day of his anger!
c79343	The Lord hath swallowed up
c79344	and hath not pitied:
c79345	all the habitations of Jacob,
c79346	he hath thrown down in his wrath the strong holds of the daughter of Judah;
c79347	he hath brought <i>them</i> down to the ground:
c79348	he hath polluted the kingdom and the princes thereof.
c79349	He hath cut off in <i>his</i> fierce anger all the horn of Israel:
c79350	he hath drawn back his right hand from before the enemy,
c79351	and he burned against Jacob like a flaming fire,
c79352	<i>which</i> devoureth round about.
c79353	He hath bent his bow like an enemy:
c79354	he stood with his right hand as an adversary,
c79355	and slew all <i>that were</i> pleasant to the eye
c79356	in the tabernacle of the daughter of Zion: he poured out his fury like fire.
c79357	The Lord was as an enemy:
c79358	he hath swallowed up Israel,
c79359	he hath swallowed up all her palaces:
c79360	he hath destroyed his strong holds,
c79361	and hath increased in the daughter of Judah mourning and lamentation.
c79362	And he hath violently taken away his tabernacle, as <i>if it were of</i> a garden:
c79363	he hath destroyed his places of the assembly:
c79364	the LORD hath caused the solemn feasts and sabbaths to be forgotten in Zion,
c79365	and hath despised in the indignation of his anger the king and the priest.
c79366	The Lord hath cast off his altar,
c79367	he hath abhorred his sanctuary,
c79368	he hath given up into the hand of the enemy the walls of her palaces;
c79369	they have made a noise in the house of the LORD, as in the day of a solemn feast.
c79370	The LORD hath purposed
c79371	to destroy the wall of the daughter of Zion:
c79372	he hath stretched out a line,
c79373	he hath not withdrawn his hand
c79374	from destroying:
c79375	therefore he made the rampart and the wall to lament;
c79376	they languished together.
c79377	Her gates are sunk into the ground;
c79378	he hath destroyed
c79379	and broken her bars:
c79380	her king and her princes <i>are</i> among the Gentiles:
c79381	the law <i>is</i> no
c79382	<i>more;</i> her prophets also find no vision from the LORD.
c79384	The elders of the daughter of Zion sit upon the ground, <i>and</i> keep silence:
c79385	they have cast up dust upon their heads;
c79386	they have girded themselves with sackcloth:
c79387	the virgins of Jerusalem hang down their heads to the ground.
c79388	Mine eyes do fail with tears,
c79389	my bowels are troubled,
c79390	my liver is poured upon the earth, for the destruction of the daughter of my people;
c79391	because the children and the sucklings swoon in the streets of the city.
c79392	They say to their mothers,
c79393	Where <i>is</i> corn and wine?
c79394	when they swooned as the wounded in the streets of the city,
c79395	when their soul was poured out into their mothers' bosom.
c79396	What thing shall I take to witness
c79397	for thee? what thing shall I liken
c79398	to thee, O daughter of Jerusalem?
c79399	what shall I equal
c79400	to thee, that I may comfort
c79401	thee, O virgin daughter of Zion?
c79402	for thy breach <i>is</i> great like the sea:
c79403	who can heal thee?
c79404	Thy prophets have seen vain and foolish things
c79405	for thee: and they have not discovered thine iniquity,
c79406	to turn away thy captivity;
c79407	but have seen for thee false burdens and causes of banishment.
c79408	All that pass by clap <i>their</i> hands at
c79409	thee; they hiss
c79410	and wag their head at the daughter of Jerusalem,
c79411	<i>saying, Is</i> this the city
c79412	that <i>men</i> call
c79413	The perfection of beauty,
c79414	The joy of the whole earth?
c79415	All thine enemies have opened their mouth against
c79416	thee: they hiss
c79417	and gnash the teeth:
c79418	they say,
c79419	We have swallowed <i>her</i> up:
c79420	certainly this <i>is</i> the day
c79421	that we looked for;
c79422	we have found,
c79423	we have seen <i>it.</i>
c79424	The LORD hath done
c79425	<i>that</i> which he had devised;
c79426	he hath fulfilled his word
c79427	that he had commanded in the days of old:
c79428	he hath thrown down,
c79429	and hath not pitied:
c79430	and he hath caused <i>thine</i> enemy to rejoice over
c79431	thee, he hath set up the horn of thine adversaries.
c79432	Their heart cried unto the Lord,
c79433	O wall of the daughter of Zion,
c79434	let tears run down like a river day and night:
c79435	give thyself no rest;
c79436	let not the apple of thine eye cease.
c79437	Arise,
c79438	cry out in the night: in the beginning of the watches
c79439	pour out thine heart like water before the face of the Lord:
c79440	lift up thy hands toward him for the life of thy young children,
c79441	that faint for hunger in the top of every street.
c79442	Behold,
c79443	O LORD,
c79444	and consider
c79445	to whom thou hast done this.
c79446	Shall the women eat their fruit, <i>and</i> children of a span long?
c79447	shall the priest and the prophet be slain in the sanctuary of the Lord?
c79448	The young and the old lie on the ground in the streets:
c79449	my virgins and my young men are fallen by the sword;
c79450	thou hast slain <i>them</i> in the day of thine anger;
c79451	thou hast killed,
c79452	<i>and</i> not pitied.
c79453	Thou hast called as in a solemn day my terrors round about,
c79454	so that in the day of the LORD'S anger none escaped nor remained:
c79455	those that I have swaddled
c79456	and brought up
c79457	hath mine enemy consumed.
c79458	I <i>am</i> the man
c79459	<i>that</i> hath seen affliction by the rod of his wrath.
c79460	He hath led
c79461	me, and brought <i>me into</i> darkness, but not <i>into</i> light.
c79462	Surely against me is he turned;
c79463	he turneth his hand <i>against me</i> all the day.
c79464	My flesh and my skin hath he made old;
c79465	he hath broken my bones.
c79466	He hath builded against
c79467	me, and compassed <i>me</i> with gall and travail.
c79468	He hath set me in dark places, as <i>they that be</i> dead of old.
c79469	He hath hedged me about,
c79470	that I cannot get out:
c79471	he hath made my chain heavy.
c79472	Also when I cry
c79473	and shout,
c79474	he shutteth out my prayer.
c79475	He hath inclosed my ways with hewn stone,
c79476	he hath made my paths crooked.
c79477	He <i>was</i> unto me <i>as</i> a bear lying in wait,
c79478	<i>and as</i> a lion in secret places.
c79479	He hath turned aside my ways,
c79480	and pulled me in pieces:
c79481	he hath made me desolate.
c79482	He hath bent his bow,
c79483	and set me as a mark for the arrow.
c79484	He hath caused the arrows of his quiver to enter into my reins.
c79485	I was a derision to all my people;
c79486	<i>and</i> their song all the day.
c79487	He hath filled me with bitterness,
c79488	he hath made me drunken with wormwood.
c79489	He hath also broken my teeth with gravel stones,
c79490	he hath covered me with ashes.
c79491	And thou hast removed my soul far off from peace:
c79492	I forgat prosperity.
c79493	And I said,
c79494	My strength and my hope is perished
c79495	from the LORD:
c79496	Remembering mine affliction and my misery, the wormwood and the gall.
c79498	My soul hath <i>them</i> still in remembrance, and is humbled in me.
c79499	This I recall to my mind,
c79500	therefore have I hope.
c79501	<i>It is of</i> the LORD'S mercies
c79502	that we are not consumed,
c79503	because his compassions fail not.
c79504	<i>They are</i> new every morning:
c79505	great <i>is</i> thy faithfulness.
c79506	The LORD <i>is</i> my portion,
c79507	saith my soul;
c79508	therefore will I hope in him.
c79509	The LORD <i>is</i> good unto them that wait for
c79510	him, to the soul
c79511	<i>that</i> seeketh him.
c79512	<i>It is</i> good that <i>a man</i> should both hope and quietly wait for the salvation of the LORD.
c79513	<i>It is</i> good for a man
c79514	that he bear the yoke in his youth.
c79515	He sitteth alone
c79516	and keepeth silence,
c79517	because he hath borne <i>it</i> upon him.
c79518	He putteth his mouth in the dust;
c79519	if so be there may be hope.
c79520	He giveth <i>his</i> cheek to him that smiteth
c79521	him: he is filled full with reproach.
c79522	For the Lord will not cast off for ever:
c79523	But though he cause grief,
c79524	yet will he have compassion according to the multitude of his mercies.
c79525	For he doth not afflict willingly
c79526	nor grieve the children of men.
c79527	To crush under his feet all the prisoners of the earth,
c79528	To turn aside the right of a man before the face of the most High,
c79529	To subvert a man in his cause,
c79530	the Lord approveth not.
c79531	Who <i>is</i> he <i>that</i> saith,
c79532	and it cometh to pass,
c79533	<i>when</i> the Lord commandeth <i>it</i> not?
c79534	Out of the mouth of the most High proceedeth not evil and good?
c79535	Wherefore doth a living man complain,
c79536	a man for the punishment of his sins?
c79537	Let us search and try our ways,
c79539	and turn again to the LORD.
c79540	Let us lift up our heart with <i>our</i> hands unto God in the heavens.
c79541	We have transgressed
c79542	and have rebelled:
c79543	thou hast not pardoned.
c79544	Thou hast covered with anger,
c79545	and persecuted
c79546	us: thou hast slain,
c79547	thou hast not pitied.
c79548	Thou hast covered thyself with a cloud,
c79549	that <i>our</i> prayer should not pass through.
c79550	Thou hast made us <i>as</i> the offscouring and refuse in the midst of the people.
c79551	All our enemies have opened their mouths against us.
c79552	Fear and a snare is come
c79553	upon us, desolation and destruction.
c79554	Mine eye runneth down with rivers of water for the destruction of the daughter of my people.
c79555	Mine eye trickleth down,
c79556	and ceaseth not,
c79557	without any intermission,
c79558	Till the LORD look down,
c79559	and behold from heaven.
c79560	Mine eye affecteth mine heart because of all the daughters of my city.
c79561	Mine enemies chased me sore, like a bird, without cause.
c79562	They have cut off my life in the dungeon,
c79563	and cast a stone upon me.
c79564	Waters flowed over mine head;
c79565	<i>then</i> I said,
c79566	I am cut off.
c79567	I called upon thy name,
c79568	O LORD,
c79569	out of the low dungeon.
c79570	Thou hast heard my voice:
c79571	hide not thine ear at my breathing, at my cry.
c79572	Thou drewest near in the day
c79573	<i>that</i> I called upon
c79574	thee: thou saidst,
c79575	Fear not.
c79576	thou hast pleaded
c79577	O Lord,
c79578	the causes of my soul;
c79579	thou hast redeemed my life.
c79580	thou hast seen
c79581	O LORD,
c79582	my wrong:
c79583	judge thou my cause.
c79584	Thou hast seen all their vengeance
c79585	<i>and</i> all their imaginations against me.
c79586	Thou hast heard their reproach,
c79587	O LORD,
c79588	<i>and</i> all their imaginations against me;
c79589	The lips of those that rose up against me, and their device against me all the day.
c79590	Behold their sitting down, and their rising up;
c79591	I <i>am</i> their musick.
c79592	Render unto them a recompence,
c79593	O LORD,
c79594	according to the work of their hands.
c79595	Give them sorrow of heart,
c79596	thy curse unto them.
c79597	Persecute and destroy them in anger
c79598	from under the heavens of the LORD.
c79599	How is the gold become dim!
c79600	<i>how</i> is the most fine gold changed!
c79601	the stones of the sanctuary are poured out in the top of every street.
c79602	The precious sons of Zion,
c79603	comparable to fine gold,
c79604	how are they esteemed as earthen pitchers, the work of the hands of the potter!
c79605	Even the sea monsters draw out the breast,
c79606	they give suck to their young ones:
c79607	the daughter of my people <i>is become</i> cruel, like the ostriches in the wilderness.
c79608	The tongue of the sucking child cleaveth to the roof of his mouth for thirst:
c79609	the young children ask bread,
c79610	<i>and</i> no man breaketh <i>it</i> unto them.
c79611	They that did feed delicately
c79612	are desolate in the streets:
c79613	they that were brought up in scarlet
c79614	embrace dunghills.
c79615	For the punishment of the iniquity of the daughter of my people is greater than the punishment of the sin of Sodom,
c79616	that was overthrown as in a moment,
c79617	and no hands stayed on her.
c79618	Her Nazarites were purer than snow,
c79619	they were whiter than milk,
c79620	they were more ruddy in body than rubies,
c79621	their polishing <i>was</i> of sapphire:
c79622	Their visage is blacker than a coal;
c79623	they are not known in the streets:
c79624	their skin cleaveth to their bones;
c79625	it is withered, it is become like a stick.
c79626	<i>They that be</i> slain with the sword are better than <i>they that be</i> slain with hunger:
c79627	for these pine away,
c79628	stricken through for <i>want of</i> the fruits of the field.
c79629	The hands of the pitiful women have sodden their own children:
c79630	they were their meat in the destruction of the daughter of my people.
c79631	The LORD hath accomplished his fury;
c79632	he hath poured out his fierce anger,
c79633	and hath kindled a fire in Zion,
c79634	and it hath devoured the foundations thereof.
c79635	The kings of the earth, and all the inhabitants of the world, would not have believed
c79636	that the adversary and the enemy should have entered into the gates of Jerusalem.
c79637	For the sins of her prophets, <i>and</i> the iniquities of her priests,
c79638	that have shed the blood of the just in the midst of her,
c79639	They have wandered <i>as</i> blind <i>men</i> in the streets,
c79640	they have polluted themselves with blood,
c79641	so that men could not
c79642	touch their garments.
c79643	unto them, Depart
c79644	ye; <i>it is</i> unclean;
c79645	They cried
c79646	depart,
c79647	depart,
c79648	touch not:
c79649	when they fled away
c79650	and wandered,
c79651	they said among the heathen,
c79652	They shall no more
c79653	sojourn <i>there.</i>
c79654	The anger of the LORD hath divided
c79655	them; he will no more
c79656	regard
c79657	them: they respected not the persons of the priests,
c79658	they favoured not the elders.
c79660	As for us, our eyes as yet failed for our vain help:
c79661	in our watching we have watched for a nation
c79662	<i>that</i> could not save <i>us.</i>
c79663	They hunt our steps,
c79664	that we cannot go in our streets:
c79665	our end is near,
c79666	our days are fulfilled;
c79667	for our end is come.
c79668	Our persecutors are swifter than the eagles of the heaven:
c79669	they pursued us upon the mountains,
c79670	they laid wait for us in the wilderness.
c79671	The breath of our nostrils, the anointed of the LORD, was taken in their pits,
c79672	of whom we said,
c79673	Under his shadow we shall live among the heathen.
c79674	Rejoice
c79675	and be glad,
c79676	O daughter of Edom,
c79677	that dwellest in the land of Uz;
c79678	the cup also shall pass through unto
c79679	thee: thou shalt be drunken,
c79680	and shalt make thyself naked.
c79681	The punishment of thine iniquity is accomplished,
c79682	O daughter of Zion;
c79683	he will no more
c79684	carry thee away into captivity:
c79685	he will visit thine iniquity,
c79686	O daughter of Edom;
c79687	he will discover thy sins.
c79688	Remember,
c79689	O LORD,
c79690	what is come
c79691	upon us: consider,
c79692	and behold our reproach.
c79693	Our inheritance is turned to strangers,
c79694	our houses to aliens.
c79695	We are orphans
c79696	and fatherless,
c79697	our mothers <i>are</i> as widows.
c79698	We have drunken our water for money;
c79699	our wood is sold unto us.
c79700	Our necks <i>are</i> under persecution:
c79701	we labour,
c79702	<i>and</i> have no rest.
c79703	We have given the hand <i>to</i> the Egyptians,
c79704	<i>and to</i> the Assyrians,
c79705	to be satisfied with bread.
c79706	Our fathers have sinned,
c79707	<i>and are</i> not;
c79708	and we have borne their iniquities.
c79709	Servants have ruled over
c79710	us: <i>there is</i> none that doth deliver <i>us</i> out of their hand.
c79711	We gat our bread with <i>the peril of</i> our lives because of the sword of the wilderness.
c79712	Our skin was black like an oven because of the terrible famine.
c79713	They ravished the women in Zion,
c79714	<i>and</i> the maids in the cities of Judah.
c79715	Princes are hanged up by their hand:
c79716	the faces of elders were not honoured.
c79717	They took the young men to grind,
c79718	and the children fell under the wood.
c79719	The elders have ceased from the gate,
c79720	the young men from their musick.
c79721	The joy of our heart is ceased;
c79722	our dance is turned into mourning.
c79723	The crown is fallen <i>from</i> our head:
c79724	woe
c79725	unto us, that we have sinned!
c79726	For this our heart is faint;
c79727	for these <i>things</i> our eyes are dim.
c79728	Because of the mountain of Zion,
c79729	which is desolate,
c79730	the foxes walk upon it.
c79731	Thou, O LORD, remainest for ever;
c79732	thy throne from generation to generation.
c79733	Wherefore dost thou forget us for ever,
c79734	<i>and</i> forsake us so long time?
c79735	Turn
c79736	thee, O LORD,
c79737	thou us unto
c79738	and we shall be turned;
c79739	renew our days as of old.
c79740	But thou hast utterly rejected
c79741	us; thou art very wroth against us.
c79742	Now it came to pass in the days of Ahasuerus,
c79743	(this <i>is</i> Ahasuerus
c79744	which reigned, from India even unto Ethiopia, <i>over</i> an hundred and seven and twenty provinces:)
c79745	<i>That</i> in those days,
c79746	when the king Ahasuerus sat on the throne of his kingdom,
c79747	which <i>was</i> in Shushan the palace,
c79748	In the third year
c79749	of his reign,
c79750	he made a feast unto all his princes and his servants; the power of Persia and Media, the nobles and princes of the provinces, <i>being</i> before him:
c79751	When he shewed the riches of his glorious kingdom and the honour of his excellent majesty many days, <i>even</i> an hundred and fourscore days.
c79753	And when these days were expired,
c79754	the king made a feast unto all the people
c79755	that were present in Shushan the palace,
c79756	both unto great and small, seven days, in the court of the garden of the king's palace;
c79757	<i>Where were</i> white, green, and blue, <i>hangings,</i> fastened with cords of fine linen and purple to silver rings and pillars of marble:
c79758	the beds <i>were of</i> gold and silver, upon a pavement of red, and blue, and white, and black, marble.
c79759	And they gave <i>them</i> drink in vessels of gold,
c79760	(the vessels being diverse one from another,)
c79761	and royal wine in abundance, according to the state of the king.
c79762	And the drinking <i>was</i> according to the law;
c79763	none did compel:
c79764	for so the king had appointed to all the officers of his house,
c79765	that they should do according to every man's pleasure.
c79766	Also Vashti the queen made a feast for the women <i>in</i> the royal house
c79767	which <i>belonged</i> to king Ahasuerus.
c79768	On the seventh day,
c79769	when the heart of the king was merry with wine,
c79770	he commanded Mehuman, Biztha, Harbona, Bigtha, and Abagtha, Zethar, and Carcas, the seven chamberlains
c79771	that served in the presence of Ahasuerus the king,
c79772	To bring Vashti the queen before the king with the crown royal,
c79773	to shew the people and the princes her beauty:
c79774	for she <i>was</i> fair to look on.
c79775	But the queen Vashti refused
c79776	to come at the king's commandment
c79777	by <i>his</i> chamberlains:
c79778	therefore was the king very wroth,
c79779	and his anger burned in him.
c79780	Then the king said to the wise men, which knew the times,
c79781	(for so <i>was</i> the king's manner toward all that knew law and judgment:
c79783	And the next unto
c79784	him <i>was</i> Carshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish, Meres, Marsena, <i>and</i> Memucan, the seven princes of Persia and Media, which saw the king's face,
c79785	<i>and</i> which sat the first in the kingdom;)
c79786	What shall we do unto the queen Vashti according to law,
c79788	because she hath not performed the commandment of the king Ahasuerus by the chamberlains?
c79789	And Memucan answered before the king and the princes,
c79790	Vashti the queen hath not done wrong to the king only,
c79791	but also to all the princes, and to all the people
c79792	that <i>are</i> in all the provinces of the king Ahasuerus.
c79793	For <i>this</i> deed of the queen shall come abroad unto all women,
c79794	so that they shall despise their husbands in their eyes,
c79795	when it shall be reported,
c79796	The king Ahasuerus commanded
c79797	Vashti the queen to be brought in before
c79798	him, but she came not.
c79799	<i>Likewise</i> shall the ladies of Persia and Media say this day
c79800	which have heard of the deed of the queen.
c79801	unto all the king's princes,
c79802	Thus <i>shall there arise</i> too much contempt and wrath.
c79803	If it please the king,
c79804	let there go a royal commandment from
c79805	him, and let it be written among the laws of the Persians and the Medes,
c79806	that it be not altered,
c79807	That Vashti come no more before king Ahasuerus;
c79808	and let the king give her royal estate unto another
c79809	that is better than she.
c79810	And when the king's decree which he shall make shall be published
c79812	throughout all his empire,
c79813	(for it is great,)
c79814	all the wives shall give to their husbands honour, both to great and small.
c79815	And the saying pleased the king and the princes;
c79816	and the king did according to the word of Memucan:
c79817	For he sent letters into all the king's provinces,
c79818	into every province according to the writing
c79819	thereof, and to every people after their language,
c79820	that every man should
c79821	bear rule in his own house,
c79822	and that <i>it</i> should be published according to the language of every people.
c79823	After these things,
c79824	when the wrath of king Ahasuerus was appeased,
c79825	he remembered Vashti,
c79826	and what she had done,
c79827	and what was decreed against her.
c79828	Then said the king's servants that ministered
c79829	unto him, Let there be fair young virgins sought for the king:
c79830	And let the king appoint officers in all the provinces of his kingdom,
c79831	that they may gather together all the fair young virgins unto Shushan the palace, to the house of the women, unto the custody of Hege the king's chamberlain, keeper of the women;
c79832	and let their things for purification be given <i>them:</i>
c79833	And let the maiden
c79834	which pleaseth the king
c79835	be queen instead of Vashti.
c79836	And the thing pleased the king;
c79837	and he did so.
c79838	<i>Now</i> in Shushan the palace there was a certain Jew,
c79839	whose name <i>was</i> Mordecai, the son of Jair, the son of Shimei, the son of Kish,
c79840	a Benjamite;
c79841	Who had been carried away from Jerusalem with the captivity
c79842	which had been carried away with Jeconiah king of Judah,
c79843	whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away.
c79844	And he brought up Hadassah,
c79845	that <i>is,</i> Esther,
c79846	his uncle's daughter:
c79847	for she had neither father nor mother,
c79848	and the maid <i>was</i> fair and beautiful;
c79849	whom Mordecai, when her father and mother were dead, took for his own daughter.
c79850	So it came to pass,
c79851	when the king's commandment and his decree was heard,
c79852	and when many maidens were gathered together unto Shushan the palace, to the custody of Hegai,
c79853	that Esther was brought also unto the king's house, to the custody of Hegai, keeper of the women.
c79854	And the maiden pleased
c79855	him, and she obtained kindness of
c79856	him; and he speedily gave her her things for purification, with such things as belonged
c79858	to her, and seven maidens, <i>which were</i> meet
c79859	to be given her, out of the king's house:
c79860	and he preferred her and her maids unto the best <i>place</i> of the house of the women.
c79861	Esther had not shewed her people nor her kindred:
c79862	for Mordecai had charged her
c79863	that she should not shew <i>it.</i>
c79864	And Mordecai walked every day before the court of the women's house,
c79865	to know how Esther did,
c79866	and what should become of her.
c79867	Now when every maid's turn was come
c79868	to go in to king Ahasuerus,
c79869	after that
c79870	she had been twelve months, according to the manner of the women,
c79871	(for so were the days of their purifications accomplished,
c79872	<i>to wit,</i> six months with oil of myrrh,
c79873	and six months with sweet odours, and with <i>other</i> things for the purifying of the women;)
c79874	Then thus came <i>every</i> maiden unto the king;
c79875	whatsoever
c79876	she desired
c79877	was given
c79878	her to go with her out of the house of the women unto the king's house.
c79879	In the evening she went,
c79880	and on the morrow she returned into the second house of the women, to the custody of Shaashgaz, the king's chamberlain, which kept the concubines:
c79881	she came in unto the king no more,
c79882	except the king delighted
c79883	in her, and that she were called by name.
c79885	Now when the turn of Esther, the daughter of Abihail the uncle of Mordecai, who had taken her for his daughter, was come
c79887	to go in unto the king,
c79888	she required nothing
c79889	but
c79890	what Hegai the king's chamberlain, the keeper of the women, appointed.
c79891	And Esther obtained favour in the sight of all them that looked upon her.
c79892	So Esther was taken unto king Ahasuerus into his house royal in the tenth month,
c79893	which <i>is</i> the month Tebeth,
c79894	in the seventh year of his reign.
c79895	And the king loved Esther above all the women,
c79896	and she obtained grace and favour in his sight more than all the virgins;
c79897	so that he set the royal crown upon her head,
c79898	and made her queen instead of Vashti.
c79899	Then the king made a great feast unto all his princes and his servants, <i>even</i> Esther's feast;
c79900	and he made a release to the provinces,
c79901	and gave gifts, according to the state of the king.
c79902	And when the virgins were gathered together the second time,
c79903	then Mordecai sat in the king's gate.
c79904	Esther had not <i>yet</i> shewed her kindred nor her people;
c79905	as Mordecai had charged her:
c79906	for Esther did the commandment of Mordecai,
c79907	like as when she was brought up with him.
c79908	In those days,
c79909	while Mordecai sat in the king's gate,
c79910	two of the king's chamberlains, Bigthan and Teresh, of those which kept the door, were wroth,
c79911	and sought
c79912	to lay hand on the king Ahasuerus.
c79913	And the thing was known to Mordecai,
c79914	who told <i>it</i> unto Esther the queen;
c79915	and Esther certified the king <i>thereof</i> in Mordecai's name.
c79916	And when inquisition was made of the matter,
c79917	it was found out;
c79918	therefore they were both hanged on a tree:
c79919	and it was written in the book of the chronicles before the king.
c79920	After these things did king Ahasuerus promote Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite,
c79921	and advanced
c79922	him, and set his seat above all the princes
c79923	that <i>were</i> with him.
c79924	And all the king's servants,
c79925	that <i>were</i> in the king's gate,
c79926	bowed,
c79927	and reverenced Haman:
c79928	for the king had so commanded
c79929	concerning him. But Mordecai bowed not,
c79930	nor did <i>him</i> reverence.
c79931	Then the king's servants, which <i>were</i> in the king's gate, said
c79933	unto Mordecai,
c79934	Why transgressest thou the king's commandment?
c79935	Now it came to pass,
c79936	when they spake daily unto
c79937	him, and he hearkened not unto
c79938	them, that they told Haman,
c79939	to see
c79940	whether Mordecai's matters would stand:
c79941	for he had told
c79942	them that he <i>was</i> a Jew.
c79943	And when Haman saw
c79944	that Mordecai bowed not,
c79945	nor did him reverence,
c79946	then was Haman full of wrath.
c79947	And he thought scorn
c79948	to lay hands on Mordecai alone;
c79949	for they had shewed him the people of Mordecai:
c79950	wherefore Haman sought
c79951	to destroy all the Jews
c79952	that <i>were</i> throughout the whole kingdom of Ahasuerus,
c79953	<i>even</i> the people of Mordecai.
c79954	In the first month,
c79955	that <i>is,</i> the month Nisan,
c79956	in the twelfth year of king Ahasuerus, they cast Pur,
c79957	that <i>is,</i> the lot,
c79958	before Haman from day to day, and from month to month, <i>to</i> the twelfth
c79959	<i>month,</i> that <i>is,</i> the month Adar.
c79960	And Haman said unto king Ahasuerus,
c79961	There is
c79962	a certain people scattered abroad
c79963	and dispersed among the people in all the provinces of thy kingdom;
c79964	and their laws <i>are</i> diverse from all people;
c79965	neither keep they the king's laws:
c79966	therefore it <i>is</i> not for the king's profit
c79967	to suffer them.
c79968	If it please the king,
c79969	let it be written
c79970	that they may be destroyed:
c79971	and I will pay ten thousand talents of silver to the hands of those that have the charge of the business,
c79972	to bring <i>it</i> into the king's treasuries.
c79973	And the king took his ring from his hand,
c79974	and gave it unto Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite,
c79975	the Jews' enemy.
c79976	And the king said unto Haman,
c79977	The silver <i>is</i> given
c79978	to thee, the people
c79979	also, to do with them as it seemeth good to thee.
c79980	Then were the king's scribes called on the thirteenth day of the first month,
c79981	and there was written according to all
c79982	that Haman had commanded
c79983	unto the king's lieutenants, and to the governors
c79984	that <i>were</i> over every province,
c79985	and to the rulers of every people
c79986	of every province according to the writing
c79987	thereof, and <i>to</i> every people after their language;
c79988	in the name of king Ahasuerus was it written,
c79989	and sealed with the king's ring.
c79990	And the letters were sent by posts into all the king's provinces,
c79991	to destroy,
c79992	to kill,
c79993	and to cause to perish, all Jews, both young and old, little children and women, in one day, <i>even</i> upon the thirteenth <i>day</i> of the twelfth month,
c79994	which is the month Adar,
c79995	and <i>to take</i> the spoil of them for a prey.
c79996	The copy of the writing
c79997	for a commandment to be given in every province
c79998	was published unto all people,
c79999	that they should be ready against that day.
c80000	The posts went out,
c80001	being hastened by the king's commandment,
c80002	and the decree was given in Shushan the palace.
c80003	And the king and Haman sat down
c80004	to drink;
c80005	but the city Shushan was perplexed.
c80006	When Mordecai perceived all
c80007	that was done,
c80008	Mordecai rent his clothes,
c80009	and put on sackcloth with ashes,
c80010	and went out into the midst of the city,
c80011	and cried with a loud and a bitter cry;
c80012	And came even before the king's gate:
c80013	for none
c80014	<i>might</i> enter into the king's gate clothed with sackcloth.
c80015	And in every province, whithersoever
c80016	the king's commandment and his decree came,
c80017	<i>there was</i> great mourning among the Jews,
c80018	and fasting, and weeping, and wailing;
c80019	and many lay in sackcloth and ashes.
c80020	So Esther's maids and her chamberlains came
c80021	and told
c80022	<i>it</i> her. Then was the queen exceedingly grieved;
c80023	and she sent raiment
c80024	to clothe Mordecai,
c80025	and to take away his sackcloth from
c80026	him: but he received <i>it</i> not.
c80027	Then called Esther for Hatach, <i>one</i> of the king's chamberlains,
c80028	whom he had appointed to attend upon
c80029	her, and gave him a commandment to Mordecai,
c80030	to know
c80031	what it
c80032	<i>was,</i> and why it <i>was.</i>
c80033	So Hatach went forth to Mordecai unto the street of the city,
c80034	which <i>was</i> before the king's gate.
c80035	And Mordecai told him of all
c80036	that had happened
c80037	unto him, and of the sum of the money
c80038	that Haman had promised
c80039	to pay to the king's treasuries for the Jews,
c80040	to destroy them.
c80042	Also he gave him the copy of the writing of the decree that was given at Shushan
c80043	to destroy
c80045	them, to shew <i>it</i> unto Esther,
c80046	and to declare
c80047	<i>it</i> unto her, and to charge her
c80048	that she should go in unto the king,
c80049	to make supplication
c80050	unto him, and to make request before him for her people.
c80051	And Hatach came
c80052	and told Esther the words of Mordecai.
c80053	Again Esther spake unto Hatach,
c80054	and gave him commandment unto Mordecai;
c80055	All the king's servants, and the people of the king's provinces, do know,
c80056	that whosoever, whether man or woman,
c80057	shall come unto the king into the inner court,
c80059	<i>there is</i> one law
c80060	of his to put <i>him</i> to death,
c80061	except such to whom the king shall hold out the golden sceptre,
c80062	who is not called,
c80063	that he may live:
c80064	but I have not been called
c80065	to come in unto the king
c80066	these thirty days.
c80067	And they told to Mordecai Esther's words.
c80068	Then Mordecai commanded
c80069	to answer Esther,
c80070	Think not with thyself
c80071	that thou shalt escape in the king's house, more than all the Jews.
c80072	For
c80073	if thou altogether holdest thy peace at this time,
c80074	<i>then</i> shall there enlargement and deliverance arise to the Jews from another place;
c80075	but thou and thy father's house shall be destroyed:
c80076	and who knoweth
c80077	whether thou art come to the kingdom for <i>such</i> a time as this?
c80078	Then Esther bade
c80079	<i>them</i> return Mordecai <i>this answer,</i>
c80080	Go,
c80081	gather together all the Jews
c80082	that are present in Shushan,
c80083	and fast ye for
c80084	me, and neither eat
c80085	nor drink three days, night or day:
c80086	I also and my maidens will fast likewise;
c80087	and so will I go in unto the king,
c80088	which <i>is</i> not according to the law:
c80090	and if I perish,
c80091	I perish.
c80092	So Mordecai went his way,
c80093	and did according to all
c80094	that Esther had commanded him.
c80095	Now it came to pass on the third day,
c80096	that Esther put on <i>her</i> royal
c80097	<i>apparel,</i> and stood in the inner court of the king's house, over against the king's house:
c80098	and the king sat upon his royal throne in the royal house, over against the gate of the house.
c80099	And it was
c80100	so, when the king saw Esther the queen
c80101	standing in the court,
c80102	<i>that</i> she obtained favour in his sight:
c80103	and the king held out to Esther the golden sceptre
c80104	that <i>was</i> in his hand.
c80105	So Esther drew near,
c80106	and touched the top of the sceptre.
c80107	Then said the king
c80108	unto her, What
c80109	wilt thou, queen Esther?
c80110	and what <i>is</i> thy request?
c80111	thee to the half of the kingdom.
c80112	it shall be even given
c80113	And Esther answered,
c80114	If <i>it seem</i> good unto the king,
c80115	let the king and Haman come this day unto the banquet
c80116	that I have prepared for him.
c80117	Then the king said,
c80118	Cause Haman to make haste,
c80119	that he may do as Esther hath said.
c80120	So the king and Haman came to the banquet
c80121	that Esther had prepared.
c80122	And the king said unto Esther at the banquet of wine,
c80123	What <i>is</i> thy petition?
c80124	and it shall be granted
c80125	thee: and what <i>is</i> thy request?
c80126	even to the half of the kingdom
c80127	it shall be performed.
c80128	Then answered Esther,
c80129	and said,
c80130	My petition and my request <i>is;</i>
c80131	If I have found favour in the sight of the king,
c80132	and if it please the king
c80133	to grant my petition,
c80134	and to perform my request,
c80135	let the king and Haman come to the banquet
c80136	that I shall prepare
c80137	for them, and I will do to morrow as the king hath said.
c80138	Then went Haman forth that day joyful and with a glad heart:
c80139	but when Haman saw Mordecai in the king's gate,
c80140	that he stood not up,
c80141	nor moved for him,
c80142	he was full of indignation against Mordecai.
c80143	Nevertheless Haman refrained himself:
c80144	and when he came home,
c80145	he sent
c80146	and called for his friends, and Zeresh his wife.
c80147	And Haman told them of the glory of his riches, and the multitude of his children, and all
c80148	<i>the things</i> wherein the king had promoted
c80149	him, and how he had advanced him above the princes and servants of the king.
c80150	Haman said
c80151	moreover, Yea, Esther the queen did let no man come in with the king unto the banquet
c80152	that she had prepared
c80153	but
c80154	myself; and to morrow am I invited unto her also with the king.
c80155	Yet all this
c80156	availeth me nothing, so long
c80157	as I see Mordecai the Jew
c80158	sitting at the king's gate.
c80159	Then said Zeresh his wife and all his friends
c80160	unto him, Let a gallows be made of fifty cubits high,
c80161	and to morrow speak thou unto the king
c80162	that Mordecai may be hanged thereon:
c80163	then go thou in merrily with the king unto the banquet.
c80164	And the thing pleased Haman;
c80165	and he caused the gallows to be made.
c80166	On that night could not the king sleep,
c80167	and he commanded
c80168	to bring the book of records of the chronicles;
c80169	and they were read before the king.
c80170	And it was found written,
c80171	that Mordecai had told of Bigthana and Teresh, two of the king's chamberlains, the keepers of the door,
c80172	who sought
c80173	to lay hand on the king Ahasuerus.
c80174	And the king said,
c80175	What honour and dignity hath been done to Mordecai for this?
c80176	Then said the king's servants that ministered
c80177	unto him, There is nothing done for him.
c80178	And the king said,
c80179	Who <i>is</i> in the court?
c80180	Now Haman was come into the outward court of the king's house,
c80181	to speak unto the king
c80182	to hang Mordecai on the gallows
c80183	that he had prepared for him.
c80184	And the king's servants said unto
c80185	him, Behold, Haman standeth in the court.
c80186	And the king said,
c80187	Let him come in.
c80188	So Haman came in.
c80189	And the king said
c80190	unto him, What
c80191	shall be done unto the man
c80192	whom the king delighteth to honour?
c80193	Now Haman thought in his heart,
c80194	To whom would the king delight
c80195	to do honour
c80196	more than to myself?
c80197	And Haman answered the king,
c80198	For the man
c80199	whom the king delighteth to honour,
c80200	Let the royal apparel be brought
c80201	which the king <i>useth</i> to wear,
c80202	and the horse
c80203	that the king rideth upon,
c80204	and the crown royal which is set upon his head:
c80205	And let this apparel and horse be delivered to the hand of one of the king's most noble princes,
c80206	that they may array the man
c80207	<i>withal</i> whom the king delighteth to honour,
c80208	and bring him on horseback through the street of the city,
c80209	and proclaim before
c80210	him, Thus shall it be done to the man
c80211	whom the king delighteth to honour.
c80212	Then the king said to Haman,
c80213	Make haste,
c80214	<i>and</i> take the apparel and the horse,
c80215	as thou hast said,
c80216	and do even so to Mordecai the Jew,
c80217	that sitteth at the king's gate:
c80218	let nothing fail of all
c80219	that thou hast spoken.
c80220	Then took Haman the apparel and the horse,
c80221	and arrayed Mordecai,
c80222	and brought him on horseback through the street of the city,
c80223	and proclaimed before
c80224	him, Thus shall it be done unto the man
c80225	whom the king delighteth to honour.
c80226	And Mordecai came again to the king's gate.
c80227	But Haman hasted to his house mourning, and having his head covered.
c80228	And Haman told Zeresh his wife and all his friends every
c80229	<i>thing</i> that had befallen
c80230	him. Then said his wise men and Zeresh his wife
c80231	unto him, If Mordecai <i>be</i> of the seed of the Jews,
c80233	before whom thou hast begun to fall,
c80234	thou shalt not prevail
c80235	against him, but shalt surely fall before him.
c80236	And while they <i>were</i> yet talking with
c80237	him, came the king's chamberlains,
c80238	and hasted
c80239	to bring Haman unto the banquet
c80240	that Esther had prepared.
c80241	So the king and Haman came
c80242	to banquet with Esther the queen.
c80243	And the king said again unto Esther on the second day at the banquet of wine,
c80244	What <i>is</i> thy petition,
c80245	queen Esther?
c80246	and it shall be granted
c80247	thee: and what <i>is</i> thy request?
c80248	<i>even</i> to the half of the kingdom.
c80249	and it shall be performed,
c80250	Then Esther the queen answered
c80251	and said,
c80252	If I have found favour in thy sight,
c80253	O king,
c80254	and if it please the king,
c80255	let my life be given me at my petition,
c80256	and my people at my request:
c80257	For we are sold, I and my people,
c80258	to be destroyed,
c80259	to be slain,
c80260	and to perish.
c80262	But if we had been sold for bondmen and bondwomen,
c80263	I had held my tongue,
c80264	although the enemy could not countervail the king's damage.
c80265	Then the king Ahasuerus answered
c80266	and said unto Esther the queen,
c80267	Who is he,
c80268	and where is he,
c80269	that durst presume in his heart
c80270	to do so?
c80271	And Esther said,
c80272	The adversary and enemy
c80273	<i>is</i> this wicked Haman.
c80274	Then Haman was afraid before the king and the queen.
c80275	And the king arising from the banquet of wine in his wrath <i>went</i> into the palace garden:
c80276	and Haman stood up
c80277	to make request for his life to Esther the queen;
c80278	for he saw
c80279	that there was evil determined against him by the king.
c80280	Then the king returned out of the palace garden into the place of the banquet of wine;
c80281	and Haman was fallen upon the bed
c80282	whereon Esther
c80283	<i>was.</i> Then said the king,
c80284	Will he force the queen also before me in the house?
c80285	As the word went out of the king's mouth,
c80286	they covered Haman's face.
c80287	And Harbonah, one of the chamberlains, said before the king,
c80288	Behold also, the gallows
c80289	which Haman had made for Mordecai,
c80290	who had spoken good for the king,
c80291	standeth in the house of Haman.
c80292	fifty cubits high,
c80293	Then the king said,
c80294	Hang him thereon.
c80295	So they hanged Haman on the gallows
c80296	that he had prepared for Mordecai.
c80297	Then was the king's wrath pacified.
c80298	On that day did the king Ahasuerus give the house of Haman the Jews' enemy unto Esther the queen.
c80299	And Mordecai came before the king;
c80300	for Esther had told
c80301	what he <i>was</i> unto her.
c80302	And the king took off his ring,
c80303	which he had taken from Haman,
c80304	and gave it unto Mordecai.
c80305	And Esther set Mordecai over the house of Haman.
c80306	And Esther spake yet again
c80307	before the king,
c80308	and fell down at his feet,
c80309	him with tears
c80310	and besought
c80311	to put away the mischief of Haman the Agagite, and his device
c80312	that he had devised against the Jews.
c80313	Then the king held out the golden sceptre toward Esther.
c80314	So Esther arose,
c80315	and stood before the king,
c80316	And said,
c80317	If it please the king,
c80318	and if I have found favour in his sight,
c80319	and the thing <i>seem</i> right before the king,
c80320	and I <i>be</i> pleasing in his eyes,
c80321	let it be written
c80322	to reverse the letters devised by Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite,
c80323	which he wrote
c80324	to destroy the Jews
c80325	which <i>are</i> in all the king's provinces:
c80326	For how can I endure
c80327	to see the evil
c80328	that shall come unto my people?
c80329	or how can I endure
c80330	to see the destruction of my kindred?
c80331	Then the king Ahasuerus said unto Esther the queen and to Mordecai the Jew,
c80332	Behold, I have given Esther the house of Haman,
c80333	and him they have hanged upon the gallows,
c80334	because he laid his hand upon the Jews.
c80335	Write ye also for the Jews, as it liketh you, in the king's name,
c80336	and seal <i>it</i> with the king's ring:
c80337	for the writing
c80338	which is written in the king's name,
c80339	and sealed with the king's ring,
c80340	may no
c80341	man reverse.
c80342	Then were the king's scribes called at that time in the third month,
c80343	that <i>is,</i> the month Sivan,
c80344	on the three and twentieth
c80345	<i>day</i> thereof; and it was written according to all
c80346	that Mordecai commanded
c80347	unto the Jews, and to the lieutenants, and the deputies and rulers of the provinces
c80348	which <i>are</i> from India unto Ethiopia,
c80349	an hundred twenty and seven provinces,
c80350	unto every province according to the writing
c80351	thereof, and unto every people after their language,
c80352	and to the Jews according to their writing, and according to their language.
c80353	And he wrote in the king Ahasuerus' name,
c80354	and sealed <i>it</i> with the king's ring,
c80355	and sent letters by posts on horseback,
c80356	<i>and</i> riders on mules, camels, <i>and</i> young dromedaries:
c80357	Wherein the king granted the Jews
c80358	which <i>were</i> in every city
c80359	to gather themselves together,
c80360	and to stand for their life,
c80361	to destroy,
c80362	to slay,
c80363	and to cause to perish, all the power of the people and province
c80364	that would assault
c80365	them, <i>both</i> little ones and women,
c80366	and <i>to take</i> the spoil
c80367	of them for a prey,
c80368	Upon one day in all the provinces of king Ahasuerus, <i>namely,</i> upon the thirteenth <i>day</i> of the twelfth month,
c80369	which <i>is</i> the month Adar.
c80370	The copy of the writing
c80371	for a commandment to be given in every province
c80372	<i>was</i> published unto all people,
c80373	and that the Jews should be ready against that day
c80374	to avenge themselves on their enemies.
c80375	<i>So</i> the posts that rode upon mules <i>and</i> camels went out,
c80376	being hastened and pressed on
c80377	by the king's commandment.
c80378	And the decree was given at Shushan the palace.
c80379	And Mordecai went out from the presence of the king in royal apparel of blue and white, and with a great crown of gold, and with a garment of fine linen and purple:
c80380	and the city of Shushan rejoiced
c80381	and was glad.
c80382	The Jews had light, and gladness, and joy, and honour.
c80383	And in every province, and in every city, whithersoever
c80384	the king's commandment and his decree came,
c80385	the Jews had joy and gladness,
c80386	a feast and a good day.
c80387	And many of the people of the land became Jews;
c80388	for the fear of the Jews fell upon them.
c80389	Now in the twelfth month,
c80390	that <i>is,</i> the month Adar,
c80391	on the thirteenth day
c80392	of the same, when the king's commandment and his decree drew near
c80393	to be put in execution,
c80394	in the day
c80395	that the enemies of the Jews hoped
c80396	to have power
c80397	over them, (though it was turned to the contrary,
c80398	that the Jews had rule over them that hated them;)
c80399	The Jews gathered themselves together in their cities throughout all the provinces of the king Ahasuerus,
c80400	to lay hand on such as sought their hurt:
c80401	and no man could withstand
c80402	them; for the fear of them fell upon all people.
c80403	And all the rulers of the provinces, and the lieutenants, and the deputies, and officers
c80404	of the king,
c80405	helped the Jews;
c80406	because the fear of Mordecai fell upon them.
c80407	For Mordecai <i>was</i> great in the king's house,
c80408	and his fame went out throughout all the provinces:
c80409	for this man Mordecai waxed
c80410	greater and greater.
c80411	Thus the Jews smote all their enemies with the stroke of the sword, and slaughter, and destruction,
c80412	and did what they would unto those that hated them.
c80413	And in Shushan the palace the Jews slew
c80414	and destroyed five hundred men.
c80415	And Parshandatha, and Dalphon, and Aspatha,
c80416	And Poratha, and Adalia, and Aridatha,
c80417	And Parmashta, and Arisai, and Aridai, and Vajezatha,
c80418	The ten sons of Haman the son of Hammedatha, the enemy of the Jews, slew
c80419	they; but on the spoil laid they not their hand.
c80420	On that day the number of those that were slain in Shushan the palace was brought before the king.
c80421	And the king said unto Esther the queen,
c80422	The Jews have slain and destroyed five hundred men in Shushan the palace,
c80424	and the ten sons of Haman;
c80425	in the rest of the king's provinces?
c80426	what have they done
c80427	now what <i>is</i> thy petition?
c80428	and it shall be granted
c80429	thee: or what <i>is</i> thy request further?
c80430	and it shall be done.
c80431	Then said Esther,
c80432	If it please the king,
c80433	let it be granted to the Jews which <i>are</i> in Shushan
c80435	to do to morrow also according unto this day's decree,
c80436	and let Haman's ten sons be hanged upon the gallows.
c80437	And the king commanded
c80438	it so to be done:
c80439	and the decree was given at Shushan;
c80440	and they hanged Haman's ten sons.
c80441	For the Jews that <i>were</i> in Shushan gathered themselves together
c80443	on the fourteenth day also of the month Adar,
c80444	and slew three hundred men at Shushan;
c80445	but on the prey they laid not their hand.
c80446	But the other Jews
c80447	that <i>were</i> in the king's provinces
c80448	gathered themselves together,
c80449	and stood for their lives,
c80450	and had rest from their enemies,
c80451	and slew of their foes seventy and five thousand,
c80452	but they laid not their hands on the prey,
c80453	On the thirteenth day of the month Adar;
c80454	and on the fourteenth day of the same rested
c80455	they, and made it a day of feasting and gladness.
c80456	But the Jews
c80457	that <i>were</i> at Shushan
c80458	assembled together on the thirteenth <i>day</i> thereof, and on the fourteenth
c80459	thereof; and on the fifteenth <i>day</i> of the same they rested,
c80460	and made it a day of feasting and gladness.
c80461	Therefore the Jews of the villages,
c80462	that dwelt in the unwalled towns,
c80463	made the fourteenth day of the month Adar <i>a day of</i> gladness and feasting,
c80464	and a good day, and of sending portions one to another.
c80465	And Mordecai wrote these things,
c80466	and sent letters unto all the Jews
c80467	that <i>were</i> in all the provinces of the king Ahasuerus,
c80468	<i>both</i> nigh
c80469	and far,
c80470	To stablish <i>this</i> among
c80471	them, that they should keep the fourteenth day of the month Adar, and the fifteenth day of the same, yearly,
c80472	As the days
c80473	wherein the Jews rested from their enemies,
c80474	and the month
c80475	which was turned unto them from sorrow to joy,
c80476	and from mourning into a good day:
c80477	that they should make them days of feasting and joy,
c80478	and of sending portions one to another,
c80479	and gifts to the poor.
c80480	And the Jews undertook
c80481	as they had begun,
c80482	to do
c80483	and as Mordecai had written unto them;
c80484	Because Haman the son of Hammedatha, the Agagite, the enemy of all the Jews, had devised against the Jews
c80485	to destroy
c80486	them, and had cast Pur,
c80487	that <i>is,</i> the lot,
c80488	to consume
c80489	them, and to destroy them;
c80491	But when <i>Esther</i> came before the king,
c80492	he commanded by letters
c80493	that his wicked device, which he devised against the Jews, should return
c80495	upon his own head,
c80496	and that he and his sons should be hanged on the gallows.
c80497	Wherefore they called these days Purim after the name of Pur.
c80498	Therefore for all the words of this letter,
c80499	and <i>of that</i> which they had seen concerning this matter,
c80500	and which had come unto them,
c80502	The Jews ordained, and took upon them, and upon their seed, and upon all
c80503	such as joined themselves unto
c80504	them, so as it should not fail,
c80505	that they would keep these two days according to their writing, and according to their <i>appointed</i> time every year;
c80506	And <i>that</i> these days <i>should be</i> remembered
c80507	and kept throughout every generation, every family, every province, and every city;
c80508	and <i>that</i> these days of Purim should not fail from among the Jews,
c80509	nor the memorial of them perish from their seed.
c80510	Then Esther the queen, the daughter of Abihail, and Mordecai the Jew, wrote with all authority,
c80511	to confirm this second letter of Purim.
c80512	And he sent the letters unto all the Jews, to the hundred twenty and seven provinces of the kingdom of Ahasuerus, <i>with</i> words of peace and truth,
c80513	To confirm these days of Purim in their times
c80514	<i>appointed,</i> according as Mordecai the Jew and Esther the queen had enjoined
c80515	them, and as they had decreed for themselves and for their seed, the matters of the fastings and their cry.
c80516	And the decree of Esther confirmed these matters of Purim;
c80517	and it was written in the book.
c80518	And the king Ahasuerus laid a tribute upon the land, and <i>upon</i> the isles of the sea.
c80519	And all the acts of his power and of his might, and the declaration of the greatness of Mordecai,
c80520	whereunto the king advanced
c80521	him, <i>are</i> they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Media and Persia?
c80522	For Mordecai the Jew <i>was</i> next unto king Ahasuerus,
c80523	and great among the Jews,
c80524	and accepted of the multitude of his brethren,
c80525	seeking the wealth of his people,
c80526	and speaking peace to all his seed.
c80527	In the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah came Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon unto Jerusalem,
c80528	and besieged it.
c80529	And the Lord gave Jehoiakim king of Judah into his hand, with part of the vessels of the house of God:
c80530	which he carried into the land of Shinar to the house of his god;
c80531	and he brought the vessels into the treasure house of his god.
c80532	And the king spake unto Ashpenaz the master of his eunuchs,
c80533	that he should bring <i>certain</i> of the children of Israel, and of the king's seed, and of the princes;
c80534	Children
c80535	in whom <i>was</i> no blemish,
c80536	but well favoured,
c80537	and skilful in all wisdom,
c80538	and cunning in knowledge,
c80539	and understanding science,
c80540	and such as <i>had</i> ability
c80541	in them to stand in the king's palace,
c80542	and whom they might teach the learning and the tongue of the Chaldeans.
c80543	And the king appointed them a daily provision of the king's meat, and of the wine which he drank:
c80544	so nourishing them three years,
c80545	that at the end thereof they might stand before the king.
c80546	Now among these were
c80547	of the children of Judah, Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah:
c80548	Unto whom the prince of the eunuchs gave names:
c80549	for he gave unto Daniel <i>the name</i> of Belteshazzar;
c80550	and to Hananiah, of Shadrach;
c80551	and to Mishael, of Meshach;
c80552	and to Azariah, of Abednego.
c80553	But Daniel purposed in his heart
c80554	that he would not defile himself with the portion of the king's meat, nor with the wine which he drank:
c80555	therefore he requested of the prince of the eunuchs
c80556	that he might not defile himself.
c80557	Now God had brought Daniel into favour and tender love with the prince of the eunuchs.
c80558	And the prince of the eunuchs said unto Daniel,
c80559	I fear my lord the king,
c80560	who hath appointed your meat and your drink:
c80561	for why should he see your faces
c80562	worse liking than the children
c80563	which <i>are</i> of your sort?
c80564	then shall ye make <i>me</i> endanger my head to the king.
c80565	Then said Daniel to Melzar,
c80566	whom the prince of the eunuchs had set over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah,
c80567	Prove thy servants, I beseech thee, ten days;
c80568	and let them give us pulse
c80569	to eat,
c80570	and water
c80571	to drink.
c80572	Then let our countenances be looked upon before thee, and the countenance of the children
c80573	that eat of the portion of the king's meat:
c80575	and as thou seest,
c80576	deal with thy servants.
c80577	So he consented to them in this matter,
c80578	and proved them ten days.
c80579	And at the end of ten days their countenances appeared
c80580	fairer and fatter in flesh than all the children
c80581	which did eat the portion of the king's meat.
c80583	Thus Melzar took away the portion of their meat, and the wine that they should drink;
c80584	and gave them pulse.
c80585	As for these four children,
c80586	God gave them knowledge
c80587	and skill in all learning and wisdom:
c80588	and Daniel had understanding in all visions and dreams.
c80589	Now at the end of the days
c80590	that the king had said
c80591	he should bring them in,
c80592	then the prince of the eunuchs brought them in before Nebuchadnezzar.
c80593	And the king communed with
c80594	them; and among them all was found none like Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah:
c80595	therefore stood they before the king.
c80596	And in all matters of wisdom <i>and</i> understanding,
c80597	that the king enquired of
c80598	them, he found them ten times better than all the magicians <i>and</i> astrologers
c80599	that <i>were</i> in all his realm.
c80600	And Daniel continued <i>even</i> unto the first year of king Cyrus.
c80601	And in the second year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar Nebuchadnezzar dreamed dreams,
c80602	wherewith his spirit was troubled,
c80603	and his sleep brake from him.
c80604	Then the king commanded
c80605	to call the magicians, and the astrologers, and the sorcerers, and the Chaldeans,
c80606	for to shew the king his dreams.
c80607	So they came
c80608	and stood before the king.
c80609	And the king said
c80610	unto them, I have dreamed a dream,
c80611	and my spirit was troubled
c80612	to know the dream.
c80613	Then spake the Chaldeans to the king in Syriack,
c80614	O king,
c80615	live for ever:
c80616	tell thy servants the dream,
c80617	and we will shew the interpretation.
c80618	The king answered
c80619	and said to the Chaldeans,
c80620	The thing is gone from
c80621	me: if ye will not make known unto me the dream, with the interpretation
c80622	thereof, ye shall be cut in pieces,
c80623	and your houses shall be made a dunghill.
c80624	But if ye shew the dream, and the interpretation
c80625	thereof, ye shall receive of me gifts and rewards and great honour:
c80626	therefore shew me the dream, and the interpretation thereof.
c80627	They answered again
c80628	and said,
c80629	Let the king tell his servants the dream,
c80630	and we will shew the interpretation of it.
c80631	The king answered
c80632	and said,
c80633	I know of certainty
c80634	that ye would gain the time,
c80635	because ye see
c80636	the thing is gone from me.
c80637	But if ye will not make known unto me the dream,
c80638	<i>there is but</i> one decree
c80639	for you: for ye have prepared lying and corrupt words
c80640	to speak before
c80641	me, till the time be changed:
c80642	therefore tell me the dream,
c80643	and I shall know
c80644	that ye can shew me the interpretation thereof.
c80645	The Chaldeans answered before the king,
c80646	and said,
c80647	There is not a man upon the earth
c80648	that can shew the king's matter:
c80650	therefore <i>there is</i> no king, lord, nor ruler, <i>that</i> asked such things at any magician, or astrologer, or Chaldean.
c80651	thing
c80652	that the king requireth,
c80653	And <i>it is</i> a rare
c80654	and there is none other
c80655	that can shew it before the king,
c80656	except the gods,
c80657	whose dwelling
c80658	is not with flesh.
c80659	For this cause the king was angry
c80660	and very furious,
c80661	and commanded
c80662	to destroy all the wise <i>men</i> of Babylon.
c80663	And the decree went forth
c80664	that the wise <i>men</i> should be slain;
c80665	and they sought Daniel and his fellows
c80666	to be slain.
c80667	Then Daniel answered with counsel and wisdom to Arioch the captain of the king's guard,
c80668	which was gone forth
c80669	to slay the wise <i>men</i> of Babylon:
c80670	He answered
c80671	and said to Arioch the king's captain,
c80672	Why <i>is</i> the decree <i>so</i> hasty from the king?
c80673	Then Arioch made the thing known to Daniel.
c80674	Then Daniel went in,
c80675	and desired of the king
c80676	that he would give him time,
c80677	and that he would shew the king the interpretation.
c80678	Then Daniel went to his house,
c80679	and made the thing known to Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, his companions:
c80680	That they would desire mercies of the God of heaven concerning this secret;
c80681	that Daniel and his fellows should not perish with the rest of the wise <i>men</i> of Babylon.
c80682	Then was the secret revealed unto Daniel in a night vision.
c80683	Then Daniel blessed the God of heaven.
c80684	Daniel answered
c80685	and said,
c80686	Blessed be the name of God for ever and ever:
c80687	for wisdom and might are his:
c80689	And he changeth the times and the seasons:
c80690	he removeth kings,
c80691	and setteth up kings:
c80692	he giveth wisdom unto the wise,
c80693	and knowledge to them that know understanding:
c80694	He revealeth the deep and secret things:
c80695	he knoweth what <i>is</i> in the darkness,
c80696	and the light dwelleth with him.
c80698	thee, O thou God of my fathers,
c80700	I thank thee, and praise
c80701	who hast given me wisdom and might,
c80702	and hast made known unto me now
c80703	what we desired of
c80704	thee: for thou hast <i>now</i> made known unto us the king's matter.
c80705	Therefore Daniel went in unto Arioch,
c80706	whom the king had ordained
c80707	to destroy the wise <i>men</i> of Babylon:
c80708	he went
c80709	and said thus
c80710	unto him; Destroy not the wise <i>men</i> of Babylon:
c80711	bring me in before the king,
c80712	and I will shew unto the king the interpretation.
c80713	Then Arioch brought in Daniel before the king in haste,
c80714	and said thus
c80715	unto him, I have found a man of the captives of Judah, that
c80716	will make known unto the king the interpretation.
c80717	The king answered
c80718	and said to Daniel,
c80719	whose name <i>was</i> Belteshazzar,
c80720	Art thou able
c80721	to make known unto me the dream
c80722	which I have seen,
c80723	and the interpretation thereof?
c80724	Daniel answered in the presence of the king,
c80725	and said,
c80726	The secret
c80727	which the king hath demanded
c80728	cannot the wise <i>men,</i> the astrologers, the magicians, the soothsayers,
c80729	shew unto the king;
c80730	But there is a God in heaven
c80731	that revealeth secrets,
c80732	and maketh known to the king Nebuchadnezzar what
c80733	shall be in the latter days.
c80734	Thy dream, and the visions of thy head upon thy bed,
c80735	are these;
c80736	As for thee,
c80737	O king,
c80738	thy thoughts came <i>into thy mind</i> upon thy bed,
c80739	what
c80740	should come to pass hereafter:
c80742	and he that revealeth secrets
c80743	maketh known to thee what
c80744	shall come to pass.
c80745	But as for me,
c80746	to me for <i>any</i> wisdom
c80747	that I have more than any living,
c80748	this secret is not revealed
c80749	but for <i>their</i> sakes
c80750	that shall make known the interpretation to the king,
c80751	and that thou mightest know the thoughts of thy heart.
c80752	Thou,
c80753	O king,
c80754	sawest,
c80755	and behold a great image.
c80756	This great image,
c80757	whose brightness <i>was</i> excellent,
c80758	stood before
c80759	thee; and the form thereof <i>was</i> terrible.
c80760	This image's
c80761	head <i>was</i> of fine gold,
c80762	his breast and his arms of silver,
c80763	his belly and his thighs of brass,
c80764	His legs of iron,
c80765	his feet
c80766	part of iron
c80767	and part of clay.
c80768	Thou sawest
c80769	till that a stone was cut out
c80770	without hands,
c80771	which smote the image upon his feet
c80772	<i>that were</i> of iron and clay,
c80773	and brake them to pieces.
c80774	Then was the iron, the clay, the brass, the silver, and the gold, broken to pieces together,
c80775	and became like the chaff of the summer threshingfloors;
c80776	and the wind carried them away,
c80777	that no place was found
c80778	for them: and the stone
c80779	that smote the image
c80780	became a great mountain,
c80781	and filled the whole earth.
c80782	This <i>is</i> the dream;
c80783	and we will tell the interpretation thereof before the king.
c80784	Thou,
c80785	O king,
c80786	<i>art</i> a king of kings:
c80787	for the God of heaven hath given thee a kingdom, power, and strength, and glory.
c80788	And wheresoever
c80789	the children of men dwell,
c80790	the beasts of the field and the fowls of the heaven hath he given into thine hand,
c80791	and hath made thee ruler over them all.
c80792	Thou <i>art</i> this head of gold.
c80793	And after thee shall arise another kingdom inferior to
c80794	thee, and another third kingdom of brass,
c80795	which shall bear rule over all the earth.
c80796	And the fourth kingdom shall be strong as iron:
c80797	forasmuch as iron breaketh in pieces
c80798	and subdueth all
c80799	<i>things:</i> and as iron
c80800	that breaketh all these,
c80801	shall it break in pieces
c80802	and bruise.
c80803	And whereas thou sawest the feet and toes,
c80804	part of potters' clay,
c80805	and part of iron,
c80806	the kingdom shall be divided;
c80807	but there shall be in it of the strength of the iron,
c80808	forasmuch as thou sawest
c80809	the iron mixed with miry clay.
c80810	And <i>as</i> the toes of the feet
c80811	<i>were</i> part of iron,
c80812	and part of clay,
c80813	<i>so</i> the kingdom shall be partly strong,
c80814	and partly broken.
c80815	And whereas thou sawest
c80816	iron mixed with miry clay,
c80817	they shall mingle themselves with the seed of men:
c80818	but they shall not cleave
c80819	one to another,
c80820	even as
c80821	iron is not mixed with clay.
c80822	And in the days of these kings shall the God of heaven set up a kingdom,
c80823	which shall never be destroyed:
c80824	and the kingdom shall not be left to other people,
c80825	<i>but</i> it shall break in pieces
c80826	and consume all these kingdoms,
c80827	and it shall stand for ever.
c80828	Forasmuch as thou sawest
c80829	that the stone was cut out of the mountain
c80830	without hands,
c80831	and that it brake in pieces the iron, the brass, the clay, the silver, and the gold;
c80832	the great God hath made known to the king what
c80833	shall come to pass hereafter:
c80834	and the dream <i>is</i> certain,
c80835	and the interpretation thereof sure.
c80836	Then the king Nebuchadnezzar fell upon his face,
c80837	and worshipped Daniel,
c80838	and commanded that they should offer an oblation and sweet odours unto him.
c80840	The king answered unto Daniel,
c80841	and said,
c80842	Of a truth
c80843	<i>it is,</i> that your God <i>is</i> a God of gods, and a Lord of kings,
c80844	and a revealer of secrets,
c80845	seeing thou couldest
c80846	reveal this secret.
c80847	Then the king made Daniel a great man,
c80848	and gave him many great gifts,
c80849	and made him ruler over the whole province of Babylon,
c80850	and chief of the governors over all the wise <i>men</i> of Babylon.
c80851	Then Daniel requested of the king,
c80852	and he set Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, over the affairs of the province of Babylon:
c80853	but Daniel <i>sat</i> in the gate of the king.
c80854	Nebuchadnezzar the king made an image of gold,
c80855	whose height <i>was</i> threescore cubits,
c80856	<i>and</i> the breadth thereof six cubits:
c80857	he set it up in the plain of Dura, in the province of Babylon.
c80858	Then Nebuchadnezzar the king sent
c80859	to gather together the princes, the governors, and the captains, the judges, the treasurers, the counsellors, the sheriffs, and all the rulers of the provinces,
c80860	to come to the dedication of the image
c80861	which Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up.
c80862	Then the princes, the governors, and captains, the judges, the treasurers, the counsellors, the sheriffs, and all the rulers of the provinces, were gathered together unto the dedication of the image
c80863	that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up;
c80864	and they stood before the image
c80865	that Nebuchadnezzar had set up.
c80866	Then an herald cried aloud,
c80867	To you it is commanded,
c80868	O people, nations, and languages,
c80870	<i>That</i> at what time ye hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, dulcimer, and all kinds of musick,
c80871	ye fall down
c80872	and worship the golden image
c80873	that Nebuchadnezzar the king hath set up:
c80874	And whoso
c80875	falleth not down
c80876	and worshippeth
c80877	shall the same hour be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace.
c80878	Therefore at that time,
c80879	when all the people heard the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and all kinds of musick,
c80880	all the people, the nations, and the languages, fell down
c80881	<i>and</i> worshipped the golden image
c80882	that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up.
c80883	Wherefore at that time certain Chaldeans came near,
c80884	and accused the Jews.
c80885	They spake
c80886	and said to the king Nebuchadnezzar,
c80887	O king,
c80888	live for ever.
c80889	Thou,
c80890	O king,
c80891	hast made a decree,
c80892	that every man
c80893	that shall hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and dulcimer, and all kinds of musick,
c80894	shall fall down
c80895	and worship the golden image:
c80896	And whoso
c80897	falleth not down
c80898	and worshippeth,
c80899	<i>that</i> he should be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace.
c80900	There are certain Jews
c80901	whom thou hast set over the affairs of the province of Babylon,
c80902	Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego;
c80903	these men, O king, have not regarded
c80906	thee: they serve not thy gods,
c80907	the golden image
c80908	which thou hast set up.
c80909	nor worship
c80910	Then Nebuchadnezzar in <i>his</i> rage and fury commanded
c80911	to bring Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego.
c80912	Then they brought these men before the king.
c80913	Nebuchadnezzar spake
c80914	and said
c80915	unto them, <i>Is it</i> true,
c80916	O Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego,
c80917	do not ye serve my gods,
c80918	the golden image
c80919	which I have set up?
c80920	nor worship
c80921	Now
c80922	if ye be ready
c80923	that at what time
c80924	ye hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and dulcimer, and all kinds of musick,
c80925	ye fall down
c80926	and worship the image
c80927	which I have made;
c80928	<i>well:</i> but if ye worship not,
c80929	ye shall be cast the same hour into the midst of a burning fiery furnace;
c80930	and who <i>is</i> that God
c80931	that shall deliver you out of my hands?
c80932	Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, answered
c80933	and said to the king, O Nebuchadnezzar,
c80934	we <i>are</i> not careful
c80935	to answer thee in this matter.
c80936	If it be <i>so,</i> our God
c80937	whom we serve
c80938	is able
c80939	to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace,
c80940	<i>us</i> out of thine hand,
c80941	O king.
c80942	and he will deliver
c80943	But if not,
c80944	be it known
c80945	unto thee, O king,
c80946	that we will not serve thy gods,
c80947	the golden image
c80948	which thou hast set up.
c80949	nor worship
c80950	Then was Nebuchadnezzar full of fury,
c80951	and the form of his visage was changed against Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego:
c80952	<i>therefore</i> he spake,
c80953	and commanded
c80954	that they should heat the furnace one seven times
c80955	more than it was wont
c80956	to be heated.
c80957	the most mighty men
c80958	that <i>were</i> in his army
c80959	And he commanded
c80960	to bind Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego,
c80961	<i>and</i> to cast <i>them</i> into the burning fiery furnace.
c80962	Then these men were bound in their coats, their hosen, and their hats, and their <i>other</i> garments,
c80963	and were cast into the midst of the burning fiery furnace.
c80964	Therefore
c80965	because the king's commandment was urgent,
c80966	and the furnace exceeding hot,
c80968	took up Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego.
c80969	the flame of the fire slew those men that
c80970	And these three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, fell down bound into the midst of the burning fiery furnace.
c80972	Then Nebuchadnezzar the king was astonied,
c80973	and rose up
c80974	in haste,
c80975	<i>and</i> spake,
c80976	and said unto his counsellors,
c80977	Did not we cast three men bound into the midst of the fire?
c80979	They answered
c80980	and said unto the king,
c80981	True,
c80982	O king.
c80983	He answered
c80984	and said,
c80985	Lo, I see four men
c80986	loose,
c80987	walking in the midst of the fire,
c80988	and they have no hurt;
c80989	and the form of the fourth is like the Son of God.
c80990	Then Nebuchadnezzar came near to the mouth of the burning fiery furnace,
c80991	<i>and</i> spake,
c80992	and said,
c80993	Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, ye servants of the most high God,
c80994	come forth,
c80995	and come
c80996	<i>hither.</i> Then Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, came forth of the midst of the fire.
c80997	And the princes, governors, and captains, and the king's counsellors, being gathered together,
c80998	saw these men,
c80999	upon whose bodies the fire had no power,
c81000	nor was an hair of their head singed,
c81001	neither were their coats changed,
c81002	nor the smell of fire had passed on them.
c81003	<i>Then</i> Nebuchadnezzar spake,
c81004	and said,
c81005	Blessed <i>be</i> the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego,
c81006	who hath sent his angel,
c81007	and delivered his servants
c81008	that trusted in
c81009	him, and have changed the king's word,
c81010	and yielded their bodies,
c81011	that they might not serve
c81012	nor worship any god,
c81013	except their own God.
c81014	Therefore I make a decree,
c81015	That every people, nation, and language,
c81016	which speak any thing amiss against the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego,
c81017	shall be cut in pieces,
c81018	and their houses shall be made a dunghill:
c81019	because there is no other God
c81020	that can
c81021	deliver after this sort.
c81022	Then the king promoted Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, in the province of Babylon.
c81023	Nebuchadnezzar the king, unto all people, nations, and languages,
c81024	that dwell in all the earth;
c81025	Peace be multiplied unto you.
c81026	the signs and wonders
c81027	that the high God hath wrought toward me.
c81028	I thought it good
c81029	to shew
c81030	How great <i>are</i> his signs!
c81031	and how mighty <i>are</i> his wonders!
c81032	his kingdom <i>is</i> an everlasting kingdom,
c81033	and his dominion <i>is</i> from generation to generation.
c81034	I Nebuchadnezzar was at rest in mine house,
c81035	and flourishing in my palace:
c81036	I saw a dream
c81037	which made me afraid,
c81038	and the thoughts upon my bed and the visions of my head troubled me.
c81039	Therefore made I a decree
c81040	to bring in all the wise <i>men</i> of Babylon before
c81041	me, that they might make known unto me the interpretation of the dream.
c81042	Then came in the magicians, the astrologers, the Chaldeans, and the soothsayers:
c81043	and I told the dream before
c81044	them; but they did not make known unto me the interpretation thereof.
c81045	But at the last Daniel came in before
c81046	me, whose name <i>was</i> Belteshazzar, according to the name of my god,
c81047	and in whom <i>is</i> the spirit of the holy gods:
c81048	and before him I told the dream, <i>saying,</i>
c81049	O Belteshazzar, master of the magicians,
c81050	because I know
c81051	that the spirit of the holy gods
c81052	<i>is</i> in thee, and no secret troubleth
c81054	that I have seen, and the interpretation thereof.
c81055	thee, tell me the visions of my dream
c81056	Thus <i>were</i> the visions of mine head in my bed; I saw,
c81057	and behold a tree in the midst of the earth,
c81058	and the height thereof <i>was</i> great.
c81059	The tree grew,
c81060	and was strong,
c81061	and the height thereof reached unto heaven,
c81062	and the sight thereof to the end of all the earth:
c81063	The leaves thereof <i>were</i> fair,
c81064	and the fruit thereof much,
c81065	and in it <i>was</i> meat for all:
c81066	the beasts of the field had shadow under
c81067	it, and the fowls of the heaven dwelt in the boughs
c81068	thereof, and all flesh was fed of it.
c81069	I saw in the visions of my head upon my bed,
c81070	and, behold, a watcher and an holy one came down from heaven;
c81071	He cried aloud,
c81072	and said thus,
c81073	Hew down the tree,
c81074	and cut off his branches,
c81075	shake off his leaves,
c81076	and scatter his fruit:
c81077	let the beasts get away from under
c81078	it, and the fowls from his branches:
c81079	Nevertheless leave the stump of his roots in the earth,
c81080	even with a band of iron and brass, in the tender grass of the field;
c81081	and let it be wet with the dew of heaven,
c81082	and <i>let</i> his portion <i>be</i> with the beasts in the grass of the earth:
c81083	Let his heart be changed from man's,
c81084	and let a beast's heart be given
c81085	unto him; and let seven times pass over him.
c81086	This matter <i>is</i> by the decree of the watchers,
c81087	and the demand by the word of the holy ones:
c81088	to the intent that the living may know
c81089	that the most High ruleth in the kingdom of men,
c81090	it to whomsoever
c81091	he will,
c81092	and giveth
c81093	and setteth up over it the basest of men.
c81094	This dream I king Nebuchadnezzar have seen.
c81095	Now thou,
c81096	O Belteshazzar,
c81097	declare the interpretation
c81098	thereof, forasmuch as all the wise <i>men</i> of my kingdom are not able
c81099	to make known unto me the interpretation:
c81100	but thou <i>art</i> able;
c81101	for the spirit of the holy gods <i>is</i> in thee.
c81102	Then Daniel,
c81103	whose name <i>was</i> Belteshazzar,
c81104	was astonied for one hour,
c81105	and his thoughts troubled
c81106	him. The king spake,
c81107	and said,
c81108	Belteshazzar,
c81109	let not the dream, or the interpretation thereof, trouble
c81110	thee. Belteshazzar answered
c81111	and said,
c81112	My lord,
c81113	the dream <i>be</i> to them that hate
c81114	thee, and the interpretation thereof to thine enemies.
c81115	The tree
c81116	that thou sawest,
c81117	which grew,
c81118	and was strong,
c81119	whose height reached unto the heaven,
c81120	and the sight thereof to all the earth;
c81121	Whose leaves <i>were</i> fair,
c81122	and the fruit thereof much,
c81123	and in it <i>was</i> meat for all;
c81124	under which the beasts of the field dwelt,
c81125	and upon whose branches the fowls of the heaven had their habitation:
c81126	It <i>is</i> thou,
c81127	O king,
c81128	that art grown
c81129	and become strong:
c81130	for thy greatness is grown,
c81131	and reacheth unto heaven,
c81132	and thy dominion to the end of the earth.
c81133	And whereas the king saw
c81134	a watcher and an holy one coming down from heaven,
c81135	and saying,
c81136	Hew the tree down,
c81137	and destroy
c81138	it; yet leave the stump of the roots thereof in the earth,
c81139	even with a band of iron and brass, in the tender grass of the field;
c81140	and let it be wet with the dew of heaven,
c81141	and <i>let</i> his portion <i>be</i> with the beasts of the field,
c81142	till seven times pass over him;
c81143	This <i>is</i> the interpretation,
c81144	O king,
c81145	and this <i>is</i> the decree of the most High,
c81146	which is come upon my lord the king:
c81147	That they shall drive thee from men,
c81148	and thy dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field,
c81149	and they shall make thee to eat grass as oxen,
c81150	and they shall wet thee with the dew of heaven,
c81151	and seven times shall pass over
c81152	thee, till thou know
c81153	that the most High ruleth in the kingdom of men,
c81154	it to whomsoever
c81155	he will.
c81156	and giveth
c81157	And whereas they commanded
c81158	to leave the stump of the tree roots;
c81159	thy kingdom shall be sure
c81160	unto thee, after that thou shalt have known
c81161	that the heavens do rule.
c81162	Wherefore,
c81163	O king,
c81164	let my counsel be acceptable unto
c81165	thee, and break off thy sins by righteousness,
c81166	and thine iniquities
c81167	by shewing mercy to the poor;
c81168	if it may be a lengthening of thy tranquillity.
c81169	All this came upon the king Nebuchadnezzar.
c81170	At the end of twelve months he walked in the palace of the kingdom of Babylon.
c81171	The king spake,
c81172	and said,
c81173	Is not this great Babylon,
c81174	that I have built for the house of the kingdom by the might of my power,
c81175	and for the honour of my majesty?
c81176	While the word <i>was</i> in the king's mouth,
c81177	there fell a voice from heaven,
c81178	to thee it is spoken;
c81179	<i>saying,</i> O king Nebuchadnezzar,
c81180	The kingdom is departed from thee.
c81181	And they shall drive thee from men,
c81182	and thy dwelling <i>shall be</i> with the beasts of the field:
c81183	they shall make thee to eat grass as oxen,
c81184	and seven times shall pass over
c81185	thee, until thou know
c81186	that the most High ruleth in the kingdom of men,
c81187	it to whomsoever
c81188	he will.
c81189	and giveth
c81190	The same hour was the thing fulfilled upon Nebuchadnezzar:
c81191	and he was driven from men,
c81192	and did eat grass as oxen,
c81193	and his body was wet with the dew of heaven,
c81194	till his hairs were grown like eagles'
c81195	<i>feathers,</i> and his nails like birds' <i>claws.</i>
c81196	And at the end of the days I Nebuchadnezzar lifted up mine eyes unto heaven,
c81197	and mine understanding returned unto
c81198	me, and I blessed the most High,
c81199	and I praised and honoured him that liveth for ever,
c81201	whose dominion <i>is</i> an everlasting dominion,
c81202	and his kingdom <i>is</i> from generation to generation:
c81203	And all the inhabitants of the earth <i>are</i> reputed as nothing:
c81204	and he doeth according to his will in the army of heaven, and <i>among</i> the inhabitants of the earth:
c81205	and none can
c81206	stay his hand,
c81207	or say
c81208	unto him, What doest thou?
c81209	At the same time my reason returned unto
c81210	me; and for the glory of my kingdom, mine honour and brightness returned unto
c81211	me; and my counsellors and my lords sought
c81212	unto me; and I was established in my kingdom,
c81213	and excellent majesty was added unto me.
c81214	Now I Nebuchadnezzar praise
c81215	and extol
c81216	and honour the King of heaven,
c81217	all whose works <i>are</i> truth,
c81218	and his ways judgment:
c81220	and those that walk in pride
c81221	he is able
c81222	to abase.
c81223	Belshazzar the king made a great feast to a thousand of his lords,
c81224	and drank wine before the thousand.
c81225	Belshazzar, whiles he tasted the wine, commanded
c81226	to bring the golden and silver vessels
c81227	which his father Nebuchadnezzar had taken out of the temple
c81228	which <i>was</i> in Jerusalem;
c81229	that the king, and his princes, his wives, and his concubines, might drink therein.
c81230	Then they brought the golden vessels
c81231	that were taken out of the temple of the house of God
c81232	which <i>was</i> at Jerusalem;
c81233	and the king, and his princes, his wives, and his concubines, drank in them.
c81234	They drank wine,
c81235	and praised the gods of gold, and of silver, of brass, of iron, of wood, and of stone.
c81236	In the same hour came forth fingers of a man's hand,
c81237	and wrote over against the candlestick upon the plaister of the wall of the king's palace:
c81238	and the king saw the part of the hand
c81239	that wrote.
c81240	Then the king's
c81241	countenance was changed,
c81242	and his thoughts troubled
c81243	him, so that the joints of his loins were loosed,
c81244	and his knees
c81245	one against another.
c81246	smote
c81247	The king cried aloud
c81248	to bring in the astrologers, the Chaldeans, and the soothsayers.
c81249	<i>And</i> the king spake,
c81250	and said to the wise <i>men</i> of Babylon,
c81251	Whosoever
c81252	shall read this writing, and shew me the interpretation
c81254	thereof, shall be clothed with scarlet,
c81255	and <i>have</i> a chain of gold about his neck,
c81256	and shall be the third ruler in the kingdom.
c81257	Then came in all the king's wise
c81258	<i>men:</i> but they could not
c81259	read the writing,
c81260	nor make known to the king the interpretation thereof.
c81261	Then was king Belshazzar greatly troubled,
c81262	and his countenance was changed in
c81263	him, and his lords were astonied.
c81264	<i>Now</i> the queen, by reason of the words of the king and his lords, came into the banquet house:
c81265	<i>and</i> the queen spake
c81266	and said,
c81267	O king,
c81268	live for ever:
c81269	let not thy thoughts trouble
c81270	thee, nor let thy countenance be changed:
c81271	There is a man in thy kingdom,
c81272	in whom <i>is</i> the spirit of the holy gods;
c81273	and in the days of thy father light and understanding and wisdom, like the wisdom of the gods, was found
c81274	in him; whom the king Nebuchadnezzar thy father, the king, <i>I say,</i> thy father, made master of the magicians, astrologers, Chaldeans, <i>and</i> soothsayers;
c81276	Forasmuch as an excellent spirit, and knowledge, and understanding,
c81277	the interpretation.
c81278	and shewing of hard sentences,
c81279	and dissolving of doubts,
c81280	were found in the same Daniel,
c81281	whom the king named Belteshazzar:
c81282	now let Daniel be called, and he will shew
c81283	interpreting of dreams,
c81284	Then was Daniel brought in before the king.
c81285	<i>And</i> the king spake
c81286	and said unto Daniel,
c81287	<i>Art</i> thou that Daniel,
c81288	which <i>art</i> of the children of the captivity of Judah,
c81289	whom the king my father brought out of Jewry?
c81290	I have even heard of
c81291	thee, that the spirit of the gods
c81292	<i>is</i> in thee, and <i>that</i> light and understanding and excellent wisdom is found in thee.
c81293	And now the wise <i>men,</i> the astrologers, have been brought in before
c81294	me, that they should read this writing,
c81295	and make known unto me the interpretation
c81296	thereof: but they could not
c81297	shew the interpretation of the thing:
c81298	And I have heard of
c81299	thee, that thou canst
c81300	make interpretations,
c81301	and dissolve doubts:
c81302	now
c81303	if thou canst
c81304	read the writing,
c81305	and make known to me the interpretation
c81306	thereof, thou shalt be clothed with scarlet,
c81307	and <i>have</i> a chain of gold about thy neck,
c81308	and shalt be the third ruler in the kingdom.
c81309	Then Daniel answered
c81310	and said before the king,
c81311	Let thy gifts be
c81312	to thyself, and give thy rewards to another;
c81313	yet I will read the writing unto the king,
c81314	and make known to him the interpretation.
c81315	O thou
c81316	king,
c81317	the most high God gave Nebuchadnezzar thy father a kingdom, and majesty, and glory, and honour:
c81318	And for the majesty
c81319	that he gave
c81320	him, all people, nations, and languages, trembled
c81321	and feared before
c81322	him: whom he would
c81323	he slew;
c81325	and whom he would
c81326	he kept alive;
c81328	and whom he would
c81329	he set up;
c81331	and whom he would
c81332	he put down.
c81333	But when his heart was lifted up,
c81334	and his mind hardened
c81335	in pride,
c81336	he was deposed from his kingly throne,
c81337	and they took his glory from him:
c81338	And he was driven from the sons of men;
c81339	and his heart was made like the beasts,
c81340	and his dwelling <i>was</i> with the wild asses:
c81341	they fed him with grass like oxen,
c81342	and his body was wet with the dew of heaven;
c81343	till he knew
c81344	that the most high God ruled in the kingdom of men,
c81345	it whomsoever
c81346	he will.
c81347	and <i>that</i> he appointeth over
c81348	And thou his son, O Belshazzar, hast not humbled thine heart,
c81349	though thou knewest all this;
c81350	But hast lifted up thyself against the Lord of heaven;
c81351	and they have brought the vessels of his house before
c81352	thee, and thou, and thy lords, thy wives, and thy concubines, have drunk wine
c81353	the gods of silver, and gold, of brass, iron, wood, and stone,
c81354	which see not,
c81355	nor hear,
c81356	nor know:
c81357	in them; and thou hast praised
c81358	and the God
c81359	in whose hand thy breath
c81360	<i>is,</i> and whose <i>are</i> all thy ways,
c81361	hast thou not glorified:
c81362	Then was the part of the hand sent from
c81363	him; and this writing was written.
c81364	And this <i>is</i> the writing
c81365	that was written,
c81366	MENE, MENE, TEKEL, UPHARSIN.
c81367	This <i>is</i> the interpretation of the thing:
c81368	MENE;
c81369	God hath numbered thy kingdom,
c81370	and finished it.
c81371	TEKEL;
c81372	Thou art weighed in the balances,
c81373	and art found wanting.
c81374	PERES;
c81375	Thy kingdom is divided,
c81376	and given to the Medes and Persians.
c81377	Then commanded Belshazzar,
c81378	and they clothed Daniel with scarlet,
c81379	and <i>put</i> a chain of gold about his neck,
c81380	and made a proclamation concerning
c81381	him, that he should be the third ruler in the kingdom.
c81382	In that night was Belshazzar the king of the Chaldeans slain.
c81383	And Darius the Median took the kingdom, <i>being</i> about threescore and two years old.
c81384	It pleased Darius
c81385	to set over the kingdom an hundred and twenty princes,
c81386	which should be over the whole kingdom;
c81387	And over these three presidents;
c81388	of whom Daniel <i>was</i> first:
c81389	that the princes might give accounts
c81390	unto them, and the king should have no damage.
c81391	Then this Daniel was preferred above the presidents and princes,
c81392	because an excellent spirit
c81393	<i>was</i> in him; and the king thought
c81394	to set him over the whole realm.
c81395	Then the presidents and princes sought to find occasion
c81396	against Daniel concerning the kingdom;
c81397	but they could find none occasion nor fault;
c81399	forasmuch as he <i>was</i> faithful,
c81400	neither was there any error or fault found in him.
c81401	Then said these men,
c81402	We shall not find any occasion against this Daniel,
c81403	except we find <i>it</i> against him concerning the law of his God.
c81404	Then these presidents and princes assembled together to the king,
c81405	and said thus
c81406	unto him, King Darius,
c81407	live for ever.
c81408	All the presidents of the kingdom, the governors, and the princes, the counsellors, and the captains, have consulted together
c81409	to establish a royal statute,
c81410	and to make a firm decree,
c81411	that whosoever
c81412	shall ask a petition of any God or man for thirty days,
c81413	save of
c81414	thee, O king,
c81415	he shall be cast into the den of lions.
c81416	Now,
c81417	O king,
c81418	establish the decree,
c81419	and sign the writing,
c81420	that it be not changed, according to the law of the Medes and Persians,
c81421	which altereth not.
c81422	Wherefore king Darius signed the writing and the decree.
c81424	Now when Daniel knew
c81425	that the writing was signed,
c81426	he went into his house;
c81427	and his windows being open in his chamber toward Jerusalem,
c81428	he kneeled upon his knees three times a day,
c81429	and prayed,
c81430	and gave thanks before his God,
c81431	as he did aforetime.
c81432	Then these men assembled,
c81433	and found Daniel
c81434	praying
c81435	and making supplication before his God.
c81436	Then they came near,
c81437	and spake before the king concerning the king's decree;
c81438	Hast thou not signed a decree,
c81439	that every man
c81440	that shall ask <i>a petition</i> of any God or man within thirty days,
c81441	save of
c81442	thee, O king,
c81443	shall be cast into the den of lions?
c81444	The king answered
c81445	and said,
c81446	The thing <i>is</i> true, according to the law of the Medes and Persians,
c81447	which altereth not.
c81448	Then answered
c81449	they and said before the king,
c81450	That Daniel,
c81451	which <i>is</i> of the children of the captivity of Judah,
c81452	regardeth not
c81453	thee, O king,
c81455	nor the decree
c81456	that thou hast signed,
c81457	but maketh his petition three times a day.
c81458	Then the king,
c81459	when he heard <i>these</i> words,
c81460	was sore displeased with
c81461	himself, and set <i>his</i> heart on Daniel
c81462	to deliver
c81463	him: and he laboured till the going down of the sun
c81464	to deliver him.
c81465	Then these men assembled unto the king,
c81466	and said unto the king,
c81467	Know,
c81468	O king,
c81469	that the law of the Medes and Persians
c81470	<i>is,</i> That no decree nor statute
c81471	which the king establisheth
c81473	may be changed.
c81474	Then the king commanded,
c81475	and they brought Daniel,
c81476	and cast <i>him</i> into the den of lions.
c81477	<i>Now</i> the king spake
c81478	and said unto Daniel,
c81479	Thy God
c81480	whom thou servest continually,
c81481	he will deliver thee.
c81482	And a stone was brought,
c81483	and laid upon the mouth of the den;
c81484	and the king sealed it with his own signet, and with the signet of his lords;
c81485	that the purpose might not be changed concerning Daniel.
c81486	Then the king went to his palace,
c81487	and passed the night fasting:
c81488	neither were instruments of musick brought before
c81489	him: and his sleep went from him.
c81490	Then the king arose very early in the morning,
c81491	and went in haste unto the den of lions.
c81493	And when he came to the den,
c81494	he cried with a lamentable voice unto Daniel:
c81495	<i>and</i> the king spake
c81496	and said to Daniel,
c81497	O Daniel, servant of the living God,
c81498	is thy God,
c81499	whom thou servest continually,
c81500	able
c81501	to deliver thee from the lions?
c81502	Then said Daniel unto the king,
c81503	O king,
c81504	live for ever.
c81505	My God hath sent his angel,
c81506	and hath shut the lions' mouths,
c81507	that they have not hurt
c81508	me: forasmuch as before him innocency was found
c81509	in me; and also before
c81510	thee, O king,
c81511	have I done no hurt.
c81512	Then was the king exceeding glad for
c81513	him, and commanded
c81514	that they should take Daniel up out of the den.
c81515	So Daniel was taken up out of the den,
c81516	and no manner of hurt was found
c81517	upon him, because he believed in his God.
c81518	And the king commanded,
c81519	and they brought those men
c81520	which had accused Daniel,
c81521	and they cast <i>them</i> into the den of lions, them, their children, and their wives;
c81522	or ever they came at the bottom of the den.
c81523	and the lions had the mastery
c81524	of them, and brake all their bones in pieces
c81525	Then king Darius wrote unto all people, nations, and languages,
c81526	that dwell in all the earth;
c81527	Peace be multiplied unto you.
c81528	I make a decree,
c81529	That in every dominion of my kingdom men tremble
c81530	and fear before the God of Daniel:
c81531	for he <i>is</i> the living God,
c81532	and stedfast for ever,
c81533	and his kingdom
c81534	<i>that</i> which shall not be destroyed,
c81535	and his dominion <i>shall be even</i> unto the end.
c81536	He delivereth
c81537	and rescueth,
c81538	and he worketh signs and wonders in heaven and in earth,
c81539	who hath delivered Daniel from the power of the lions.
c81540	So this Daniel prospered in the reign of Darius, and in the reign of Cyrus the Persian.
c81541	In the first year of Belshazzar king of Babylon Daniel had a dream
c81542	and visions of his head upon his bed:
c81543	then he wrote the dream,
c81544	<i>and</i> told the sum of the matters.
c81545	Daniel spake
c81546	and said,
c81547	I saw in my vision by night,
c81548	and, behold, the four winds of the heaven strove upon the great sea.
c81549	And four great beasts came up from the sea,
c81550	diverse
c81551	one from another.
c81552	The first <i>was</i> like a lion,
c81553	and had eagle's wings:
c81554	I beheld
c81555	till the wings thereof were plucked,
c81556	and it was lifted up from the earth,
c81557	and made stand upon the feet as a man,
c81558	and a man's heart was given to it.
c81559	And behold another beast, a second, like to a bear,
c81560	and it raised up itself on one side,
c81561	and <i>it had</i> three ribs in the mouth of it between the teeth
c81562	of it: and they said thus
c81563	unto it, Arise,
c81564	devour much flesh.
c81565	After this I beheld,
c81566	and lo another, like a leopard,
c81567	which had upon the back of it four wings of a fowl;
c81568	the beast had also four heads;
c81569	and dominion was given to it.
c81570	After this I saw in the night visions,
c81571	and behold a fourth beast, dreadful and terrible, and strong exceedingly;
c81572	and it had great iron teeth:
c81573	it devoured
c81574	and brake in pieces,
c81575	and stamped the residue with the feet
c81576	of it: and it <i>was</i> diverse from all the beasts
c81577	that <i>were</i> before
c81578	it; and it had ten horns.
c81579	I considered the horns,
c81580	and, behold, there came up among them another little horn,
c81581	before whom there were three of the first horns plucked up by the roots:
c81582	and, behold, in this horn <i>were</i> eyes like the eyes of man,
c81583	and a mouth speaking great things.
c81584	I beheld
c81585	till the thrones were cast down,
c81586	and the Ancient of days did sit,
c81587	whose garment <i>was</i> white as snow,
c81588	and the hair of his head like the pure wool:
c81589	his throne <i>was like</i> the fiery flame,
c81590	<i>and</i> his wheels <i>as</i> burning fire.
c81591	A fiery stream issued
c81592	and came forth from before
c81593	him: thousand thousands ministered
c81594	unto him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before
c81595	him: the judgment was set,
c81596	and the books were opened.
c81597	I beheld then because of the voice of the great words
c81598	which the horn spake:
c81599	I beheld
c81600	<i>even</i> till the beast was slain,
c81601	and his body destroyed,
c81602	and given to the burning flame.
c81603	As concerning the rest of the beasts,
c81604	they had their dominion taken away:
c81605	yet their lives were prolonged for a season and time.
c81606	I saw in the night visions,
c81607	and, behold, <i>one</i> like the Son of man came with the clouds of heaven,
c81608	and came to the Ancient of days,
c81609	and they brought him near before him.
c81610	And there was given him dominion, and glory, and a kingdom,
c81611	that all people, nations, and languages, should serve
c81612	him: his dominion <i>is</i> an everlasting dominion,
c81613	which shall not pass away,
c81614	and his kingdom
c81615	<i>that</i> which shall not be destroyed.
c81616	I Daniel was grieved in my spirit in the midst of <i>my</i> body,
c81617	and the visions of my head troubled me.
c81618	I came near unto one of them that stood by,
c81619	and asked him the truth of all this.
c81620	So he told
c81621	me, and made me know the interpretation of the things.
c81622	These great beasts,
c81623	which are four,
c81624	<i>are</i> four kings,
c81625	<i>which</i> shall arise out of the earth.
c81626	But the saints of the most High shall take the kingdom,
c81627	and possess the kingdom for ever, even for ever and ever.
c81628	Then I would know
c81629	the truth of the fourth beast,
c81630	which was diverse from all
c81631	the others, exceeding dreadful,
c81632	whose teeth <i>were of</i> iron,
c81633	and his nails <i>of</i> brass;
c81634	<i>which</i> devoured,
c81635	brake in pieces,
c81636	and stamped the residue with his feet;
c81637	And of the ten horns
c81638	that <i>were</i> in his head,
c81639	and <i>of</i> the other
c81640	which came up,
c81641	and before whom three fell;
c81642	even <i>of</i> that horn
c81643	that had eyes,
c81644	and a mouth
c81645	that spake very great things,
c81646	whose look <i>was</i> more stout than his fellows.
c81647	I beheld,
c81648	and the same horn made war with the saints,
c81649	and prevailed against them;
c81650	Until the Ancient of days came,
c81651	and judgment was given to the saints of the most High;
c81652	and the time came
c81653	that the saints possessed the kingdom.
c81654	Thus he said,
c81655	The fourth beast shall be the fourth kingdom upon earth,
c81656	which shall be diverse from all kingdoms,
c81657	and shall devour the whole earth,
c81658	and shall tread it down,
c81659	and break it in pieces.
c81660	And the ten horns out of this kingdom
c81661	<i>are</i> ten kings <i>that</i> shall arise:
c81662	and another shall rise after
c81663	them; and he shall be diverse from the first,
c81664	and he shall subdue three kings.
c81665	And he shall speak <i>great</i> words against the most High,
c81666	and shall wear out the saints of the most High,
c81667	and think
c81668	to change times and laws:
c81669	and they shall be given into his hand until a time and times and the dividing of time.
c81670	But the judgment shall sit,
c81671	and they shall take away his dominion,
c81672	to consume
c81673	and to destroy <i>it</i> unto the end.
c81674	And the kingdom and dominion, and the greatness of the kingdom under the whole heaven, shall be given to the people of the saints of the most High,
c81675	whose kingdom <i>is</i> an everlasting kingdom,
c81676	and all dominions shall serve
c81677	and obey him.
c81678	Hitherto <i>is</i> the end of the matter.
c81679	As for me Daniel,
c81680	my cogitations much troubled
c81681	me, and my countenance changed in
c81682	me: but I kept the matter in my heart.
c81683	In the third year of the reign of king Belshazzar a vision appeared unto me, <i>even unto</i> me Daniel,
c81684	after that which appeared unto me at the first.
c81685	And I saw in a vision;
c81686	and it came to pass,
c81687	when I saw,
c81688	that I <i>was</i> at Shushan <i>in</i> the palace,
c81689	which <i>is</i> in the province of Elam;
c81690	and I saw in a vision,
c81691	and I was by the river of Ulai.
c81692	Then I lifted up mine eyes,
c81693	and saw,
c81694	and, behold,
c81695	there stood before the river a ram
c81696	which had <i>two</i> horns:
c81697	and the <i>two</i> horns <i>were</i> high;
c81698	but one <i>was</i> higher than the other,
c81699	and the higher came up last.
c81700	I saw the ram
c81701	pushing westward, and northward, and southward;
c81702	so that no beasts might stand before
c81703	him, neither <i>was there any</i> that could deliver out of his hand;
c81704	but he did according to his will,
c81705	and became great.
c81706	And as I was considering,
c81707	behold, an he goat came from the west on the face of the whole earth,
c81708	and touched not the ground:
c81709	and the goat
c81710	<i>had</i> a notable horn between his eyes.
c81711	And he came to the ram that had <i>two</i> horns,
c81712	which I had seen
c81713	standing before the river,
c81714	and ran unto him in the fury of his power.
c81715	And I saw
c81716	him come close unto the ram,
c81717	and he was moved with choler against
c81718	him, and smote the ram,
c81719	and brake his two horns:
c81720	and there was no power in the ram
c81721	to stand before
c81722	him, but he cast him down to the ground,
c81723	and stamped upon
c81724	him: and there was none that could deliver the ram out of his hand.
c81725	Therefore the he goat waxed very great:
c81727	and when he was strong,
c81728	the great horn was broken;
c81729	and for it came up four notable ones toward the four winds of heaven.
c81730	And out of one of them came forth a little horn,
c81731	which waxed exceeding great, toward the south, and toward the east, and toward the pleasant <i>land.</i>
c81732	And it waxed great, <i>even</i> to the host of heaven;
c81733	and it cast down <i>some</i> of the host and of the stars to the ground,
c81734	and stamped upon them.
c81735	Yea, he magnified <i>himself</i> even to the prince of the host,
c81736	and by him the daily <i>sacrifice</i> was taken away,
c81737	and the place of his sanctuary was cast down.
c81738	And an host was given <i>him</i> against the daily <i>sacrifice</i> by reason of transgression,
c81739	and it cast down the truth to the ground;
c81740	and it practised,
c81741	and prospered.
c81742	Then I heard one saint
c81743	speaking,
c81744	and another saint said unto that certain
c81745	<i>saint</i> which spake,
c81746	How long <i>shall be</i> the vision <i>concerning</i> the daily <i>sacrifice,</i> and the transgression of desolation,
c81747	to give
c81748	both the sanctuary and the host to be trodden under foot?
c81749	And he said unto
c81750	me, Unto two thousand and three hundred days;
c81751	then shall the sanctuary be cleansed.
c81752	And it came to pass,
c81753	when I, <i>even</i> I Daniel, had seen the vision,
c81754	and sought for the meaning,
c81755	then, behold,
c81756	there stood before me as the appearance of a man.
c81757	And I heard a man's voice between <i>the banks of</i> Ulai,
c81758	which called,
c81759	and said,
c81760	Gabriel,
c81761	make this <i>man</i> to understand the vision.
c81762	So he came near where I stood:
c81764	and when he came,
c81765	I was afraid,
c81766	and fell upon my face:
c81767	but he said unto
c81768	me, Understand,
c81769	O son of man:
c81770	for at the time of the end <i>shall be</i> the vision.
c81772	Now as he was speaking with
c81773	me, I was in a deep sleep on my face toward the ground:
c81774	but he touched
c81775	me, and set me upright.
c81776	And he said,
c81777	Behold,
c81778	I will make thee know
c81779	what shall be in the last end of the indignation:
c81780	for at the time appointed the end <i>shall be.</i>
c81781	The ram
c81782	which thou sawest
c81783	having <i>two</i> horns <i>are</i> the kings of Media and Persia.
c81784	And the rough goat <i>is</i> the king of Grecia:
c81785	and the great horn
c81786	that <i>is</i> between his eyes
c81787	<i>is</i> the first king.
c81788	Now that being broken,
c81789	whereas four stood up for
c81790	it, four kingdoms shall stand up out of the nation,
c81791	but not in his power.
c81792	And in the latter time of their kingdom,
c81793	when the transgressors are come to the full,
c81794	a king of fierce countenance, and understanding dark sentences, shall stand up.
c81796	And his power shall be mighty,
c81797	but not by his own power:
c81798	and he shall destroy wonderfully,
c81799	and shall prosper,
c81800	and practise,
c81801	and shall destroy the mighty and the holy people.
c81802	And through his policy
c81803	also he shall cause craft to prosper in his hand;
c81804	and he shall magnify <i>himself</i> in his heart,
c81805	and by peace shall destroy many:
c81806	he shall also stand up against the Prince of princes;
c81807	but he shall be broken without hand.
c81808	And the vision of the evening and the morning
c81809	which was told
c81810	<i>is</i> true:
c81811	wherefore shut thou up the vision;
c81812	for it <i>shall be</i> for many days.
c81813	And I Daniel fainted,
c81814	and was sick <i>certain</i> days;
c81815	afterward I rose up,
c81816	and did the king's business;
c81817	and I was astonished at the vision,
c81818	but none understood <i>it.</i>
c81819	In the first year of Darius the son of Ahasuerus, of the seed of the Medes,
c81820	which was made king over the realm of the Chaldeans;
c81821	In the first year
c81822	of his reign
c81823	I Daniel understood by books
c81824	the number of the years,
c81825	whereof the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah the prophet,
c81826	that he would accomplish seventy years in the desolations of Jerusalem.
c81828	And I set my face unto the Lord God,
c81829	to seek by prayer and supplications, with fasting, and sackcloth, and ashes:
c81830	And I prayed unto the LORD my God,
c81831	and made my confession,
c81832	and said,
c81833	O Lord, the great and dreadful God,
c81834	keeping the covenant and mercy to them that love him, and to them that keep his commandments;
c81835	We have sinned,
c81836	and have committed iniquity,
c81837	and have done wickedly,
c81838	and have rebelled,
c81839	even by departing from thy precepts and from thy judgments:
c81840	Neither have we hearkened unto thy servants the prophets,
c81841	which spake in thy name to our kings, our princes, and our fathers, and to all the people of the land.
c81843	O Lord,
c81844	righteousness
c81845	<i>belongeth</i> unto thee, but unto us confusion of faces,
c81846	as at this day; to the men of Judah, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and unto all Israel,
c81847	<i>that are</i> near,
c81848	and <i>that are</i> far off,
c81849	through all the countries
c81850	whither thou hast driven them, because of their trespass
c81851	that they have trespassed against thee.
c81852	O Lord,
c81853	to us <i>belongeth</i> confusion of face, to our kings, to our princes, and to our fathers,
c81854	because we have sinned against thee.
c81855	To the Lord our God <i>belong</i> mercies and forgivenesses,
c81856	though we have rebelled against him;
c81857	Neither have we obeyed the voice of the LORD our God,
c81858	to walk in his laws,
c81859	which he set before us by his servants the prophets.
c81860	Yea, all Israel have transgressed thy law,
c81861	even by departing,
c81862	that they might not obey thy voice;
c81863	therefore the curse is poured upon us, and the oath
c81864	that <i>is</i> written in the law of Moses the servant of God,
c81865	because we have sinned against him.
c81866	And he hath confirmed his words,
c81867	which he spake against us, and against our judges
c81868	that judged
c81869	us, by bringing upon us a great evil:
c81870	for under the whole heaven hath not been done
c81871	as hath been done upon Jerusalem.
c81872	As <i>it is</i> written in the law of Moses,
c81873	all this evil
c81874	is come upon
c81875	us: yet made we not our prayer before the LORD our God,
c81876	that we might turn from our iniquities,
c81877	and understand thy truth.
c81878	Therefore hath the LORD watched upon the evil,
c81879	and brought it upon
c81880	us: for the LORD our God <i>is</i> righteous in all his works
c81881	which he doeth:
c81882	for we obeyed not his voice.
c81883	And now,
c81884	O Lord our God,
c81885	that hast brought thy people forth out of the land of Egypt with a mighty hand,
c81886	and hast gotten thee renown, as at this day;
c81887	we have sinned,
c81888	we have done wickedly.
c81889	O Lord,
c81890	according to all thy righteousness, I beseech thee, let thine anger and thy fury be turned away from thy city Jerusalem, thy holy mountain:
c81891	because for our sins, and for the iniquities of our fathers, Jerusalem and thy people <i>are become</i> a reproach to all <i>that are</i> about us.
c81892	Now
c81894	therefore, O our God,
c81895	hear the prayer of thy servant, and his supplications,
c81896	and cause thy face to shine upon thy sanctuary that is desolate, for the Lord's sake.
c81897	incline
c81898	O my God,
c81899	thine ear,
c81900	and hear;
c81901	open thine eyes,
c81902	and behold our desolations, and the city
c81903	which is called by thy name:
c81904	for we do not present our supplications before thee for our righteousnesses,
c81905	but for thy great mercies.
c81906	O Lord,
c81907	hear;
c81908	O Lord,
c81909	forgive;
c81910	O Lord,
c81911	hearken
c81912	and do;
c81913	defer not, for thine own sake,
c81914	O my God:
c81915	for thy city and thy people are called by thy name.
c81916	And whiles I <i>was</i> speaking,
c81917	and praying,
c81918	and confessing my sin and the sin of my people Israel,
c81919	and presenting my supplication before the LORD my God for the holy mountain of my God;
c81920	Yea, whiles I <i>was</i> speaking in prayer,
c81921	even the man Gabriel,
c81922	whom I had seen in the vision at the beginning,
c81923	being caused to fly swiftly,
c81924	touched me about the time of the evening oblation.
c81925	And he informed
c81926	<i>me,</i> and talked with
c81927	me, and said,
c81928	O Daniel,
c81929	I am now come forth
c81930	to give thee skill and understanding.
c81931	At the beginning of thy supplications the commandment came forth,
c81932	and I am come
c81933	to shew
c81934	<i>thee;</i> for thou <i>art</i> greatly beloved:
c81935	therefore understand the matter,
c81936	and consider the vision.
c81937	Seventy weeks are determined upon thy people and upon thy holy city,
c81938	to finish the transgression,
c81939	and to make an end of sins,
c81940	and to make reconciliation for iniquity,
c81941	and to bring in everlasting righteousness,
c81942	and to seal up the vision and prophecy,
c81943	and to anoint the most Holy.
c81944	Know
c81945	therefore and understand,
c81946	<i>that</i> from the going forth of the commandment
c81947	to restore
c81948	and to build Jerusalem
c81949	unto the Messiah the Prince <i>shall be</i> seven weeks,
c81950	and threescore and two weeks: the street shall be built again,
c81951	and the wall,
c81952	even in troublous times.
c81953	And after threescore and two weeks shall Messiah be cut off,
c81954	but not
c81955	for himself: and the people of the prince that shall come shall destroy the city and the sanctuary;
c81957	and the end thereof <i>shall be</i> with a flood,
c81958	and unto the end of the war desolations are determined.
c81959	And he shall confirm the covenant with many for one week:
c81960	and in the midst of the week he shall cause the sacrifice and the oblation to cease,
c81961	and for the overspreading of abominations he shall make <i>it</i> desolate,
c81962	even until the consummation,
c81963	and that determined shall be poured upon the desolate.
c81964	In the third year of Cyrus king of Persia a thing was revealed unto Daniel,
c81965	whose name was called Belteshazzar;
c81966	and the thing <i>was</i> true,
c81967	but the time appointed <i>was</i> long:
c81968	and he understood the thing,
c81969	and had understanding of the vision.
c81970	In those days I Daniel was mourning three full weeks.
c81971	I ate no pleasant bread,
c81972	neither came flesh nor wine in my mouth,
c81973	neither did I anoint myself at all,
c81974	till three whole weeks were fulfilled.
c81975	And in the four and twentieth day of the first month,
c81976	as I was by the side of the great river,
c81977	which <i>is</i> Hiddekel;
c81978	Then I lifted up mine eyes,
c81979	and looked,
c81980	and behold
c81981	a certain man
c81982	clothed in linen,
c81983	whose loins <i>were</i> girded with fine gold of Uphaz:
c81984	His body also <i>was</i> like the beryl,
c81985	and his face as the appearance of lightning,
c81986	and his eyes as lamps of fire,
c81987	and his arms and his feet like in colour to polished brass,
c81988	and the voice of his words like the voice of a multitude.
c81989	And I Daniel alone saw the vision:
c81990	for the men
c81991	that were with
c81992	me saw not the vision;
c81993	but a great quaking fell upon
c81994	them, so that they fled
c81995	to hide themselves.
c81996	Therefore I was left alone,
c81997	and saw this great vision,
c81998	and there remained no strength
c81999	in me: for my comeliness was turned in me into corruption,
c82000	and I retained no strength.
c82001	Yet heard I the voice of his words:
c82002	and when I heard the voice of his words,
c82003	then was I in a deep sleep on my face,
c82004	and my face toward the ground.
c82005	And, behold,
c82006	an hand touched
c82007	me, which set me upon my knees and <i>upon</i> the palms of my hands.
c82008	And he said unto
c82009	me, O Daniel, a man greatly beloved,
c82010	understand the words
c82011	that I speak unto
c82012	thee, and stand upright: for unto thee am I now sent.
c82015	And when he had spoken this word unto me, I stood
c82016	trembling.
c82017	Then said he unto
c82018	me, Fear not,
c82019	Daniel:
c82020	for from the first day
c82021	that thou didst set thine heart
c82022	to understand,
c82023	and to chasten thyself before thy God,
c82024	thy words were heard,
c82025	and I am come for thy words.
c82026	But the prince of the kingdom of Persia withstood me one and twenty days:
c82027	but, lo,
c82028	Michael, one of the chief princes, came
c82029	to help
c82030	me; and I remained there with the kings of Persia.
c82031	Now I am come
c82032	to make thee understand
c82033	what shall befall thy people in the latter days:
c82034	for yet the vision <i>is</i> for <i>many</i> days.
c82036	And when he had spoken such words unto
c82037	me, I set my face toward the ground,
c82038	and I became dumb.
c82039	And, behold,
c82040	<i>one</i> like the similitude of the sons of men touched my lips:
c82041	then I opened my mouth,
c82042	and spake,
c82043	and said unto him that stood before
c82044	me, O my lord,
c82045	by the vision my sorrows are turned upon
c82046	me, and I have retained no strength.
c82047	For how can the servant of this my lord
c82048	talk with this my lord?
c82049	for as for me,
c82050	straightway there remained no strength
c82051	in me, neither is there breath left in me.
c82052	Then there came again
c82053	and touched me <i>one</i> like the appearance of a man,
c82054	and he strengthened me,
c82055	And said,
c82056	fear not:
c82057	O man greatly beloved,
c82058	peace
c82059	<i>be</i> unto thee, be strong,
c82060	yea, be strong.
c82062	And when he had spoken unto
c82063	me, I was strengthened,
c82064	and said,
c82065	speak;
c82066	Let my lord
c82067	for thou hast strengthened me.
c82068	Then said
c82069	he, Knowest
c82070	thou wherefore I come unto
c82071	thee? and now will I return
c82072	to fight with the prince of Persia:
c82073	and when I am gone forth,
c82074	lo, the prince of Grecia shall come.
c82075	But I will shew
c82076	thee that which is noted in the scripture of truth:
c82077	and <i>there is</i> none
c82078	that holdeth with me in these things,
c82079	but Michael your prince.
c82080	Also I in the first year of Darius the Mede, <i>even</i> I, stood to confirm and to strengthen him.
c82081	And now
c82082	will I shew thee the truth.
c82083	Behold, there shall stand up yet three kings in Persia;
c82084	and the fourth shall be far richer than <i>they</i> all:
c82085	and by his strength through his riches he shall stir up all against the realm of Grecia.
c82086	And a mighty king shall stand up,
c82087	that shall rule with great dominion,
c82088	and do according to his will.
c82090	And when he shall stand up,
c82091	his kingdom shall be broken,
c82092	and shall be divided toward the four winds of heaven;
c82093	and not to his posterity,
c82094	nor according to his dominion
c82095	which he ruled:
c82096	for his kingdom shall be plucked up,
c82097	even for others beside those.
c82098	And the king of the south shall be strong, and <i>one</i> of his princes;
c82099	and he shall be strong above
c82100	him, and have dominion;
c82101	his dominion <i>shall be</i> a great dominion.
c82102	And in the end of years they shall join themselves together;
c82103	for the king's daughter of the south shall come to the king of the north
c82104	to make an agreement:
c82105	but she shall not retain the power of the arm;
c82106	neither shall he stand,
c82107	nor his arm:
c82108	but she shall be given up, and they that brought her, and he that begat her, and he that strengthened her in <i>these</i> times.
c82109	But out of a branch of her roots shall <i>one</i> stand up in his estate,
c82110	which shall come with an army,
c82111	and shall enter into the fortress of the king of the north,
c82112	and shall deal
c82113	against them, and shall prevail:
c82114	And shall also carry captives into Egypt their gods, with their princes, <i>and</i> with their precious vessels of silver and of gold;
c82115	and he shall continue <i>more</i> years than the king of the north.
c82116	So the king of the south shall come into <i>his</i> kingdom,
c82117	and shall return into his own land.
c82118	But his sons shall be stirred up,
c82119	and shall assemble a multitude of great forces:
c82120	and <i>one</i> shall certainly come,
c82121	and overflow,
c82122	and pass through:
c82123	then shall he return,
c82124	and be stirred up, <i>even</i> to his fortress.
c82125	And the king of the south shall be moved with choler,
c82126	and shall come forth
c82127	and fight with him, <i>even</i> with the king of the north:
c82128	and he shall set forth a great multitude;
c82129	but the multitude shall be given into his hand.
c82130	<i>And</i> when he hath taken away the multitude,
c82131	his heart shall be lifted up;
c82132	and he shall cast down <i>many</i> ten thousands:
c82133	but he shall not be strengthened <i>by it.</i>
c82134	For the king of the north shall return,
c82135	and shall set forth a multitude
c82136	greater than the former,
c82137	and shall certainly come after certain years with a great army and with much riches.
c82138	And in those times there shall many stand up against the king of the south:
c82139	also the robbers of thy people shall exalt themselves
c82140	to establish the vision;
c82141	but they shall fall.
c82142	So the king of the north shall come,
c82143	and cast up a mount,
c82144	and take the most fenced cities:
c82145	and the arms of the south shall not withstand,
c82146	neither his chosen people,
c82147	neither <i>shall there be any</i> strength
c82148	to withstand.
c82149	him shall do
c82150	But he that cometh against
c82151	according to his own will,
c82152	and none shall stand before
c82153	him: and he shall stand in the glorious land,
c82154	which by his hand shall be consumed.
c82155	He shall also set his face
c82156	to enter with the strength of his whole kingdom,
c82157	and upright ones with
c82158	him; thus shall he do:
c82159	and he shall give him the daughter of women,
c82160	corrupting
c82161	her: but she shall not stand
c82162	<i>on his side,</i> neither be for him.
c82163	After this shall he turn his face unto the isles,
c82164	and shall take many:
c82165	but a prince for his own behalf shall cause the reproach offered by him to cease;
c82166	without his own reproach he shall cause <i>it</i> to turn upon him.
c82167	Then he shall turn his face toward the fort of his own land:
c82168	but he shall stumble
c82169	and fall,
c82170	and not be found.
c82171	Then shall stand up in his estate
c82172	a raiser of taxes <i>in</i> the glory of the kingdom:
c82173	but within few days he shall be destroyed,
c82174	neither in anger,
c82175	nor in battle.
c82176	And in his estate shall stand up a vile person,
c82177	to whom they shall not give the honour of the kingdom:
c82178	but he shall come in peaceably,
c82179	and obtain the kingdom by flatteries.
c82180	And with the arms of a flood shall they be overflown from before
c82181	him, and shall be broken;
c82182	yea, also the prince of the covenant.
c82184	And after the league <i>made</i> with
c82185	him he shall work deceitfully:
c82186	for he shall come up,
c82187	and shall become strong with a small people.
c82189	He shall enter peaceably even upon the fattest places of the province;
c82190	and he shall do
c82191	<i>that</i> which his fathers have not done, nor his fathers' fathers;
c82192	he shall scatter among them the prey, and spoil, and riches:
c82193	<i>yea,</i> and he shall forecast his devices against the strong holds,
c82194	even for a time.
c82195	And he shall stir up his power and his courage against the king of the south with a great army;
c82196	and the king of the south shall be stirred up to battle with a very great and mighty army;
c82197	but he shall not stand:
c82198	for they shall forecast devices against him.
c82199	Yea, they that feed of the portion of his meat shall destroy
c82200	him, and his army shall overflow:
c82201	and many shall fall down slain.
c82202	And both these kings'
c82203	hearts <i>shall be</i> to do mischief,
c82204	and they shall speak lies at one table;
c82205	but it shall not prosper:
c82206	for yet the end <i>shall be</i> at the time appointed.
c82207	Then shall he return into his land with great riches;
c82208	and his heart <i>shall be</i> against the holy covenant;
c82209	and he shall do
c82210	<i>exploits,</i> and return to his own land.
c82211	At the time appointed he shall return,
c82212	and come toward the south;
c82213	but it shall not be as the former, or as the latter.
c82214	For the ships of Chittim shall come
c82215	against him: therefore he shall be grieved,
c82216	and return,
c82217	and have indignation against the holy covenant:
c82218	so shall he do;
c82219	he shall even return,
c82220	and have intelligence with them that forsake the holy covenant.
c82221	And arms shall stand on his part,
c82222	and they shall pollute the sanctuary of strength,
c82223	and shall take away the daily
c82224	<i>sacrifice,</i> and they shall place the abomination
c82225	that maketh desolate.
c82226	And such as do wickedly against the covenant shall he corrupt by flatteries:
c82227	but the people that do know their God shall be strong,
c82228	and do <i>exploits.</i>
c82229	And they that understand among the people shall instruct many:
c82230	yet they shall fall by the sword, and by flame, by captivity, and by spoil, <i>many</i> days.
c82232	Now when they shall fall,
c82233	they shall be holpen with a little help:
c82234	but many shall cleave to them with flatteries.
c82235	And <i>some</i> of them of understanding shall fall,
c82236	to try
c82237	them, and to purge,
c82238	and to make <i>them</i> white,
c82239	<i>even</i> to the time of the end:
c82240	because <i>it is</i> yet for a time appointed.
c82241	And the king shall do according to his will;
c82242	and he shall exalt himself,
c82243	and magnify himself above every god,
c82244	and shall speak marvellous things against the God of gods,
c82245	and shall prosper
c82246	till the indignation be accomplished:
c82247	for that that is determined shall be done.
c82248	Neither shall he regard the God of his fathers,
c82249	nor the desire of women, nor regard any god:
c82251	for he shall magnify himself above all.
c82252	But in his estate shall he honour the God of forces:
c82253	and a god
c82254	whom his fathers knew not
c82255	shall he honour with gold, and silver, and with precious stones, and pleasant things.
c82256	Thus shall he do in the most strong holds with a strange god,
c82257	whom he shall acknowledge
c82258	<i>and</i> increase with glory:
c82259	and he shall cause them to rule over many,
c82260	and shall divide the land for gain.
c82261	And at the time of the end shall the king of the south push at
c82262	him: and the king of the north shall come against him like a whirlwind, with chariots, and with horsemen, and with many ships;
c82263	and he shall enter into the countries,
c82264	and shall overflow
c82265	and pass over.
c82266	He shall enter also into the glorious land,
c82267	and many <i>countries</i> shall be overthrown:
c82268	but these shall escape out of his hand,
c82269	<i>even</i> Edom, and Moab, and the chief of the children of Ammon.
c82270	He shall stretch forth his hand also upon the countries:
c82271	and the land of Egypt shall not escape.
c82272	But he shall have power over the treasures of gold and of silver, and over all the precious things of Egypt:
c82273	and the Libyans and the Ethiopians <i>shall be</i> at his steps.
c82274	But tidings out of the east and out of the north shall trouble
c82275	him: therefore he shall go forth with great fury
c82276	to destroy,
c82277	and utterly to make away many.
c82278	And he shall plant the tabernacles of his palace between the seas in the glorious holy mountain;
c82279	yet he shall come to his end,
c82280	and none shall help him.
c82281	And at that time shall Michael stand up, the great prince
c82282	which standeth for the children of thy people:
c82283	and there shall be a time of trouble,
c82284	such as never was
c82285	since there was a nation
c82286	<i>even</i> to that same time:
c82287	and at that time thy people shall be delivered, every one
c82288	that shall be found
c82289	written in the book.
c82290	And many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake,
c82291	some to everlasting life,
c82292	and some to shame <i>and</i> everlasting contempt.
c82293	And they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament;
c82294	and they that turn many to righteousness as the stars for ever and ever.
c82295	But thou,
c82296	O Daniel,
c82297	shut up the words,
c82298	and seal the book, <i>even</i> to the time of the end:
c82299	many shall run to and fro,
c82300	and knowledge shall be increased.
c82301	Then I Daniel looked,
c82302	and, behold,
c82303	there stood other two,
c82304	the one on this side of the bank of the river,
c82305	and the other on that side of the bank of the river.
c82306	And <i>one</i> said to the man clothed in linen,
c82307	which <i>was</i> upon the waters of the river,
c82308	How long <i>shall it be to</i> the end of these wonders?
c82309	And I heard the man clothed in linen,
c82310	which <i>was</i> upon the waters of the river,
c82311	when he held up his right hand and his left hand unto heaven,
c82312	and sware by him that liveth for ever
c82313	that <i>it shall be</i> for a time, times, and an half;
c82315	and when he shall have accomplished
c82316	to scatter the power of the holy people,
c82317	all these <i>things</i> shall be finished.
c82318	And I heard,
c82319	but I understood not:
c82320	then said
c82321	I, O my Lord,
c82322	what <i>shall be</i> the end of these <i>things?</i>
c82323	And he said,
c82324	Go thy way,
c82325	Daniel:
c82326	for the words <i>are</i> closed up
c82327	and sealed till the time of the end.
c82329	and made white, and tried;
c82330	Many shall be purified,
c82331	but the wicked shall do wickedly:
c82332	and none of the wicked shall understand;
c82333	but the wise shall understand.
c82334	And from the time
c82335	<i>that</i> the daily <i>sacrifice</i> shall be taken away,
c82336	and the abomination that maketh desolate set up,
c82337	<i>there shall be</i> a thousand two hundred and ninety days.
c82338	Blessed
c82339	<i>is</i> he that waiteth,
c82340	and cometh to the thousand three hundred and five and thirty days.
c82341	But go thou thy way till the end
c82342	<i>be:</i> for thou shalt rest,
c82343	and stand in thy lot at the end of the days.
c82344	Now in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia,
c82345	that the word of the LORD by the mouth of Jeremiah might be fulfilled,
c82346	the LORD stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia,
c82347	that he made a proclamation throughout all his kingdom,
c82348	and <i>put it</i> also in writing,
c82349	saying,
c82350	Thus saith Cyrus king of Persia,
c82351	The LORD God of heaven hath given me all the kingdoms of the earth;
c82352	and he hath charged
c82353	me to build him an house at Jerusalem,
c82354	which <i>is</i> in Judah.
c82355	Who <i>is there</i> among you of all his people?
c82356	his God be with
c82357	him, and let him go up to Jerusalem,
c82358	which <i>is</i> in Judah,
c82359	and build the house of the LORD God of Israel,
c82360	(he <i>is</i> the God,)
c82361	which <i>is</i> in Jerusalem.
c82362	And whosoever
c82363	remaineth in any place
c82364	where he sojourneth,
c82365	let the men of his place help him with silver, and with gold, and with goods, and with beasts, beside the freewill offering for the house of God
c82366	that <i>is</i> in Jerusalem.
c82367	Then rose up the chief of the fathers of Judah and Benjamin, and the priests, and the Levites, with all
c82368	<i>them</i> whose spirit God had raised,
c82369	to go up
c82370	to build the house of the LORD
c82371	which <i>is</i> in Jerusalem.
c82372	And all they that <i>were</i> about them strengthened their hands with vessels of silver, with gold, with goods, and with beasts, and with precious things, beside all
c82373	<i>that</i> was willingly offered.
c82374	Also Cyrus the king brought forth the vessels of the house of the LORD,
c82375	which Nebuchadnezzar had brought forth out of Jerusalem,
c82376	and had put them in the house of his gods;
c82377	Even those did Cyrus king of Persia bring forth by the hand of Mithredath the treasurer,
c82378	and numbered them unto Sheshbazzar, the prince of Judah.
c82379	And this <i>is</i> the number
c82380	of them: thirty chargers of gold,
c82381	a thousand chargers of silver,
c82382	nine and twenty knives,
c82383	Thirty basons of gold,
c82384	silver basons of a second <i>sort</i> four hundred and ten,
c82385	<i>and</i> other vessels a thousand.
c82386	All the vessels of gold and of silver <i>were</i> five thousand and four hundred.
c82387	All <i>these</i> did Sheshbazzar bring up
c82388	with <i>them of</i> the captivity that were brought up from Babylon unto Jerusalem.
c82389	Now these <i>are</i> the children of the province
c82390	that went up out of the captivity, of those which had been carried away,
c82391	whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away unto Babylon,
c82392	and came again unto Jerusalem and Judah,
c82393	every one unto his city;
c82394	Which came with Zerubbabel: Jeshua, Nehemiah, Seraiah, Reelaiah, Mordecai, Bilshan, Mispar, Bigvai, Rehum, Baanah.
c82395	The number of the men of the people of Israel:
c82396	The children of Parosh, two thousand an hundred seventy and two.
c82397	The children of Shephatiah, three hundred seventy and two.
c82398	The children of Arah, seven hundred seventy and five.

c82428	The children of Senaah, three thousand and six hundred and thirty.
c82429	The priests:
c82430	the children of Jedaiah, of the house of Jeshua, nine hundred seventy and three.
c82431	The children of Immer, a thousand fifty and two.
c82432	The children of Pashur, a thousand two hundred forty and seven.
c82433	The children of Harim, a thousand and seventeen.
c82434	The Levites:
c82435	the children of Jeshua and Kadmiel, of the children of Hodaviah, seventy and four.
c82436	The singers:
c82437	the children of Asaph, an hundred twenty and eight.
c82438	The children of the porters: the children of Shallum, the children of Ater, the children of Talmon, the children of Akkub, the children of Hatita, the children of Shobai,
c82439	<i>in</i> all an hundred thirty and nine.
c82440	The Nethinims: the children of Ziha, the children of Hasupha, the children of Tabbaoth,
c82441	The children of Keros, the children of Siaha, the children of Padon,
c82442	The children of Lebanah, the children of Hagabah, the children of Akkub,
c82443	The children of Hagab, the children of Shalmai, the children of Hanan,
c82444	The children of Giddel, the children of Gahar, the children of Reaiah,
c82445	The children of Rezin, the children of Nekoda, the children of Gazzam,
c82446	The children of Uzza, the children of Paseah, the children of Besai,
c82447	The children of Asnah, the children of Mehunim, the children of Nephusim,
c82448	The children of Bakbuk, the children of Hakupha, the children of Harhur,
c82449	The children of Bazluth, the children of Mehida, the children of Harsha,
c82450	The children of Barkos, the children of Sisera, the children of Thamah,
c82451	The children of Neziah, the children of Hatipha.
c82452	The children of Solomon's servants: the children of Sotai, the children of Sophereth, the children of Peruda,
c82453	The children of Jaalah, the children of Darkon, the children of Giddel,
c82454	The children of Shephatiah, the children of Hattil, the children of Pochereth of Zebaim, the children of Ami.
c82455	All the Nethinims, and the children of Solomon's servants, <i>were</i> three hundred ninety and two.
c82456	And these
c82457	<i>were</i> they which went up from Telmelah, Telharsa, Cherub, Addan, <i>and</i> Immer:
c82458	but they could not
c82459	shew
c82460	their father's house, and their seed,
c82461	whether they <i>were</i> of Israel:
c82462	The children of Delaiah, the children of Tobiah, the children of Nekoda, six hundred fifty and two.
c82463	And of the children of the priests: the children of Habaiah, the children of Koz, the children of Barzillai;
c82464	which took a wife of the daughters of Barzillai the Gileadite,
c82465	and was called after their name:
c82466	These sought their register
c82467	<i>among</i> those that were reckoned by genealogy,
c82468	but they were not found:
c82469	therefore were they, as polluted, put from the priesthood.
c82470	And the Tirshatha said
c82471	unto them, that they should not eat of the most holy things,
c82472	till there stood up a priest with Urim and with Thummim.
c82473	The whole congregation together <i>was</i> forty and two thousand three hundred <i>and</i> threescore,
c82474	Beside their servants and their maids, of whom <i>there were</i> seven thousand three hundred thirty and seven:
c82475	and <i>there were</i> among them two hundred singing men and singing women.
c82476	Their horses <i>were</i> seven hundred thirty and six;
c82477	their mules, two hundred forty and five;
c82478	Their camels, four hundred thirty and five;
c82479	<i>their</i> asses, six thousand seven hundred and twenty.
c82480	And <i>some</i> of the chief of the fathers,
c82481	when they came to the house of the LORD
c82482	which <i>is</i> at Jerusalem,
c82483	offered freely for the house of God
c82484	to set it up in his place:
c82485	They gave after their ability unto the treasure of the work threescore and one thousand drams of gold, and five thousand pound of silver, and one hundred priests' garments.
c82486	So the priests, and the Levites, and <i>some</i> of the people, and the singers, and the porters, and the Nethinims, dwelt in their cities,
c82487	and all Israel in their cities.
c82488	And when the seventh month was come,
c82489	and the children of Israel <i>were</i> in the cities,
c82490	the people gathered themselves together as one man to Jerusalem.
c82491	Then stood up Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and his brethren the priests, and Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and his brethren,
c82492	and builded the altar of the God of Israel,
c82493	to offer burnt offerings thereon,
c82494	as <i>it is</i> written in the law of Moses the man of God.
c82495	And they set the altar upon his bases;
c82496	for fear <i>was</i> upon them because of the people of those countries:
c82497	and they offered burnt offerings thereon unto the LORD,
c82498	<i>even</i> burnt offerings morning and evening.
c82499	They kept also the feast of tabernacles, as <i>it is</i> written,
c82500	and <i>offered</i> the daily burnt offerings by number, according to the custom, as the duty of every day required;
c82501	And afterward <i>offered</i> the continual burnt offering,
c82502	both of the new moons, and of all the set feasts of the LORD that were consecrated,
c82503	and of every one
c82504	that willingly offered a freewill offering unto the LORD.
c82505	From the first day of the seventh month began
c82506	they to offer burnt offerings unto the LORD.
c82507	But the foundation of the temple of the LORD was not <i>yet</i> laid.
c82508	They gave money also unto the masons, and to the carpenters;
c82509	and meat, and drink, and oil, unto them of Zidon, and to them of Tyre,
c82510	to bring cedar trees from Lebanon to the sea of Joppa, according to the grant that they had of Cyrus king of Persia.
c82511	Now in the second year
c82512	of their coming unto the house of God at Jerusalem,
c82513	in the second month, began Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and the remnant of their brethren the priests and the Levites, and all
c82514	they that were come out of the captivity unto Jerusalem;
c82515	and appointed the Levites, from twenty years old and upward,
c82516	to set forward the work of the house of the LORD.
c82517	Then stood Jeshua <i>with</i> his sons and his brethren, Kadmiel and his sons, the sons of Judah, together,
c82518	to set
c82519	forward the workmen in the house of God:
c82520	the sons of Henadad, <i>with</i> their sons and their brethren the Levites.
c82521	And when the builders laid the foundation of the temple of the LORD,
c82522	they set the priests
c82523	in their apparel
c82524	with trumpets,
c82525	and the Levites the sons of Asaph with cymbals,
c82526	to praise the LORD, after the ordinance of David king of Israel.
c82527	And they sang together by course
c82528	in praising
c82529	and giving thanks unto the LORD;
c82530	because <i>he is</i> good,
c82531	for his mercy <i>endureth</i> for ever toward Israel.
c82532	And all the people shouted with a great shout,
c82533	when they praised the LORD,
c82534	because the foundation of the house of the LORD was laid.
c82535	But many of the priests and Levites and chief of the fathers, <i>who were</i> ancient men,
c82536	that had seen the first house, when the foundation of this house was laid
c82537	before their eyes,
c82538	wept with a loud voice;
c82539	and many shouted aloud for joy:
c82541	So that the people could not discern the noise of the shout of joy from the noise of the weeping of the people:
c82542	for the people shouted with a loud shout,
c82543	and the noise was heard afar off.
c82544	Now when the adversaries of Judah and Benjamin heard
c82545	that the children of the captivity builded the temple unto the LORD God of Israel;
c82546	Then they came to Zerubbabel, and to the chief of the fathers,
c82547	and said
c82548	unto them, Let us build with
c82549	you: for we seek your God,
c82550	as ye <i>do;</i> and we do sacrifice unto him since the days of Esarhaddon king of Assur,
c82551	which brought us up hither.
c82552	But Zerubbabel, and Jeshua, and the rest of the chief of the fathers of Israel, said
c82553	unto them, Ye have nothing
c82554	to do with us to build an house unto our God;
c82555	but we ourselves together will build unto the LORD God of Israel,
c82556	as king Cyrus the king of Persia hath commanded us.
c82557	Then the people of the land
c82558	weakened the hands of the people of Judah,
c82559	and troubled
c82560	them in building,
c82561	And hired counsellors against
c82562	them, to frustrate their purpose,
c82563	all the days of Cyrus king of Persia, even until the reign of Darius king of Persia.
c82564	And in the reign of Ahasuerus, in the beginning of his reign, wrote they <i>unto him</i> an accusation against the inhabitants of Judah and Jerusalem.
c82565	And in the days of Artaxerxes wrote Bishlam, Mithredath, Tabeel, and the rest of their companions, unto Artaxerxes king of Persia;
c82566	and the writing of the letter <i>was</i> written in the Syrian tongue,
c82567	and interpreted in the Syrian tongue.
c82568	Rehum the chancellor and Shimshai the scribe wrote a letter against Jerusalem to Artaxerxes the king in this sort:
c82569	Then <i>wrote</i> Rehum the chancellor, and Shimshai the scribe, and the rest of their companions; the Dinaites, the Apharsathchites, the Tarpelites, the Apharsites, the Archevites, the Babylonians, the Susanchites, the Dehavites, <i>and</i> the Elamites,
c82570	And the rest of the nations
c82571	whom the great and noble Asnappar brought over,
c82572	and set in the cities of Samaria, and the rest <i>that are</i> on this side the river,
c82573	and at such a time.
c82574	This <i>is</i> the copy of the letter
c82575	that they sent unto
c82576	him, <i>even</i> unto Artaxerxes the king; Thy servants the men on this side the river,
c82577	and at such a time.
c82578	Be it known unto the king,
c82579	that the Jews which
c82580	came up from
c82581	thee to us are come unto Jerusalem,
c82582	building the rebellious and the bad city,
c82583	and have set up the walls
c82584	<i>thereof,</i> and joined the foundations.
c82585	Be it known now unto the king,
c82586	that,
c82587	if this city be builded,
c82588	and the walls set up
c82589	<i>again, then</i> will they not pay toll, tribute, and custom,
c82590	and <i>so</i> thou shalt endamage the revenue of the kings.
c82591	Now
c82592	because we have maintenance from <i>the king's</i> palace,
c82593	the king's dishonour,
c82594	and it was not meet
c82595	for us to see
c82596	therefore have we sent
c82597	and certified the king;
c82598	That search may be made in the book of the records of thy fathers:
c82599	so shalt thou find in the book of the records,
c82600	and know
c82601	that this city <i>is</i> a rebellious city,
c82602	and hurtful unto kings and provinces,
c82603	and that they have moved sedition within the same of old time:
c82604	for which cause was this city destroyed.
c82605	We certify the king
c82606	that,
c82607	if this city be builded
c82608	<i>again,</i> and the walls thereof set up,
c82609	by this means thou shalt have no portion on this side the river.
c82610	<i>Then</i> sent the king an answer
c82611	unto Rehum the chancellor, and <i>to</i> Shimshai the scribe, and <i>to</i> the rest of their companions
c82612	that dwell in Samaria,
c82613	and <i>unto</i> the rest beyond the river,
c82614	Peace,
c82615	and at such a time.
c82616	The letter
c82617	which ye sent unto
c82618	us hath been plainly read before me.
c82619	And I commanded, and search hath been made,
c82621	and it is found
c82622	that this city of old time hath made insurrection against kings,
c82623	and <i>that</i> rebellion and sedition have been made therein.
c82624	There have been mighty kings also over Jerusalem,
c82625	which have ruled over all <i>countries</i> beyond the river;
c82626	and toll, tribute, and custom, was paid unto them.
c82627	Give ye now commandment
c82628	to cause these men to cease,
c82629	and that this city be not builded,
c82630	until <i>another</i> commandment shall be given from me.
c82631	Take heed
c82632	now that ye fail not to do this:
c82633	why should damage grow
c82634	to the hurt of the kings?
c82635	Now
c82636	when the copy of king Artaxerxes' letter <i>was</i> read before Rehum, and Shimshai the scribe, and their companions,
c82637	they went up in haste to Jerusalem unto the Jews,
c82638	and made them to cease by force and power.
c82639	Then ceased the work of the house of God
c82640	which <i>is</i> at Jerusalem.
c82641	So it ceased unto the second year of the reign of Darius king of Persia.
c82642	Then the prophets, Haggai the prophet, and Zechariah the son of Iddo, prophesied unto the Jews
c82643	that <i>were</i> in Judah and Jerusalem
c82644	in the name of the God of Israel, <i>even</i> unto them.
c82645	Then rose up Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua the son of Jozadak,
c82646	and began
c82647	to build the house of God
c82648	which <i>is</i> at Jerusalem:
c82649	and with them <i>were</i> the prophets of God
c82650	helping them.
c82651	At the same time came to them Tatnai, governor on this side the river, and Shetharboznai, and their companions,
c82652	and said thus
c82653	unto them, Who hath commanded
c82654	you to build this house,
c82655	and to make up this wall?
c82656	Then said we unto them after this manner,
c82657	What are the names of the men
c82658	that make this building?
c82659	But the eye of their God was upon the elders of the Jews,
c82660	that they could not cause them to cease,
c82661	till the matter came to Darius:
c82662	and then they returned answer by letter concerning this <i>matter.</i>
c82663	The copy of the letter
c82664	that Tatnai, governor on this side the river, and Shetharboznai, and his companions the Apharsachites, which <i>were</i> on this side the river, sent
c82666	unto Darius the king:
c82667	They sent a letter unto
c82668	him, wherein was written thus;
c82669	Unto Darius the king, all peace.
c82670	Be it known unto the king,
c82671	that we went into the province of Judea, to the house of the great God,
c82672	which is builded with great stones,
c82673	and timber is laid in the walls,
c82674	and this work goeth fast on,
c82675	and prospereth in their hands.
c82676	Then asked we those elders,
c82677	<i>and</i> said unto them thus,
c82678	Who commanded
c82679	you to build this house,
c82680	and to make up these walls?
c82681	We asked their names also,
c82682	to certify
c82683	thee, that we might write the names of the men
c82684	that <i>were</i> the chief of them.
c82685	And thus they returned us answer,
c82686	saying,
c82687	We are the servants of the God of heaven and earth,
c82688	and build the house
c82689	that was builded these many years ago,
c82690	which a great king of Israel builded
c82691	and set up.
c82692	But
c82693	after that our fathers had provoked the God of heaven unto wrath,
c82694	he gave them into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, the Chaldean,
c82695	this house,
c82696	who destroyed
c82697	and carried the people away into Babylon.
c82698	But in the first year of Cyrus the king of Babylon <i>the same</i> king Cyrus made a decree
c82699	to build this house of God.
c82700	And the vessels also of gold and silver of the house of God,
c82702	which Nebuchadnezzar took out of the temple
c82703	that <i>was</i> in Jerusalem,
c82704	and brought them into the temple
c82705	of Babylon,
c82706	those did Cyrus the king take out of the temple
c82707	of Babylon,
c82708	and they were delivered unto <i>one,</i> whose name <i>was</i> Sheshbazzar,
c82709	whom he had made governor;
c82710	And said
c82711	unto him, Take these vessels,
c82712	go,
c82713	carry them into the temple
c82714	that <i>is</i> in Jerusalem,
c82715	and let the house of God be builded in his place.
c82716	Then came the same Sheshbazzar,
c82717	<i>and</i> laid the foundation of the house of God
c82718	which <i>is</i> in Jerusalem:
c82719	and since that time even until now hath it been in building,
c82720	and <i>yet</i> it is not finished.
c82721	Now
c82722	therefore, if <i>it seem</i> good to the king,
c82723	let there be search made in the king's treasure house, which <i>is</i> there
c82724	at Babylon, whether it be <i>so,</i> that
c82726	a decree was made of Cyrus the king
c82727	to build this house of God at Jerusalem,
c82728	and let the king send his pleasure to us concerning this matter.
c82729	Then Darius the king made a decree,
c82730	and search was made in the house of the rolls,
c82731	where the treasures were laid up in Babylon.
c82732	And there was found at Achmetha, in the palace
c82733	that <i>is</i> in the province of the Medes,
c82734	a roll,
c82735	and therein <i>was</i> a record thus written:
c82737	In the first year of Cyrus the king <i>the same</i> Cyrus the king made a decree
c82738	<i>concerning</i> the house of God at Jerusalem,
c82739	Let the house be builded, the place
c82740	where they offered sacrifices,
c82741	and let the foundations thereof be strongly laid;
c82742	the height thereof threescore cubits,
c82743	<i>and</i> the breadth thereof threescore cubits;
c82744	rows
c82745	of great stones,
c82746	<i>With</i> three
c82747	and a row of new timber:
c82748	and let the expenses be given out of the king's house:
c82749	And also let the golden and silver vessels of the house of God, which
c82750	Nebuchadnezzar took forth out of the temple which
c82751	<i>is</i> at Jerusalem, and brought unto Babylon,
c82753	be restored,
c82754	and brought again unto the temple which
c82755	<i>is</i> at Jerusalem,
c82756	<i>every one</i> to his place,
c82757	and place <i>them</i> in the house of God.
c82758	Now
c82759	<i>therefore,</i> Tatnai, governor beyond the river, Shetharboznai, and your companions the Apharsachites,
c82760	which <i>are</i> beyond the river,
c82761	be ye far from thence:
c82762	Let the work of this house of God alone;
c82763	let the governor of the Jews and the elders of the Jews build this house of God in his place.
c82764	Moreover I make a decree what ye shall do to the elders of these Jews
c82766	for the building of this house of God: that of the king's goods,
c82767	<i>even</i> of the tribute beyond the river, forthwith expenses be given unto these men,
c82768	that they be not
c82769	hindered.
c82770	And that which they have need of,
c82771	both young bullocks, and rams, and lambs, for the burnt offerings of the God of heaven, wheat, salt, wine, and oil, according to the appointment of the priests
c82772	which <i>are</i> at Jerusalem,
c82773	let it be given them day by day
c82774	without fail:
c82775	That they may offer sacrifices of sweet savours unto the God of heaven,
c82776	and pray for the life of the king, and of his sons.
c82777	Also I have made a decree, that whosoever
c82779	shall alter this word,
c82780	let timber be pulled down from his house,
c82781	and being set up,
c82782	let him be hanged thereon;
c82783	and let his house be made a dunghill for this.
c82784	And the God
c82785	that hath caused his name to dwell there
c82786	destroy all kings and people,
c82787	that shall put to their hand
c82788	to alter
c82789	<i>and</i> to destroy this house of God
c82790	which <i>is</i> at Jerusalem.
c82791	I Darius have made a decree;
c82792	let it be done with speed.
c82793	Then Tatnai, governor on this side the river, Shetharboznai, and their companions,
c82794	according to that which Darius the king had sent,
c82795	so they did speedily.
c82796	And the elders of the Jews builded,
c82797	and they prospered through the prophesying of Haggai the prophet and Zechariah the son of Iddo.
c82798	And they builded,
c82799	and finished <i>it,</i> according to the commandment of the God of Israel, and according to the commandment of Cyrus, and Darius, and Artaxerxes king of Persia.
c82800	And this house was finished on the third day of the month Adar,
c82801	which was in the sixth year of the reign of Darius the king.
c82802	And the children of Israel, the priests, and the Levites, and the rest of the children of the captivity, kept the dedication of this house of God with joy,
c82803	And offered at the dedication of this house of God an hundred bullocks, two hundred rams, four hundred lambs;
c82804	and for a sin offering for all Israel, twelve he goats, according to the number of the tribes of Israel.
c82805	And they set the priests in their divisions,
c82806	and the Levites in their courses, for the service of God,
c82807	which <i>is</i> at Jerusalem;
c82808	as it is written in the book of Moses.
c82809	And the children of the captivity kept the passover upon the fourteenth <i>day</i> of the first month.
c82810	For the priests and the Levites were purified together,
c82811	all of them <i>were</i> pure,
c82812	and killed the passover for all the children of the captivity, and for their brethren the priests, and for themselves.
c82813	And the children of Israel, which were come again out of captivity,
c82815	and all
c82816	such as had separated themselves unto them from the filthiness of the heathen of the land,
c82817	to seek the LORD God of Israel, did eat,
c82818	And kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days with joy:
c82819	for the LORD had made them joyful,
c82820	and turned the heart of the king of Assyria unto
c82821	them, to strengthen their hands in the work of the house of God, the God of Israel.
c82822	Now after these things, in the reign of Artaxerxes king of Persia, Ezra the son of Seraiah, the son of Azariah, the son of Hilkiah,
c82823	The son of Shallum, the son of Zadok, the son of Ahitub,
c82824	The son of Amariah, the son of Azariah, the son of Meraioth,
c82825	The son of Zerahiah, the son of Uzzi, the son of Bukki,
c82826	The son of Abishua, the son of Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the chief priest:
c82827	This Ezra went up from Babylon;
c82828	and he <i>was</i> a ready scribe in the law of Moses,
c82829	which the LORD God of Israel had given:
c82830	and the king granted him all his request, according to the hand of the LORD his God upon him.
c82831	And there went up <i>some</i> of the children of Israel, and of the priests, and the Levites, and the singers, and the porters, and the Nethinims, unto Jerusalem, in the seventh year of Artaxerxes the king.
c82832	And he came to Jerusalem in the fifth month,
c82833	which <i>was</i> in the seventh year of the king.
c82834	For upon the first <i>day</i> of the first month began he to go up from Babylon,
c82835	and on the first <i>day</i> of the fifth month came he to Jerusalem, according to the good hand of his God upon him.
c82836	For Ezra had prepared his heart
c82837	to seek the law of the LORD,
c82838	and to do
c82839	<i>it,</i> and to teach in Israel statutes and judgments.
c82840	Now this <i>is</i> the copy of the letter
c82841	that the king Artaxerxes gave unto Ezra the priest, the scribe, <i>even</i> a scribe of the words of the commandments of the LORD, and of his statutes to Israel.
c82842	Artaxerxes, king of kings, unto Ezra the priest, a scribe of the law of the God of heaven,
c82843	perfect
c82844	<i>peace,</i> and at such a time.
c82845	I make a decree, that all they of
c82846	the people of Israel, and <i>of</i> his priests and Levites, in my realm, which are minded of their own freewill
c82847	to go up to Jerusalem,
c82848	go with thee.
c82849	Forasmuch as thou art sent of the king, and of his seven counsellors,
c82850	to enquire concerning Judah and Jerusalem, according to the law of thy God
c82851	which <i>is</i> in thine hand;
c82852	And to carry the silver and gold,
c82853	which the king and his counsellors have freely offered unto the God of Israel,
c82854	whose habitation <i>is</i> in Jerusalem,
c82855	And all the silver and gold
c82856	that thou canst find in all the province of Babylon,
c82857	with the freewill offering of the people, and of the priests,
c82858	offering willingly for the house of their God
c82859	which <i>is</i> in Jerusalem:
c82860	That thou mayest buy speedily with this money bullocks, rams, lambs, with their meat offerings and their drink offerings,
c82861	and offer them upon the altar of the house of your God
c82862	which <i>is</i> in Jerusalem.
c82863	And whatsoever
c82864	shall seem good to thee, and to thy brethren,
c82865	to do with the rest of the silver and the gold,
c82866	that do after the will of your God.
c82867	The vessels
c82868	also that are given thee for the service of the house of thy God,
c82869	<i>those</i> deliver thou before the God of Jerusalem.
c82870	And whatsoever more shall be needful for the house of thy God,
c82871	which thou shalt have occasion
c82872	to bestow,
c82873	bestow <i>it</i> out of the king's treasure house.
c82874	And I, <i>even</i> I Artaxerxes the king, do make a decree to all the treasurers
c82875	which <i>are</i> beyond the river,
c82876	that whatsoever
c82877	Ezra the priest, the scribe of the law of the God of heaven, shall require
c82878	of you, it be done speedily,
c82879	Unto an hundred talents of silver, and to an hundred measures of wheat, and to an hundred baths of wine, and to an hundred baths of oil, and salt without prescribing <i>how much.</i>
c82880	Whatsoever
c82881	is commanded by the God of heaven,
c82882	let it be diligently done for the house of the God of heaven:
c82883	for why should there be wrath against the realm of the king and his sons?
c82884	Also we certify
c82885	you, that touching any of the priests and Levites, singers, porters, Nethinims, or ministers of this house of God,
c82887	it shall not be lawful
c82888	to impose toll, tribute, or custom, upon them.
c82889	And thou,
c82890	Ezra,
c82891	after the wisdom of thy God,
c82892	that <i>is</i> in thine hand,
c82893	set magistrates and judges,
c82894	which may judge all the people
c82895	that <i>are</i> beyond the river,
c82896	all
c82897	such as know the laws of thy God;
c82898	and teach ye them that know <i>them</i> not.
c82900	And whosoever
c82901	will not do the law of thy God, and the law of the king,
c82902	let judgment be executed speedily upon
c82903	him, whether <i>it be</i> unto death,
c82904	or to banishment,
c82905	or to confiscation of goods, or to imprisonment.
c82906	Blessed <i>be</i> the LORD God of our fathers,
c82907	which hath put <i>such a thing</i> as this in the king's heart,
c82908	to beautify the house of the LORD
c82909	which <i>is</i> in Jerusalem:
c82910	And hath extended mercy unto me before the king, and his counsellors, and before all the king's mighty princes.
c82911	And I was strengthened as the hand of the LORD my God <i>was</i> upon
c82912	me, and I gathered together out of Israel chief men
c82913	to go up with me.
c82914	These <i>are</i> now the chief of their fathers,
c82915	and <i>this is</i> the genealogy
c82916	of them that went up with me from Babylon, in the reign of Artaxerxes the king.
c82917	Of the sons of Phinehas; Gershom:
c82918	of the sons of Ithamar; Daniel:
c82919	of the sons of David; Hattush.
c82920	Of the sons of Shechaniah, of the sons of Pharosh; Zechariah:
c82921	and with him were reckoned by genealogy of the males an hundred and fifty.
c82922	Of the sons of Pahathmoab; Elihoenai the son of Zerahiah,
c82923	and with him two hundred males.
c82924	Of the sons of Shechaniah; the son of Jahaziel,
c82925	and with him three hundred males.
c82926	Of the sons also of Adin; Ebed the son of Jonathan,
c82927	and with him fifty males.
c82928	And of the sons of Elam; Jeshaiah the son of Athaliah,
c82929	and with him seventy males.
c82930	And of the sons of Shephatiah; Zebadiah the son of Michael,
c82931	and with him fourscore males.
c82932	Of the sons of Joab; Obadiah the son of Jehiel,
c82933	and with him two hundred and eighteen males.
c82934	And of the sons of Shelomith; the son of Josiphiah,
c82935	and with him an hundred and threescore males.
c82936	And of the sons of Bebai; Zechariah the son of Bebai,
c82937	and with him twenty and eight males.
c82938	And of the sons of Azgad; Johanan the son of Hakkatan,
c82939	and with him an hundred and ten males.
c82940	And of the last sons of Adonikam,
c82941	whose names <i>are</i> these,
c82942	Eliphelet, Jeiel, and Shemaiah,
c82943	and with them threescore males.
c82944	Of the sons also of Bigvai; Uthai, and Zabbud,
c82945	and with them seventy males.
c82946	And I gathered them together to the river
c82947	that runneth to Ahava;
c82948	and there abode we in tents three days:
c82949	and I viewed the people, and the priests,
c82950	and found there none of the sons of Levi.
c82951	Then sent I for Eliezer, for Ariel, for Shemaiah, and for Elnathan, and for Jarib, and for Elnathan, and for Nathan, and for Zechariah, and for Meshullam, chief men; also for Joiarib, and for Elnathan, men of understanding.
c82952	And I sent them with commandment unto Iddo the chief at the place Casiphia,
c82953	and I told them what
c82954	they should say unto Iddo, <i>and</i> to his brethren the Nethinims, at the place Casiphia,
c82955	that they should bring unto us ministers for the house of our God.
c82956	And by the good hand of our God upon us they brought us a man of understanding, of the sons of Mahli, the son of Levi, the son of Israel;
c82957	and Sherebiah, with his sons and his brethren,
c82958	eighteen;
c82959	And Hashabiah,
c82960	and with him Jeshaiah of the sons of Merari, his brethren and their sons,
c82961	twenty;
c82962	Also of the Nethinims,
c82963	whom David and the princes had appointed for the service of the Levites,
c82964	two hundred and twenty Nethinims:
c82965	all of them were expressed by name.
c82966	Then I proclaimed a fast there, at the river of Ahava,
c82967	that we might afflict ourselves before our God,
c82968	to seek of him a right way for us, and for our little ones, and for all our substance.
c82969	For I was ashamed
c82970	to require of the king a band of soldiers and horsemen
c82971	to help us against the enemy in the way:
c82972	because we had spoken unto the king,
c82973	saying,
c82974	The hand of our God <i>is</i> upon all them for good that seek
c82975	him; but his power and his wrath <i>is</i> against all them that forsake him.
c82976	So we fasted
c82977	and besought our God for this:
c82978	and he was intreated of us.
c82979	Then I separated twelve of the chief of the priests, Sherebiah, Hashabiah,
c82980	and ten of their brethren with them,
c82981	And weighed unto them the silver, and the gold, and the vessels, <i>even</i> the offering of the house of our God,
c82982	which the king, and his counsellors, and his lords, and all Israel <i>there</i> present, had offered:
c82984	I even weighed unto their hand six hundred and fifty talents of silver, and silver vessels an hundred talents, <i>and</i> of gold an hundred talents;
c82985	Also twenty basons of gold, of a thousand drams; and two vessels of fine copper, precious as gold.
c82986	And I said unto
c82987	them, Ye <i>are</i> holy unto the LORD;
c82988	the vessels <i>are</i> holy
c82989	also; and the silver and the gold <i>are</i> a freewill offering unto the LORD God of your fathers.
c82990	Watch
c82991	ye, and keep
c82992	<i>them,</i> until ye weigh <i>them</i> before the chief of the priests and the Levites, and chief of the fathers of Israel, at Jerusalem, in the chambers of the house of the LORD.
c82993	So took the priests and the Levites the weight of the silver, and the gold, and the vessels,
c82994	to bring <i>them</i> to Jerusalem unto the house of our God.
c82995	Then we departed from the river of Ahava on the twelfth <i>day</i> of the first month,
c82996	to go unto Jerusalem:
c82997	and the hand of our God was upon
c82998	us, and he delivered us from the hand of the enemy, and of such as lay in wait by the way.
c82999	And we came to Jerusalem,
c83000	and abode there three days.
c83001	Now on the fourth day was the silver and the gold and the vessels weighed in the house of our God by the hand of Meremoth the son of Uriah the priest;
c83002	and with him <i>was</i> Eleazar the son of Phinehas;
c83003	and with them <i>was</i> Jozabad the son of Jeshua, and Noadiah the son of Binnui, Levites;
c83004	By number <i>and</i> by weight of every one:
c83005	and all the weight was written at that time.
c83006	which were come out of the captivity,
c83007	<i>Also</i> the children of those that had been carried away,
c83008	offered burnt offerings unto the God of Israel, twelve bullocks for all Israel, ninety and six rams, seventy and seven lambs, twelve he goats <i>for</i> a sin offering:
c83009	all <i>this was</i> a burnt offering unto the LORD.
c83010	And they delivered the king's commissions unto the king's lieutenants, and to the governors on this side the river:
c83011	and they furthered the people, and the house of God.
c83013	Now when these things were done,
c83014	the princes came to
c83015	me, saying,
c83016	The people of Israel, and the priests, and the Levites, have not separated themselves from the people of the lands, <i>doing</i> according to their abominations, <i>even</i> of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Jebusites, the Ammonites, the Moabites, the Egyptians, and the Amorites.
c83017	For they have taken of their daughters for themselves, and for their sons:
c83018	so that the holy seed have mingled themselves with the people of <i>those</i> lands:
c83019	yea, the hand of the princes and rulers hath been chief in this trespass.
c83021	And when I heard this thing,
c83022	I rent my garment and my mantle,
c83023	and plucked off the hair of my head and of my beard,
c83024	and sat down astonied.
c83025	Then were assembled unto me every one
c83026	that trembled at the words of the God of Israel, because of the transgression of those that had been carried away;
c83027	and I sat astonied until the evening sacrifice.
c83028	And at the evening sacrifice I arose up from my heaviness;
c83029	and having rent my garment and my mantle,
c83030	I fell upon my knees,
c83031	and spread out my hands unto the LORD my God,
c83032	And said,
c83033	O my God,
c83034	I am ashamed
c83035	and blush
c83036	to lift up
c83037	thee, my God:
c83038	my face to
c83039	for our iniquities are increased over <i>our</i> head,
c83040	and our trespass is grown up unto the heavens.
c83041	Since the days of our fathers <i>have</i> we <i>been</i> in a great trespass unto this day;
c83042	and for our iniquities have we, our kings, <i>and</i> our priests, been delivered into the hand of the kings of the lands, to the sword, to captivity, and to a spoil, and to confusion of face,
c83043	as <i>it is</i> this day.
c83044	And now
c83045	for a little space grace hath been <i>shewed</i> from the LORD our God,
c83046	to leave us a remnant to escape,
c83047	and to give us a nail in his holy place,
c83048	that our God may lighten our eyes,
c83049	and give us a little reviving in our bondage.
c83050	For we <i>were</i> bondmen;
c83051	yet our God hath not forsaken us in our bondage,
c83052	but hath extended mercy unto us in the sight of the kings of Persia,
c83053	to give us a reviving,
c83054	to set up the house of our God,
c83055	and to repair the desolations
c83056	thereof, and to give us a wall in Judah and in Jerusalem.
c83057	And now,
c83058	what shall we say
c83059	O our God,
c83060	after this?
c83061	for we have forsaken thy commandments,
c83062	Which thou hast commanded by thy servants the prophets,
c83063	saying,
c83064	The land,
c83065	unto which ye go
c83066	to possess
c83067	it, is an unclean land with the filthiness of the people of the lands, with their abominations,
c83068	which have filled it from one end to another with their uncleanness.
c83069	Now
c83070	therefore give not your daughters unto their sons,
c83071	neither take their daughters unto your sons,
c83072	nor seek their peace or their wealth for ever:
c83073	that ye may be strong,
c83074	and eat the good of the land,
c83075	and leave <i>it</i> for an inheritance to your children for ever.
c83076	And after all
c83077	that is come upon us for our evil deeds, and for our great trespass,
c83078	seeing that thou
c83079	our God
c83080	hast punished us less than our iniquities
c83081	<i>deserve,</i> and hast given us <i>such</i> deliverance as this;
c83082	Should we again
c83083	break thy commandments,
c83084	and join in affinity with the people of these abominations?
c83085	wouldest not thou be angry
c83086	with us till thou hadst consumed <i>us,</i> so that <i>there should be</i> no remnant nor escaping?
c83087	O LORD God of Israel,
c83088	thou <i>art</i> righteous:
c83089	for we remain yet escaped,
c83090	of this.
c83091	behold, we <i>are</i> before thee in our trespasses:
c83092	for we cannot stand before thee because
c83093	as <i>it is</i> this day:
c83095	Now when Ezra had prayed,
c83096	and when he had confessed,
c83097	weeping
c83098	and casting himself down before the house of God,
c83099	there assembled unto him out of Israel a very great congregation of men and women and children:
c83100	for the people wept very sore.
c83101	And Shechaniah the son of Jehiel, <i>one</i> of the sons of Elam, answered
c83102	and said unto Ezra,
c83103	We have trespassed against our God,
c83104	and have taken strange wives of the people of the land:
c83105	yet now
c83106	there is hope in Israel concerning this thing.
c83107	Now
c83108	therefore let us make a covenant with our God
c83109	to put away all the wives,
c83110	and such as are born of
c83111	them, according to the counsel of my lord,
c83112	and of those that tremble at the commandment of our God;
c83113	and let it be done according to the law.
c83114	Arise;
c83115	for <i>this</i> matter <i>belongeth</i> unto
c83116	thee: we also <i>will be</i> with
c83117	thee: be of good courage,
c83118	and do <i>it.</i>
c83119	Then arose Ezra,
c83120	and made the chief priests, the Levites, and all Israel, to swear
c83121	that they should do according to this word.
c83122	And they sware.
c83123	Then Ezra rose up from before the house of God,
c83124	and went into the chamber of Johanan the son of Eliashib:
c83125	and <i>when</i> he came thither,
c83126	he did eat no bread,
c83127	nor drink water:
c83128	for he mourned because of the transgression of them that had been carried away.
c83129	And they made proclamation throughout Judah and Jerusalem unto all the children of the captivity,
c83130	that they should gather themselves together unto Jerusalem;
c83131	And that whosoever
c83132	would not come within three days, according to the counsel of the princes and the elders,
c83133	all his substance should be forfeited,
c83134	and himself separated from the congregation of those that had been carried away.
c83135	Then all the men of Judah and Benjamin gathered themselves together unto Jerusalem within three days.
c83136	It <i>was</i> the ninth month,
c83137	on the twentieth <i>day</i> of the month;
c83138	and all the people sat in the street of the house of God,
c83139	trembling because of <i>this</i> matter, and for the great rain.
c83140	And Ezra the priest stood up,
c83141	and said unto
c83142	them, Ye have transgressed,
c83143	and have taken strange wives,
c83144	to increase the trespass of Israel.
c83145	Now
c83146	therefore make confession unto the LORD God of your fathers,
c83147	and do his pleasure:
c83148	and separate yourselves from the people of the land, and from the strange wives.
c83149	Then all the congregation answered
c83150	and said with a loud voice,
c83151	As thou hast said, so
c83152	must we do.
c83153	But the people <i>are</i> many,
c83154	and <i>it is</i> a time of much rain,
c83155	and we are not able
c83156	to stand without,
c83157	neither <i>is this</i> a work of one day
c83158	or two:
c83159	for we are many
c83160	that have transgressed in this thing.
c83161	Let now our rulers of all the congregation stand,
c83162	and let all
c83163	them which have taken strange wives in our cities
c83165	come at appointed times,
c83166	and with them the elders of every city, and the judges
c83167	thereof, until the fierce wrath of our God for this matter be turned from us.
c83168	Only Jonathan the son of Asahel and Jahaziah the son of Tikvah were employed about this
c83169	<i>matter:</i> and Meshullam and Shabbethai the Levite helped them.
c83170	And the children of the captivity did so.
c83171	And Ezra the priest, <i>with</i> certain chief of the fathers, after the house of their fathers, and all of them by <i>their</i> names, were separated,
c83173	and sat down in the first day of the tenth month
c83174	to examine the matter.
c83175	And they made an end with all the men
c83176	that had taken strange wives
c83177	by the first day of the first month.
c83178	And among the sons of the priests there were found
c83179	that had taken strange wives:
c83180	<i>namely,</i> of the sons of Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and his brethren; Maaseiah, and Eliezer, and Jarib, and Gedaliah.
c83181	And they gave their hands
c83182	that they would put away their wives;
c83183	and <i>being</i> guilty, <i>they offered</i> a ram of the flock for their trespass.
c83184	And of the sons of Immer; Hanani, and Zebadiah.
c83185	And of the sons of Harim; Maaseiah, and Elijah, and Shemaiah, and Jehiel, and Uzziah.
c83186	And of the sons of Pashur; Elioenai, Maaseiah, Ishmael, Nethaneel, Jozabad, and Elasah.
c83187	Also of the Levites; Jozabad, and Shimei, and Kelaiah,
c83188	(the same <i>is</i> Kelita,)
c83189	Pethahiah, Judah, and Eliezer.
c83190	Of the singers also; Eliashib:
c83191	and of the porters; Shallum, and Telem, and Uri.
c83192	Moreover of Israel: of the sons of Parosh; Ramiah, and Jeziah, and Malchiah, and Miamin, and Eleazar, and Malchijah, and Benaiah.
c83193	And of the sons of Elam; Mattaniah, Zechariah, and Jehiel, and Abdi, and Jeremoth, and Eliah.
c83194	And of the sons of Zattu; Elioenai, Eliashib, Mattaniah, and Jeremoth, and Zabad, and Aziza.
c83195	Of the sons also of Bebai; Jehohanan, Hananiah, Zabbai, <i>and</i> Athlai.
c83196	And of the sons of Bani; Meshullam, Malluch, and Adaiah, Jashub, and Sheal, and Ramoth.
c83197	And of the sons of Pahathmoab; Adna, and Chelal, Benaiah, Maaseiah, Mattaniah, Bezaleel, and Binnui, and Manasseh.
c83198	And <i>of</i> the sons of Harim; Eliezer, Ishijah, Malchiah, Shemaiah, Shimeon,
c83199	Benjamin, Malluch, <i>and</i> Shemariah.
c83200	Of the sons of Hashum; Mattenai, Mattathah, Zabad, Eliphelet, Jeremai, Manasseh, <i>and</i> Shimei.
c83201	Of the sons of Bani; Maadai, Amram, and Uel,
c83202	Benaiah, Bedeiah, Chelluh,
c83203	Vaniah, Meremoth, Eliashib,
c83204	Mattaniah, Mattenai, and Jaasau,
c83205	And Bani, and Binnui, Shimei,
c83206	And Shelemiah, and Nathan, and Adaiah,
c83207	Machnadebai, Shashai, Sharai,
c83208	Azareel, and Shelemiah, Shemariah,
c83209	Shallum, Amariah, <i>and</i> Joseph.
c83210	Of the sons of Nebo; Jeiel, Mattithiah, Zabad, Zebina, Jadau, and Joel, Benaiah.
c83211	All these had taken strange wives:
c83212	and <i>some</i> of them had wives
c83213	by whom they had children.
c83214	The words of Nehemiah the son of Hachaliah.
c83215	And it came to pass in the month Chisleu, in the twentieth year,
c83216	as I was in Shushan the palace,
c83217	That Hanani, one of my brethren, came,
c83218	he and <i>certain</i> men of Judah;
c83219	and I asked them concerning the Jews that had escaped,
c83220	which were left of the captivity,
c83221	and concerning Jerusalem.
c83222	And they said
c83223	unto me, The remnant
c83224	that are left of the captivity there in the province
c83225	<i>are</i> in great affliction and reproach:
c83226	the wall of Jerusalem also <i>is</i> broken down,
c83227	and the gates thereof are burned with fire.
c83228	And it came to pass,
c83229	when I heard these words,
c83230	that I sat down
c83231	and wept,
c83232	and mourned <i>certain</i> days,
c83233	and fasted,
c83234	and prayed before the God of heaven,
c83235	And said,
c83236	I beseech thee, O LORD God of heaven, the great and terrible God,
c83237	that keepeth covenant and mercy for them that love him and observe his commandments:
c83238	Let thine ear now be attentive,
c83239	and thine eyes open,
c83240	that thou mayest hear the prayer of thy servant,
c83241	which I pray before thee now, day and night, for the children of Israel thy servants,
c83242	and confess the sins of the children of Israel,
c83243	which we have sinned
c83244	against thee: both I and my father's house have sinned.
c83245	We have dealt very corruptly
c83246	against thee, and have not kept the commandments, nor the statutes, nor the judgments,
c83247	which thou commandedst thy servant Moses.
c83248	Remember, I beseech thee, the word
c83249	that thou commandedst thy servant Moses,
c83250	saying,
c83251	<i>If</i> ye transgress,
c83252	I will scatter you abroad among the nations:
c83253	But <i>if</i> ye turn unto
c83254	me, and keep my commandments,
c83255	and do
c83256	them; though there were of you cast out unto the uttermost part of the heaven,
c83257	<i>yet</i> will I gather them from thence,
c83258	and will bring them unto the place
c83259	that I have chosen
c83260	to set my name there.
c83261	Now these <i>are</i> thy servants and thy people,
c83262	whom thou hast redeemed by thy great power, and by thy strong hand.
c83263	O Lord, I beseech
c83264	thee, let now thine ear be attentive to the prayer of thy servant, and to the prayer of thy servants,
c83265	who desire
c83266	to fear thy name:
c83267	and prosper, I pray thee, thy servant this day,
c83268	and grant him mercy in the sight of this man.
c83269	For I was the king's cupbearer.
c83270	And it came to pass in the month Nisan, in the twentieth year of Artaxerxes the king,
c83271	<i>that</i> wine <i>was</i> before
c83272	him: and I took up the wine,
c83273	and gave <i>it</i> unto the king.
c83274	Now I had not been <i>beforetime</i> sad in his presence.
c83275	Wherefore the king said
c83276	unto me, Why <i>is</i> thy countenance sad,
c83277	seeing thou
c83278	<i>art</i> not sick?
c83279	this <i>is</i> nothing
c83280	<i>else</i> but sorrow of heart.
c83281	Then I was very sore afraid,
c83282	And said unto the king,
c83283	Let the king live for ever:
c83284	why should not my countenance be sad,
c83285	when the city, the place of my fathers' sepulchres, <i>lieth</i> waste,
c83286	and the gates thereof are consumed with fire?
c83287	Then the king said
c83288	unto me, For what dost thou make request?
c83289	So I prayed to the God of heaven.
c83290	And I said unto the king,
c83291	If it please the king,
c83292	and if thy servant have found favour in thy sight,
c83293	that thou wouldest send me unto Judah, unto the city of my fathers' sepulchres,
c83294	that I may build it.
c83295	And the king said
c83296	unto me, (the queen also sitting by
c83297	him,) For how long shall thy journey be?
c83298	and when wilt thou return?
c83299	So it pleased the king
c83300	to send
c83301	me; and I set him a time.
c83302	Moreover I said unto the king,
c83303	If it please the king,
c83304	let letters be given me to the governors beyond the river,
c83305	that they may convey me over
c83306	till I come into Judah;
c83307	And a letter unto Asaph the keeper of the king's forest,
c83308	that
c83309	he may give me timber to make beams for the gates of the palace which
c83311	<i>appertained</i> to the house, and for the wall of the city,
c83313	and for the house that
c83314	I shall enter into.
c83315	And the king granted me, according to the good hand of my God
c83316	upon me.
c83317	Then I came to the governors beyond the river,
c83318	and gave them the king's letters.
c83319	Now the king had sent captains of the army and horsemen with me.
c83320	When Sanballat the Horonite, and Tobiah the servant, the Ammonite, heard
c83321	<i>of it,</i> it grieved them exceedingly
c83322	that there was come a man
c83323	to seek the welfare of the children of Israel.
c83324	So I came to Jerusalem,
c83325	and was there three days.
c83326	And I arose in the night, I and some few men with
c83327	me; neither told I <i>any</i> man
c83328	what my God had put in my heart
c83329	to do at Jerusalem:
c83330	neither <i>was there any</i> beast with
c83331	me, save the beast
c83332	that I rode upon.
c83333	And I went out by night by the gate of the valley,
c83334	even before the dragon well,
c83335	and to the dung port,
c83336	and viewed the walls of Jerusalem,
c83337	which were broken down,
c83338	and the gates thereof were consumed with fire.
c83339	Then I went on to the gate of the fountain, and to the king's pool:
c83340	but <i>there was</i> no place for the beast
c83341	<i>that was</i> under me to pass.
c83342	Then went I up in the night by the brook,
c83343	and viewed the wall,
c83344	and turned back,
c83345	and entered by the gate of the valley,
c83346	and <i>so</i> returned.
c83347	And the rulers knew not
c83348	whither I went,
c83349	or what I did;
c83350	neither had I as yet told <i>it</i> to the Jews, nor to the priests, nor to the nobles, nor to the rulers, nor to the rest that did the work.
c83351	Then said I unto
c83352	them, Ye see the distress
c83353	that we
c83354	<i>are</i> in, how Jerusalem <i>lieth</i> waste,
c83355	and the gates thereof are burned with fire:
c83356	come,
c83357	and let us build up the wall of Jerusalem,
c83358	that we be no more a reproach.
c83359	Then I told them of the hand of my God
c83360	which was good upon
c83361	me; as also the king's words
c83362	that he had spoken
c83363	unto me. And they said,
c83364	Let us rise up
c83365	and build.
c83366	So they strengthened their hands for <i>this</i> good <i>work.</i>
c83367	But when Sanballat the Horonite, and Tobiah the servant, the Ammonite, and Geshem the Arabian, heard
c83368	<i>it,</i> they laughed us to scorn,
c83369	and despised
c83370	us, and said,
c83371	What <i>is</i> this thing
c83372	that ye do?
c83373	will ye rebel against the king?
c83374	Then answered
c83375	I them, and said
c83376	unto them, The God of heaven,
c83377	he will prosper
c83378	us; therefore we his servants will arise
c83379	and build:
c83380	but ye have no portion, nor right, nor memorial, in Jerusalem.
c83381	Then Eliashib the high priest rose up with his brethren the priests,
c83382	and they builded the sheep gate;
c83383	they sanctified
c83384	it, and set up the doors
c83385	of it; even unto the tower of Meah they sanctified it, unto the tower of Hananeel.
c83386	And next unto him builded the men of Jericho.
c83387	And next to them builded Zaccur the son of Imri.
c83388	But the fish gate did the sons of Hassenaah build,
c83389	who <i>also</i> laid the beams
c83390	thereof, and set up the doors thereof, the locks thereof, and the bars thereof.
c83391	And next unto them repaired Meremoth the son of Urijah, the son of Koz.
c83392	And next unto them repaired Meshullam the son of Berechiah, the son of Meshezabeel.
c83393	And next unto them repaired Zadok the son of Baana.
c83394	And next unto them the Tekoites repaired;
c83395	but their nobles put not their necks to the work of their Lord.
c83396	Moreover the old gate repaired Jehoiada the son of Paseah, and Meshullam the son of Besodeiah;
c83397	they laid the beams
c83398	thereof, and set up the doors thereof, and the locks thereof, and the bars thereof.
c83399	And next unto them repaired Melatiah the Gibeonite, and Jadon the Meronothite, the men of Gibeon, and of Mizpah, unto the throne of the governor on this side the river.
c83400	Next unto him repaired Uzziel the son of Harhaiah, of the goldsmiths.
c83401	Next unto him also repaired Hananiah the son of <i>one of</i> the apothecaries,
c83402	and they fortified Jerusalem unto the broad wall.
c83403	And next unto them repaired Rephaiah the son of Hur, the ruler of the half part of Jerusalem.
c83404	And next unto them repaired Jedaiah the son of Harumaph,
c83405	even over against his house.
c83406	And next unto him repaired Hattush the son of Hashabniah.
c83407	Malchijah the son of Harim, and Hashub the son of Pahathmoab, repaired the other piece,
c83408	and the tower of the furnaces.
c83409	And next unto him repaired Shallum the son of Halohesh, the ruler of the half part of Jerusalem, he and his daughters.
c83410	The valley gate repaired Hanun, and the inhabitants of Zanoah;
c83411	they built
c83412	it, and set up the doors thereof, the locks thereof, and the bars
c83413	thereof, and a thousand cubits on the wall unto the dung gate.
c83414	But the dung gate repaired Malchiah the son of Rechab, the ruler of part of Bethhaccerem;
c83415	he built
c83416	it, and set up the doors thereof, the locks thereof, and the bars thereof.
c83417	But the gate of the fountain repaired Shallun the son of Colhozeh, the ruler of part of Mizpah;
c83418	he built
c83419	it, and covered
c83420	it, and set up the doors thereof, the locks thereof, and the bars
c83421	thereof, and the wall of the pool of Siloah by the king's garden, and unto the stairs
c83422	that go down from the city of David.
c83423	After him repaired Nehemiah the son of Azbuk, the ruler of the half part of Bethzur, unto <i>the place</i> over against the sepulchres of David, and to the pool
c83424	that was made,
c83425	and unto the house of the mighty.
c83426	After him repaired the Levites, Rehum the son of Bani.
c83427	Next unto him repaired Hashabiah, the ruler of the half part of Keilah, in his part.
c83428	After him repaired their brethren, Bavai the son of Henadad, the ruler of the half part of Keilah.
c83429	And next to him repaired Ezer the son of Jeshua, the ruler of Mizpah, another piece
c83430	over against the going up to the armoury at the turning <i>of the wall.</i>
c83431	After him Baruch the son of Zabbai earnestly
c83432	repaired the other piece, from the turning <i>of the wall</i> unto the door of the house of Eliashib the high priest.
c83433	After him repaired Meremoth the son of Urijah the son of Koz another piece, from the door of the house of Eliashib even to the end of the house of Eliashib.
c83434	And after him repaired the priests, the men of the plain.
c83435	After him repaired Benjamin and Hashub over against their house.
c83436	After him repaired Azariah the son of Maaseiah the son of Ananiah by his house.
c83437	After him repaired Binnui the son of Henadad another piece, from the house of Azariah unto the turning <i>of the wall,</i> even unto the corner.
c83438	Palal the son of Uzai, over against the turning <i>of the wall,</i> and the tower
c83439	which lieth out from the king's high house,
c83441	that <i>was</i> by the court of the prison.
c83442	After him Pedaiah the son of Parosh.
c83443	Moreover the Nethinims dwelt in Ophel,
c83444	unto <i>the place</i> over against the water gate toward the east, and the tower
c83445	that lieth out.
c83446	After them the Tekoites repaired another piece, over against the great tower
c83447	that lieth out,
c83448	even unto the wall of Ophel.
c83449	From above the horse gate repaired the priests,
c83450	every one over against his house.
c83451	After them repaired Zadok the son of Immer over against his house.
c83452	After him repaired also Shemaiah the son of Shechaniah, the keeper of the east gate.
c83453	After him repaired Hananiah the son of Shelemiah, and Hanun the sixth son of Zalaph, another piece.
c83454	After him repaired Meshullam the son of Berechiah over against his chamber.
c83455	After him repaired Malchiah the goldsmith's son unto the place of the Nethinims, and of the merchants, over against the gate Miphkad, and to the going up of the corner.
c83456	And between the going up of the corner unto the sheep gate repaired the goldsmiths and the merchants.
c83457	But it came to pass,
c83458	that when Sanballat heard
c83459	that we builded the wall,
c83460	he was wroth,
c83461	and took great indignation,
c83462	and mocked the Jews.
c83463	And he spake before his brethren and the army of Samaria,
c83464	and said,
c83465	What do these feeble Jews?
c83466	will they fortify themselves? will they sacrifice?
c83468	will they make an end in a day?
c83469	will they revive the stones out of the heaps of the rubbish which
c83470	are burned?
c83471	Now Tobiah the Ammonite <i>was</i> by
c83472	him, and he said,
c83473	Even that which they build,
c83474	if a fox go up,
c83475	he shall even break down their stone wall.
c83476	Hear,
c83477	O our God;
c83478	for we are despised:
c83479	and turn their reproach upon their own head,
c83480	and give them for a prey in the land of captivity:
c83481	And cover not their iniquity,
c83482	and let not their sin be blotted out from before
c83483	thee: for they have provoked <i>thee</i> to anger before the builders.
c83484	So built we the wall;
c83485	and all the wall was joined together unto the half
c83486	thereof: for the people had a mind
c83487	to work.
c83488	But it came to pass,
c83489	<i>that</i> when Sanballat, and Tobiah, and the Arabians, and the Ammonites, and the Ashdodites, heard
c83490	that the walls of Jerusalem were made up,
c83491	<i>and</i> that the breaches began
c83492	to be stopped,
c83493	then they were very wroth,
c83494	And conspired all of them together
c83495	to come
c83496	<i>and</i> to fight against Jerusalem,
c83497	and to hinder it.
c83498	Nevertheless we made our prayer unto our God,
c83499	and set a watch against them day and night, because of them.
c83500	And Judah said,
c83501	The strength of the bearers of burdens is decayed,
c83502	and <i>there is</i> much rubbish;
c83503	so that we are not able
c83504	to build the wall.
c83505	And our adversaries said,
c83506	They shall not know,
c83507	neither see,
c83508	till we come in the midst among
c83509	them, and slay
c83510	them, and cause the work to cease.
c83511	And it came to pass,
c83512	that when the Jews which dwelt by them came,
c83514	they said unto us ten times,
c83515	From all places
c83516	whence ye shall return unto us <i>they will be upon you.</i>
c83517	Therefore set I in the lower places behind the wall, <i>and</i> on the higher places,
c83518	I even set the people after their families with their swords, their spears, and their bows.
c83519	And I looked,
c83520	and rose up,
c83521	and said unto the nobles, and to the rulers, and to the rest of the people,
c83522	Be not ye afraid of
c83523	them: remember the Lord, <i>which is</i> great and terrible,
c83524	and fight for your brethren, your sons, and your daughters, your wives, and your houses.
c83525	And it came to pass,
c83526	when our enemies heard
c83527	that it was known
c83528	unto us, and God had brought their counsel to nought,
c83529	that we returned all of us to the wall,
c83530	every one unto his work.
c83531	And it came to pass from that time
c83532	forth, <i>that</i> the half of my servants wrought in the work,
c83533	and the other half of them held
c83534	both the spears, the shields, and the bows, and the habergeons;
c83535	and the rulers <i>were</i> behind all the house of Judah.
c83536	They which builded on the wall,
c83537	and they that bare burdens, with those that laded,
c83538	<i>every one</i> with one of his hands wrought in the work,
c83539	and with the other <i>hand</i> held a weapon.
c83540	For the builders, every one had his sword girded by his side,
c83541	and <i>so</i> builded.
c83542	And he that sounded the trumpet <i>was</i> by me.
c83543	And I said unto the nobles, and to the rulers, and to the rest of the people,
c83544	The work <i>is</i> great
c83545	and large,
c83546	and we are separated upon the wall,
c83547	one far from another.
c83549	In what place <i>therefore</i> ye hear the sound of the trumpet,
c83550	resort ye thither unto
c83551	us: our God shall fight for us.
c83552	So we laboured in the work:
c83553	and half of them held the spears
c83554	from the rising of the morning
c83555	till the stars appeared.
c83556	Likewise at the same time said I unto the people,
c83557	Let every one with his servant lodge within Jerusalem,
c83558	that in the night they may be a guard
c83559	to us, and labour on the day.
c83560	So neither I, nor my brethren, nor my servants, nor the men of the guard which followed
c83562	me, none of us put off our clothes, <i>saving that</i> every one
c83563	put them off for washing.
c83564	And there was a great cry of the people and of their wives against their brethren the Jews.
c83565	For there were
c83566	that said,
c83567	We, our sons, and our daughters, <i>are</i> many:
c83568	therefore we take up corn
c83569	<i>for them,</i> that we may eat,
c83570	and live.
c83571	<i>Some</i> also there were
c83572	that said,
c83573	We have mortgaged our lands, vineyards, and houses,
c83574	that we might buy corn, because of the dearth.
c83575	There were
c83576	also that said,
c83577	We have borrowed money for the king's tribute, <i>and that upon</i> our lands and vineyards.
c83578	Yet now
c83579	our flesh <i>is</i> as the flesh of our brethren,
c83580	our children as their children:
c83581	and, lo,
c83582	we bring into bondage our sons and our daughters to be servants,
c83583	and <i>some</i> of our daughters are brought unto bondage
c83584	<i>already:</i> neither <i>is it</i> in our power
c83585	<i>to redeem them;</i> for other men have our lands and vineyards.
c83586	And I was very angry
c83587	when I heard their cry and these words.
c83588	Then I consulted with myself,
c83589	and I rebuked the nobles, and the rulers,
c83590	and said
c83592	every one of his brother.
c83593	unto them, Ye exact usury,
c83594	And I set a great assembly against them.
c83595	And I said
c83596	unto them, We after our ability have redeemed our brethren the Jews,
c83597	which were sold unto the heathen;
c83599	and will ye even sell your brethren?
c83600	or shall they be sold
c83601	unto us? Then held they their peace,
c83602	and found nothing <i>to answer.</i>
c83603	Also I said,
c83604	It <i>is</i> not good
c83605	that ye do:
c83606	ought ye not to walk in the fear of our God because of the reproach of the heathen our enemies?
c83607	I likewise, <i>and</i> my brethren, and my servants, might exact of them money and corn:
c83608	I pray you, let us leave off this usury.
c83609	Restore, I pray you, to them, even this day, their lands, their vineyards, their oliveyards, and their houses, also the hundredth <i>part</i> of the money, and of the corn, the wine, and the oil,
c83610	that ye exact of them.
c83611	Then said
c83612	they, We will restore
c83613	<i>them,</i> and will require nothing of
c83614	them; so will we do
c83615	as thou sayest.
c83616	Then I called the priests,
c83617	and took an oath
c83618	of them, that they should do according to this promise.
c83619	Also I shook my lap,
c83620	and said,
c83621	So God shake out every man
c83622	that performeth not this promise,
c83623	from his house, and from his labour,
c83624	even thus be he shaken out, and emptied.
c83625	And all the congregation said,
c83626	Amen,
c83627	and praised the LORD.
c83628	And the people did according to this promise.
c83629	Moreover from the time
c83630	that I was appointed
c83631	to be their governor in the land of Judah,
c83632	from the twentieth year even unto the two and thirtieth year of Artaxerxes the king, <i>that is,</i> twelve years, I and my brethren have not eaten the bread of the governor.
c83633	But the former governors
c83634	that <i>had been</i> before
c83635	me were chargeable unto the people,
c83636	and had taken of them bread and wine,
c83637	beside forty shekels of silver;
c83638	yea, even their servants bare rule over the people:
c83639	but so did not I, because of the fear of God.
c83640	Yea, also I continued in the work of this wall,
c83641	neither bought we any land:
c83642	and all my servants <i>were</i> gathered thither unto the work.
c83643	an hundred and fifty of the Jews and rulers,
c83644	beside those that came unto us from among the heathen
c83645	that <i>are</i> about us.
c83646	Moreover <i>there were</i> at my table
c83648	Now <i>that</i> which was prepared <i>for me</i> daily
c83649	<i>was</i> one ox <i>and</i> six choice sheep;
c83650	also fowls were prepared
c83651	for me, and once in ten days store of all sorts of wine:
c83652	yet for all this required not I the bread of the governor,
c83653	because the bondage was heavy upon this people.
c83654	Think
c83655	upon me, my God,
c83656	for good, <i>according</i> to all
c83657	that I have done for this people.
c83658	Now it came to pass,
c83659	when Sanballat, and Tobiah, and Geshem the Arabian, and the rest of our enemies, heard
c83660	that I had builded the wall,
c83661	and <i>that</i> there was no breach left
c83662	therein; (though at that time I had not set up the doors upon the gates;)
c83663	That Sanballat and Geshem sent unto
c83664	me, saying,
c83665	Come,
c83666	let us meet together in <i>some one of</i> the villages in the plain of Ono.
c83667	But they thought
c83668	to do me mischief.
c83669	And I sent messengers unto
c83670	them, saying,
c83671	I <i>am</i> doing a great work,
c83672	so that I cannot
c83673	come down:
c83674	why should the work cease,
c83675	whilst I leave
c83676	it, and come down to you?
c83677	Yet they sent unto me four times after this sort;
c83678	and I answered them after the same manner.
c83679	Then sent Sanballat his servant unto me in like manner the fifth time
c83680	with an open letter in his hand;
c83681	Wherein <i>was</i> written,
c83682	It is reported among the heathen,
c83683	and Gashmu saith
c83684	<i>it, that</i> thou and the Jews think
c83685	to rebel:
c83686	for which cause thou buildest the wall,
c83687	that thou mayest be their king, according to these words.
c83688	And thou hast also appointed prophets
c83689	to preach of thee at Jerusalem,
c83690	saying,
c83691	<i>There is</i> a king in Judah:
c83692	and now
c83693	shall it be reported to the king according to these words.
c83694	now
c83695	Come
c83696	therefore, and let us take counsel together.
c83697	Then I sent unto
c83698	him, saying,
c83699	There are no such things
c83700	done as thou sayest,
c83701	but thou feignest them out of thine own heart.
c83702	For they all made us afraid,
c83703	saying,
c83704	Their hands shall be weakened from the work,
c83705	that it be not done.
c83706	Now
c83707	therefore, <i>O God,</i> strengthen my hands.
c83708	Afterward I came unto the house of Shemaiah the son of Delaiah the son of Mehetabeel,
c83709	who <i>was</i> shut up;
c83710	and he said,
c83711	Let us meet together in the house of God, within the temple,
c83712	and let us shut the doors of the temple:
c83713	for they will come
c83714	to slay
c83715	thee; yea, in the night will they come
c83716	to slay thee.
c83717	And I said,
c83718	Should such a man as I flee?
c83719	and who <i>is there,</i> that, <i>being</i> as I
c83720	<i>am,</i> would go into the temple
c83721	to save his life?
c83722	I will not go in.
c83723	I perceived
c83724	And, lo,
c83725	that God had not sent
c83726	him; but that he pronounced this prophecy against
c83727	me: for Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him.
c83728	Therefore <i>was</i> he hired,
c83729	that I should be afraid,
c83730	and do so,
c83731	and sin,
c83732	and <i>that</i> they might have <i>matter</i> for an evil report,
c83733	that they might reproach me.
c83734	think
c83735	My God,
c83736	thou upon Tobiah and Sanballat according to these their works,
c83737	and on the prophetess Noadiah, and the rest of the prophets,
c83738	that would have put me in fear.
c83739	So the wall was finished in the twenty and fifth <i>day</i> of <i>the month</i> Elul, in fifty and two days.
c83740	And it came to pass,
c83741	that when all our enemies heard
c83742	<i>thereof,</i> and all the heathen that <i>were</i> about us saw
c83744	<i>these things,</i> they were much cast down in their own eyes:
c83745	for they perceived
c83746	that this work was wrought of our God.
c83747	Moreover in those days the nobles of Judah sent many letters
c83748	unto Tobiah,
c83750	and <i>the letters</i> of Tobiah
c83751	came unto them.
c83752	For <i>there were</i> many in Judah sworn
c83753	unto him, because he <i>was</i> the son in law of Shechaniah the son of Arah;
c83754	and his son Johanan had taken the daughter of Meshullam the son of Berechiah.
c83755	Also they reported his good deeds before
c83756	me, and uttered my words
c83757	to him. <i>And</i> Tobiah sent letters
c83758	to put me in fear.
c83759	Now it came to pass,
c83760	when the wall was built,
c83761	and I had set up the doors,
c83762	and the porters and the singers and the Levites were appointed,
c83763	That I gave my brother Hanani, and Hananiah the ruler of the palace, charge over Jerusalem:
c83764	for he <i>was</i> a faithful man,
c83765	and feared God above many.
c83766	And I said
c83767	unto them, Let not the gates of Jerusalem be opened
c83768	until the sun be hot;
c83769	and while they stand
c83770	by, let them shut the doors,
c83771	and bar
c83772	<i>them:</i> and appoint watches of the inhabitants of Jerusalem,
c83773	every one in his watch,
c83774	and every one <i>to be</i> over against his house.
c83775	Now the city <i>was</i> large and great:
c83776	but the people <i>were</i> few therein,
c83777	and the houses <i>were</i> not builded.
c83778	And my God put into mine heart
c83779	to gather together the nobles, and the rulers, and the people,
c83780	that they might be reckoned by genealogy.
c83781	And I found a register of the genealogy
c83782	of them which came up at the first,
c83783	and found
c83784	written therein,
c83785	These <i>are</i> the children of the province,
c83786	that went up out of the captivity, of those that had been carried away,
c83787	whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away,
c83788	and came again to Jerusalem and to Judah,
c83789	every one unto his city;
c83790	Who came with Zerubbabel, Jeshua, Nehemiah, Azariah, Raamiah, Nahamani, Mordecai, Bilshan, Mispereth, Bigvai, Nehum, Baanah.
c83791	The number, <i>I say,</i> of the men of the people of Israel <i>was this;</i>
c83792	The children of Parosh, two thousand an hundred seventy and two.
c83793	The children of Shephatiah, three hundred seventy and two.
c83794	The children of Arah, six hundred fifty and two.
c83795	The children of Pahathmoab, of the children of Jeshua and Joab, two thousand and eight hundred <i>and</i> eighteen.
c83796	The children of Elam, a thousand two hundred fifty and four.
c83797	The children of Zattu, eight hundred forty and five.

c83810	The men of Bethlehem and Netophah, an hundred fourscore and eight.
c83811	The men of Anathoth, an hundred twenty and eight.
c83812	The men of Bethazmaveth, forty and two.
c83813	The men of Kirjathjearim, Chephirah, and Beeroth, seven hundred forty and three.
c83814	The men of Ramah and Geba, six hundred twenty and one.
c83815	The men of Michmas, an hundred and twenty and two.
c83816	The men of Bethel and Ai, an hundred twenty and three.
c83817	The men of the other Nebo, fifty and two.
c83818	The children of the other Elam, a thousand two hundred fifty and four.
c83819	The children of Harim, three hundred and twenty.
c83820	The children of Jericho, three hundred forty and five.
c83821	The children of Lod, Hadid, and Ono, seven hundred twenty and one.
c83822	The children of Senaah, three thousand nine hundred and thirty.
c83823	The priests:
c83824	the children of Jedaiah, of the house of Jeshua, nine hundred seventy and three.
c83825	The children of Immer, a thousand fifty and two.
c83826	The children of Pashur, a thousand two hundred forty and seven.
c83827	The children of Harim, a thousand and seventeen.
c83828	The Levites:
c83829	the children of Jeshua, of Kadmiel, <i>and</i> of the children of Hodevah, seventy and four.
c83830	The singers:
c83831	the children of Asaph, an hundred forty and eight.
c83832	The porters:
c83833	the children of Shallum, the children of Ater, the children of Talmon, the children of Akkub, the children of Hatita, the children of Shobai, an hundred thirty and eight.
c83834	The Nethinims: the children of Ziha, the children of Hashupha, the children of Tabbaoth,
c83835	The children of Keros, the children of Sia, the children of Padon,
c83836	The children of Lebana, the children of Hagaba, the children of Shalmai,
c83837	The children of Hanan, the children of Giddel, the children of Gahar,
c83838	The children of Reaiah, the children of Rezin, the children of Nekoda,
c83839	The children of Gazzam, the children of Uzza, the children of Phaseah,
c83840	The children of Besai, the children of Meunim, the children of Nephishesim,
c83841	The children of Bakbuk, the children of Hakupha, the children of Harhur,
c83842	The children of Bazlith, the children of Mehida, the children of Harsha,
c83843	The children of Barkos, the children of Sisera, the children of Tamah,
c83844	The children of Neziah, the children of Hatipha.
c83845	The children of Solomon's servants: the children of Sotai, the children of Sophereth, the children of Perida,
c83846	The children of Jaala, the children of Darkon, the children of Giddel,
c83847	The children of Shephatiah, the children of Hattil, the children of Pochereth of Zebaim, the children of Amon.
c83848	All the Nethinims, and the children of Solomon's servants, <i>were</i> three hundred ninety and two.
c83849	And these
c83850	<i>were</i> they which went up <i>also</i> from Telmelah, Telharesha, Cherub, Addon, and Immer:
c83851	but they could not
c83852	shew their father's house, nor their seed,
c83853	whether they <i>were</i> of Israel.
c83854	The children of Delaiah, the children of Tobiah, the children of Nekoda, six hundred forty and two.
c83855	And of the priests: the children of Habaiah, the children of Koz, the children of Barzillai,
c83856	which took <i>one</i> of the daughters of Barzillai the Gileadite to wife,
c83857	and was called after their name.
c83858	These sought their register
c83859	<i>among</i> those that were reckoned by genealogy,
c83860	but it was not found:
c83861	therefore were they, as polluted, put from the priesthood.
c83862	And the Tirshatha said
c83863	unto them, that they should not eat of the most holy things,
c83864	till there stood <i>up</i> a priest with Urim and Thummim.
c83865	The whole congregation together <i>was</i> forty and two thousand three hundred and threescore,
c83866	Beside their manservants and their maidservants,
c83867	of whom <i>there were</i> seven thousand three hundred thirty and seven:
c83868	and they had two hundred forty and five singing men and singing women.
c83869	<i>Their</i> camels, four hundred thirty and five:
c83870	six thousand seven hundred and twenty asses.
c83871	And some of the chief of the fathers gave unto the work.
c83872	The Tirshatha gave to the treasure a thousand drams of gold, fifty basons, five hundred and thirty priests' garments.
c83873	And <i>some</i> of the chief of the fathers gave to the treasure of the work twenty thousand drams of gold, and two thousand and two hundred pound of silver.
c83875	And <i>that</i> which the rest of the people gave
c83876	<i>was</i> twenty thousand drams of gold, and two thousand pound of silver, and threescore and seven priests' garments.
c83877	So the priests, and the Levites, and the porters, and the singers, and <i>some</i> of the people, and the Nethinims, and all Israel, dwelt in their cities;
c83878	and when the seventh month came,
c83879	the children of Israel <i>were</i> in their cities.
c83880	And all the people gathered themselves together as one man into the street
c83881	that <i>was</i> before the water gate;
c83882	and they spake unto Ezra the scribe
c83883	to bring the book of the law of Moses,
c83884	which the LORD had commanded to Israel.
c83885	And Ezra the priest brought the law before the congregation both of men and women, and all
c83886	with understanding,
c83887	that could hear
c83888	upon the first day of the seventh month.
c83889	And he read therein before the street
c83890	that <i>was</i> before the water gate
c83891	from the morning until midday, before the men and the women, and those that could understand;
c83892	and the ears of all the people <i>were attentive</i> unto the book of the law.
c83893	And Ezra the scribe stood upon a pulpit of wood,
c83894	which they had made for the purpose;
c83895	and beside him stood Mattithiah, and Shema, and Anaiah, and Urijah, and Hilkiah, and Maaseiah, on his right hand;
c83896	and on his left hand, Pedaiah, and Mishael, and Malchiah, and Hashum, and Hashbadana, Zechariah, <i>and</i> Meshullam.
c83897	And Ezra opened the book in the sight of all the people;
c83898	(for he was above all the people;)
c83900	and when he opened
c83901	it, all the people stood up:
c83902	And Ezra blessed the LORD, the great God.
c83903	And all the people answered,
c83904	Amen, Amen,
c83905	with lifting up their hands:
c83906	and they bowed
c83907	their heads, and worshipped the LORD
c83908	with <i>their</i> faces to the ground.
c83909	Also Jeshua, and Bani, and Sherebiah, Jamin, Akkub, Shabbethai, Hodijah, Maaseiah, Kelita, Azariah, Jozabad, Hanan, Pelaiah, and the Levites, caused the people to understand the law:
c83910	and the people <i>stood</i> in their place.
c83911	So they read in the book in the law of God distinctly,
c83912	and gave the sense,
c83913	and caused <i>them</i> to understand the reading.
c83914	And Nehemiah, which <i>is</i> the Tirshatha,
c83916	and Ezra the priest the scribe, and the Levites
c83917	that taught the people, said
c83918	unto all the people,
c83920	This day <i>is</i> holy unto the LORD your God;
c83921	mourn not,
c83922	nor weep.
c83923	For all the people wept,
c83924	when they heard the words of the law.
c83925	Then he said
c83926	unto them, Go
c83927	your way, eat the fat,
c83928	and drink the sweet,
c83929	and send portions
c83930	unto them for whom nothing is prepared:
c83931	for <i>this</i> day <i>is</i> holy unto our Lord:
c83932	neither be ye sorry;
c83933	for the joy of the LORD
c83934	is your strength.
c83935	So the Levites stilled all the people,
c83936	saying,
c83937	Hold your peace,
c83938	for the day <i>is</i> holy;
c83939	neither be ye grieved.
c83940	And all the people went
c83941	their way to eat,
c83942	and to drink,
c83943	and to send portions,
c83944	and to make great mirth,
c83945	because they had understood the words
c83946	that were declared unto them.
c83947	And on the second day were gathered together the chief of the fathers of all the people, the priests, and the Levites, unto Ezra the scribe,
c83948	even to understand the words of the law.
c83949	And they found
c83950	written in the law
c83951	which the LORD had commanded by Moses,
c83952	that the children of Israel should dwell in booths in the feast of the seventh month:
c83953	And that they should publish
c83954	and proclaim in all their cities, and in Jerusalem,
c83955	saying,
c83956	Go forth unto the mount,
c83957	and fetch olive branches, and pine branches, and myrtle branches, and palm branches, and branches of thick trees,
c83958	to make booths, as <i>it is</i> written.
c83959	So the people went forth,
c83960	and brought
c83961	<i>them,</i> and made themselves booths,
c83962	every one upon the roof of his house,
c83963	and in their courts, and in the courts of the house of God, and in the street of the water gate, and in the street of the gate of Ephraim.
c83964	And all the congregation of them that were come again out of the captivity made
c83966	booths,
c83967	and sat under the booths:
c83968	for since the days of Jeshua the son of Nun unto that day had not the children of Israel done so.
c83969	And there was very great gladness.
c83970	Also day by day, from the first day unto the last day, he read in the book of the law of God.
c83971	And they kept the feast seven days;
c83972	and on the eighth day <i>was</i> a solemn assembly, according unto the manner.
c83973	Now in the twenty and fourth day of this month the children of Israel were assembled with fasting, and with sackclothes,
c83974	and earth upon them.
c83975	And the seed of Israel separated themselves from all strangers,
c83976	and stood
c83977	and confessed their sins, and the iniquities of their fathers.
c83978	And they stood up in their place,
c83979	and read in the book of the law of the LORD their God <i>one</i> fourth part of the day;
c83980	and <i>another</i> fourth part they confessed,
c83981	and worshipped the LORD their God.
c83982	Then stood up upon the stairs, of the Levites, Jeshua, and Bani, Kadmiel, Shebaniah, Bunni, Sherebiah, Bani, <i>and</i> Chenani,
c83983	and cried with a loud voice unto the LORD their God.
c83984	Then the Levites, Jeshua, and Kadmiel, Bani, Hashabniah, Sherebiah, Hodijah, Shebaniah, <i>and</i> Pethahiah, said,
c83985	Stand up
c83986	<i>and</i> bless the LORD your God for ever and ever:
c83987	and blessed be thy glorious name,
c83988	which is exalted above all blessing and praise.
c83989	Thou, <i>even</i> thou, <i>art</i> LORD alone;
c83990	thou hast made heaven, the heaven of heavens, with all their host,
c83991	the earth, and all
c83992	<i>things</i> that <i>are</i> therein,
c83993	the seas, and all
c83994	that
c83995	<i>is</i> therein, and thou preservest them all;
c83996	and the host of heaven worshippeth thee.
c83997	Thou <i>art</i> the LORD the God,
c83998	who didst choose Abram,
c83999	and broughtest him forth out of Ur of the Chaldees,
c84000	and gavest him the name of Abraham;
c84001	And foundest his heart
c84002	faithful before
c84003	thee, and madest a covenant with
c84004	him to give the land of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Jebusites, and the Girgashites,
c84005	to give <i>it, I say,</i> to his seed,
c84006	and hast performed thy words;
c84007	for thou <i>art</i> righteous:
c84008	And didst see the affliction of our fathers in Egypt,
c84009	and heardest their cry by the Red sea;
c84010	And shewedst signs and wonders upon Pharaoh, and on all his servants, and on all the people of his land:
c84011	for thou knewest
c84012	that they dealt proudly against
c84013	them. So didst thou get thee a name, as <i>it is</i> this day.
c84014	And thou didst divide the sea before
c84015	them, so that they went through the midst of the sea on the dry land;
c84016	and their persecutors thou threwest into the deeps,
c84017	as a stone into the mighty waters.
c84018	Moreover thou leddest them in the day by a cloudy pillar;
c84019	and in the night by a pillar of fire,
c84020	to give them light in the way
c84021	wherein they should go.
c84022	Thou camest down also upon mount Sinai,
c84023	and spakest with them from heaven,
c84024	and gavest them right judgments, and true laws, good statutes and commandments:
c84025	And madest known unto them thy holy sabbath,
c84026	and commandedst them precepts, statutes, and laws, by the hand of Moses thy servant:
c84027	And gavest them bread from heaven for their hunger,
c84028	and broughtest forth water for them out of the rock for their thirst,
c84029	and promisedst
c84030	them that they should go in
c84031	to possess the land
c84032	which thou hadst sworn
c84033	to give them.
c84034	But they and our fathers dealt proudly,
c84035	and hardened their necks,
c84036	and hearkened not to thy commandments,
c84037	And refused
c84038	to obey,
c84039	neither were mindful of thy wonders
c84040	that thou didst among
c84041	them; but hardened their necks,
c84043	and in their rebellion appointed a captain to return to their bondage:
c84044	but thou <i>art</i> a God ready to pardon,
c84045	gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and of great kindness,
c84046	and forsookest them not.
c84047	Yea, when they had made them a molten calf,
c84048	and said,
c84049	This <i>is</i> thy God
c84050	that brought thee up out of Egypt,
c84051	and had wrought great provocations;
c84052	Yet thou in thy manifold mercies forsookest them not in the wilderness:
c84053	the pillar of the cloud departed not from them by day,
c84054	to lead them in the way;
c84055	neither the pillar of fire by night,
c84056	to shew them light,
c84057	and the way
c84058	wherein they should go.
c84059	Thou gavest also thy good spirit
c84060	to instruct
c84061	them, and withheldest not thy manna from their mouth,
c84062	and gavest them water for their thirst.
c84063	Yea, forty years didst thou sustain them in the wilderness,
c84064	<i>so that</i> they lacked nothing;
c84065	their clothes waxed not old,
c84066	and their feet swelled not.
c84067	Moreover thou gavest them kingdoms and nations,
c84068	and didst divide them into corners:
c84069	so they possessed the land of Sihon, and the land of the king of Heshbon, and the land of Og king of Bashan.
c84070	Their children also multipliedst thou as the stars of heaven,
c84071	and broughtest them into the land,
c84072	concerning which thou hadst promised to their fathers,
c84073	that they should go in
c84074	to possess <i>it.</i>
c84075	So the children went in
c84076	and possessed the land,
c84077	and thou subduedst before them the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites,
c84078	and gavest them into their hands,
c84079	with their kings, and the people of the land,
c84080	that they might do with them as they would.
c84081	And they took strong cities, and a fat land,
c84082	and possessed houses
c84083	full of all goods,
c84084	wells digged, vineyards, and oliveyards, and fruit trees in abundance:
c84085	so they did eat,
c84086	and were filled,
c84087	and became fat,
c84088	and delighted themselves in thy great goodness.
c84089	Nevertheless they were disobedient,
c84090	and rebelled
c84091	against thee, and cast thy law behind their backs,
c84092	and slew thy prophets
c84093	which testified
c84094	against them to turn them to
c84095	thee, and they wrought great provocations.
c84096	Therefore thou deliveredst them into the hand of their enemies,
c84097	who vexed
c84098	them: and in the time of their trouble, when they cried unto
c84099	thee, thou heardest <i>them</i> from heaven;
c84100	and according to thy manifold mercies thou gavest them saviours,
c84101	who saved them out of the hand of their enemies.
c84103	But after they had rest,
c84105	they did evil again before
c84106	thee: therefore leftest thou them in the hand of their enemies,
c84107	so that they had the dominion
c84108	over them: yet when they returned,
c84109	and cried
c84110	unto thee, thou heardest <i>them</i> from heaven;
c84111	and many times didst thou deliver them according to thy mercies;
c84112	And testifiedst
c84113	against them, that thou mightest bring them again unto thy law:
c84114	yet they dealt proudly,
c84115	and hearkened not unto thy commandments,
c84116	but sinned against thy judgments,
c84117	(which if a man do,
c84118	he shall live
c84119	in them;) and withdrew the shoulder,
c84120	and hardened their neck,
c84121	and would not hear.
c84122	Yet many years didst thou forbear
c84123	them, and testifiedst against them by thy spirit in thy prophets:
c84124	yet would they not give ear:
c84125	therefore gavest thou them into the hand of the people of the lands.
c84126	Nevertheless for thy great mercies' sake thou didst not utterly consume
c84127	them, nor forsake
c84128	them; for thou <i>art</i> a gracious and merciful God.
c84129	Now
c84130	therefore, our God, the great, the mighty, and the terrible God,
c84131	who keepest covenant and mercy,
c84132	let not all the trouble seem little before
c84133	thee, that hath come upon us, on our kings, on our princes, and on our priests, and on our prophets, and on our fathers, and on all thy people,
c84134	since the time of the kings of Assyria unto this day.
c84135	Howbeit thou <i>art</i> just in all
c84136	that is brought upon
c84137	us; for thou hast done right,
c84138	but we have done wickedly:
c84139	Neither have our kings, our princes, our priests, nor our fathers, kept thy law,
c84140	nor hearkened unto thy commandments and thy testimonies,
c84141	wherewith thou didst testify against them.
c84142	For they have not served thee in their kingdom, and in thy great goodness
c84143	that thou gavest
c84144	them, and in the large and fat land
c84145	which thou gavest before
c84147	them, neither turned they from their wicked works.
c84148	Behold, we <i>are</i> servants this day,
c84149	and <i>for</i> the land
c84150	that thou gavest unto our fathers
c84151	to eat the fruit thereof and the good
c84152	thereof, behold, we <i>are</i> servants in it:
c84153	And it yieldeth much increase unto the kings
c84154	whom thou hast set over us because of our sins:
c84155	also they have dominion over our bodies,
c84156	and over our cattle, at their pleasure,
c84157	and we <i>are</i> in great distress.
c84158	And because of all this we make a sure
c84159	<i>covenant,</i> and write
c84160	<i>it;</i> and our princes, Levites, <i>and</i> priests, seal <i>unto it.</i>
c84161	Now those that sealed <i>were,</i> Nehemiah, the Tirshatha, the son of Hachaliah, and Zidkijah,
c84162	Seraiah, Azariah, Jeremiah,
c84163	Pashur, Amariah, Malchijah,
c84164	Hattush, Shebaniah, Malluch,
c84165	Harim, Meremoth, Obadiah,
c84166	Daniel, Ginnethon, Baruch,
c84167	Meshullam, Abijah, Mijamin,
c84168	Maaziah, Bilgai, Shemaiah:
c84169	these <i>were</i> the priests.
c84170	And the Levites:
c84171	both Jeshua the son of Azaniah, Binnui
c84172	of the sons of Henadad, Kadmiel;
c84173	And their brethren,
c84174	Shebaniah, Hodijah, Kelita, Pelaiah, Hanan,
c84175	Micha, Rehob, Hashabiah,
c84176	Zaccur, Sherebiah, Shebaniah,
c84177	Hodijah, Bani, Beninu.
c84178	The chief of the people;
c84179	Parosh, Pahathmoab, Elam, Zatthu, Bani,
c84180	Bunni, Azgad, Bebai,
c84181	Adonijah, Bigvai, Adin,
c84182	Ater, Hizkijah, Azzur,
c84183	Hodijah, Hashum, Bezai,
c84184	Hariph, Anathoth, Nebai,
c84185	Magpiash, Meshullam, Hezir,
c84186	Meshezabeel, Zadok, Jaddua,
c84187	Pelatiah, Hanan, Anaiah,
c84188	Hoshea, Hananiah, Hashub,
c84189	Hallohesh, Pileha, Shobek,
c84190	Rehum, Hashabnah, Maaseiah,
c84191	And Ahijah, Hanan, Anan,
c84192	Malluch, Harim, Baanah.
c84193	And the rest of the people, the priests, the Levites, the porters, the singers, the Nethinims, and all
c84194	they that had separated themselves from the people of the lands unto the law of God,
c84195	their wives, their sons, and their daughters, every
c84196	one having knowledge,
c84197	and having understanding;
c84198	They clave to their brethren, their nobles,
c84199	and entered into a curse, and into an oath,
c84200	to walk in God's law,
c84201	which was given by Moses the servant of God,
c84202	and to observe
c84203	and do all the commandments of the LORD our Lord, and his judgments and his statutes;
c84204	And that we would not give our daughters unto the people of the land,
c84205	nor take their daughters for our sons:
c84206	And <i>if</i> the people of the land
c84207	bring ware or any victuals on the sabbath day
c84208	to sell,
c84209	<i>that</i> we would not buy it of them on the sabbath, or on the holy day:
c84210	and <i>that</i> we would leave the seventh year, and the exaction of every debt.
c84211	Also we made ordinances for
c84212	us, to charge ourselves yearly with the third part of a shekel for the service of the house of our God;
c84213	For the shewbread, and for the continual meat offering, and for the continual burnt offering, of the sabbaths, of the new moons, for the set feasts, and for the holy <i>things,</i> and for the sin offerings
c84214	to make an atonement for Israel,
c84215	and <i>for</i> all the work of the house of our God.
c84216	And we cast the lots among the priests, the Levites, and the people, for the wood offering,
c84218	to bring <i>it</i> into the house of our God, after the houses of our fathers, at times appointed year by year,
c84219	to burn upon the altar of the LORD our God,
c84220	as <i>it is</i> written in the law:
c84221	And to bring the firstfruits of our ground, and the firstfruits of all fruit of all trees, year by year, unto the house of the LORD:
c84222	Also the firstborn of our sons, and of our cattle,
c84223	as <i>it is</i> written in the law,
c84224	and the firstlings of our herds and of our flocks,
c84225	to bring to the house of our God, unto the priests
c84226	that minister in the house of our God:
c84227	And <i>that</i> we should bring the firstfruits of our dough, and our offerings, and the fruit of all manner of trees, of wine and of oil, unto the priests, to the chambers of the house of our God;
c84228	and the tithes of our ground unto the Levites,
c84229	that the same Levites
c84230	might have the tithes in all the cities of our tillage.
c84231	And the priest the son of Aaron shall be with the Levites,
c84232	when the Levites take tithes:
c84233	and the Levites shall bring up the tithe of the tithes unto the house of our God, to the chambers, into the treasure house.
c84234	For the children of Israel and the children of Levi shall bring the offering of the corn, of the new wine, and the oil, unto the chambers,
c84235	where <i>are</i> the vessels of the sanctuary, and the priests
c84236	that minister,
c84237	and the porters, and the singers:
c84238	and we will not forsake the house of our God.
c84239	And the rulers of the people dwelt at Jerusalem:
c84240	the rest of the people also cast lots,
c84241	to bring one of ten
c84242	to dwell in Jerusalem the holy city,
c84243	and nine parts <i>to dwell</i> in <i>other</i> cities.
c84244	And the people blessed all the men,
c84245	that willingly offered themselves
c84246	to dwell at Jerusalem.
c84247	Now these <i>are</i> the chief of the province
c84248	that dwelt in Jerusalem:
c84249	but in the cities of Judah dwelt
c84250	every one in his possession
c84251	in their cities, <i>to wit,</i> Israel, the priests, and the Levites, and the Nethinims, and the children of Solomon's servants.
c84252	And at Jerusalem dwelt <i>certain</i> of the children of Judah, and of the children of Benjamin.

c84280	And Shabbethai and Jozabad,
c84281	<i>had</i> the oversight of the outward business of the house of God.
c84282	of the chief of the Levites,
c84283	And Mattaniah the son of Micha, the son of Zabdi, the son of Asaph, <i>was</i> the principal to begin
c84284	the thanksgiving in prayer:
c84285	and Bakbukiah
c84286	the second among his brethren,
c84287	and Abda the son of Shammua, the son of Galal, the son of Jeduthun.
c84288	All the Levites in the holy city <i>were</i> two hundred fourscore and four.
c84289	Moreover the porters, Akkub, Talmon, and their brethren
c84290	that kept the gates,

c84292	And the residue of Israel, of the priests, <i>and</i> the Levites, <i>were</i> in all the cities of Judah,

c84297	Of the sons of Asaph, the singers

c84299	For <i>it was</i> the king's commandment concerning
c84300	them, that a certain portion should be for the singers, due for every day.
c84301	And Pethahiah the son of Meshezabeel, of the children of Zerah the son of Judah, <i>was</i> at the king's hand in all matters concerning the people.
c84302	And for the villages, with their fields,
c84303	<i>some</i> of the children of Judah dwelt at Kirjatharba, and <i>in</i> the villages thereof, and at Dibon, and <i>in</i> the villages thereof, and at Jekabzeel, and <i>in</i> the villages thereof,

c84360	also the priests, to the reign of Darius the Persian.
c84361	The sons of Levi,
c84362	the chief of the fathers, <i>were</i> written in the book of the chronicles, even until the days
c84363	of Johanan the son of Eliashib.
c84364	And the chief of the Levites: Hashabiah, Sherebiah, and Jeshua the son of Kadmiel,
c84365	with their brethren over against
c84366	them, to praise
c84367	<i>and</i> to give thanks,
c84368	according to the commandment of David the man of God, ward over against ward.
c84369	Mattaniah, and Bakbukiah, Obadiah, Meshullam, Talmon, Akkub, <i>were</i> porters keeping the ward at the thresholds of the gates.
c84370	These <i>were</i> in the days of Joiakim the son of Jeshua, the son of Jozadak, and in the days of Nehemiah the governor, and of Ezra the priest, the scribe.
c84371	And at the dedication of the wall of Jerusalem they sought the Levites out of all their places,
c84372	to bring them to Jerusalem,
c84373	to keep the dedication with gladness,
c84374	both with thanksgivings, and with singing, <i>with</i> cymbals, psalteries, and with harps.
c84375	And the sons of the singers gathered themselves together,
c84376	both out of the plain country round about Jerusalem,
c84377	and from the villages of Netophathi;
c84378	Also from the house of Gilgal,
c84379	and out of the fields of Geba and Azmaveth:
c84380	for the singers had builded them villages round about Jerusalem.
c84381	And the priests and the Levites purified themselves,
c84382	and purified the people, and the gates, and the wall.
c84383	Then I brought up the princes of Judah upon the wall,
c84384	and appointed two great <i>companies of them that gave</i> thanks,
c84385	<i>whereof one</i> went on the right hand upon the wall toward the dung gate:
c84386	And after them went Hoshaiah, and half of the princes of Judah,
c84387	And Azariah, Ezra, and Meshullam,
c84388	Judah, and Benjamin, and Shemaiah, and Jeremiah,
c84389	And <i>certain</i> of the priests' sons with trumpets; <i>namely,</i> Zechariah the son of Jonathan, the son of Shemaiah, the son of Mattaniah, the son of Michaiah, the son of Zaccur, the son of Asaph:
c84390	And his brethren, Shemaiah, and Azarael, Milalai, Gilalai, Maai, Nethaneel, and Judah, Hanani, with the musical instruments of David the man of God,
c84391	and Ezra the scribe before them.
c84392	And at the fountain gate,
c84393	which was over against them, they went up by the stairs of the city of David, at the going up of the wall, above the house of David, even unto the water gate eastward.
c84394	And the other <i>company of them that gave</i> thanks
c84395	went over against
c84396	<i>them,</i> and I after them, and the half of the people
c84397	upon the wall, from beyond the tower of the furnaces even unto the broad wall;
c84398	And from above the gate of Ephraim, and above the old gate, and above the fish gate, and the tower of Hananeel, and the tower of Meah, even unto the sheep gate:
c84399	and they stood still in the prison gate.
c84400	So stood the two <i>companies of them that gave</i> thanks in the house of God,
c84401	and I,
c84402	and the half of the rulers with me:
c84403	And the priests; Eliakim, Maaseiah, Miniamin, Michaiah, Elioenai, Zechariah, <i>and</i> Hananiah, with trumpets;
c84404	And Maaseiah, and Shemaiah, and Eleazar, and Uzzi, and Jehohanan, and Malchijah, and Elam, and Ezer.
c84405	And the singers sang loud, with Jezrahiah <i>their</i> overseer.
c84406	Also that day they offered great sacrifices,
c84407	and rejoiced:
c84408	for God had made them rejoice with great joy:
c84409	the wives also and the children rejoiced:
c84410	so that the joy of Jerusalem was heard even afar off.
c84411	And at that time were some appointed over the chambers for the treasures, for the offerings, for the firstfruits, and for the tithes,
c84412	to gather into them out of the fields of the cities the portions of the law for the priests and Levites:
c84413	for Judah rejoiced for the priests and for the Levites
c84414	that waited.
c84415	kept the ward of their God, and the ward of the purification,
c84416	And both the singers and the porters
c84417	according to the commandment of David, <i>and</i> of Solomon his son.
c84418	For in the days of David and Asaph of old <i>there were</i> chief of the singers, and songs of praise and thanksgiving unto God.
c84419	And all Israel in the days of Zerubbabel, and in the days of Nehemiah, gave the portions of the singers and the porters, every day his portion:
c84420	and they sanctified <i>holy things</i> unto the Levites;
c84421	and the Levites sanctified <i>them</i> unto the children of Aaron.
c84422	On that day they read in the book of Moses in the audience of the people;
c84423	and therein was found
c84424	written,
c84425	that the Ammonite and the Moabite should not come into the congregation of God for ever;
c84426	Because they met not the children of Israel with bread and with water,
c84427	but hired Balaam against
c84428	them, that he should curse
c84429	them: howbeit our God turned the curse into a blessing.
c84430	Now it came to pass,
c84431	when they had heard the law,
c84432	that they separated from Israel all the mixed multitude.
c84433	And before this, Eliashib the priest,
c84434	having the oversight of the chamber of the house of our God,
c84435	<i>was</i> allied unto Tobiah:
c84436	And he had prepared for him a great chamber,
c84437	where aforetime they laid the meat offerings, the frankincense, and the vessels, and the tithes of the corn, the new wine, and the oil,
c84438	which was commanded <i>to be given</i> to the Levites, and the singers, and the porters; and the offerings of the priests.
c84439	But in all this <i>time</i> was not I at Jerusalem:
c84440	for in the two and thirtieth year of Artaxerxes king of Babylon came I unto the king,
c84441	and after certain days obtained I leave of the king:
c84442	And I came to Jerusalem,
c84443	and understood of the evil
c84444	that Eliashib did for Tobiah,
c84445	in preparing him a chamber in the courts of the house of God.
c84446	And it grieved me sore:
c84447	therefore I cast forth all the household stuff of Tobiah out of the chamber.
c84448	Then I commanded,
c84449	and they cleansed the chambers:
c84450	and thither brought I again the vessels of the house of God, with the meat offering and the frankincense.
c84451	And I perceived
c84452	that the portions of the Levites had not been given
c84453	were fled
c84454	every one to his field.
c84455	<i>them:</i> for the Levites and the singers,
c84456	that did the work,
c84457	Then contended I with the rulers,
c84458	and said,
c84459	Why is the house of God forsaken?
c84460	And I gathered them together,
c84461	and set them in their place.
c84462	Then brought all Judah the tithe of the corn and the new wine and the oil unto the treasuries.
c84463	And I made treasurers over the treasuries, Shelemiah the priest, and Zadok the scribe, and of the Levites, Pedaiah:
c84464	and next to them <i>was</i> Hanan the son of Zaccur, the son of Mattaniah:
c84465	for they were counted faithful,
c84466	and their office
c84467	<i>was</i> to distribute unto their brethren.
c84468	Remember
c84469	me, O my God,
c84470	concerning this,
c84471	and wipe not out my good deeds
c84472	that I have done for the house of my God, and for the offices thereof.
c84473	In those days saw I in Judah
c84474	<i>some</i> treading wine presses on the sabbath,
c84475	and bringing in sheaves,
c84476	and lading asses;
c84477	as also wine, grapes, and figs, and all <i>manner of</i> burdens,
c84478	which they brought into Jerusalem on the sabbath day:
c84479	and I testified <i>against them</i> in the day
c84480	wherein they sold victuals.
c84481	men of Tyre
c84482	There dwelt
c84483	also therein, which brought fish, and all manner of ware,
c84484	and sold on the sabbath unto the children of Judah,
c84485	and in Jerusalem.
c84486	Then I contended with the nobles of Judah,
c84487	and said
c84488	unto them, What evil thing <i>is</i> this
c84489	that ye do,
c84490	and profane the sabbath day?
c84491	Did not your fathers thus,
c84492	and did not our God bring all this evil upon us, and upon this city?
c84493	yet ye bring more wrath upon Israel
c84494	by profaning the sabbath.
c84495	And it came to pass,
c84496	that when the gates of Jerusalem began to be dark before the sabbath,
c84497	I commanded
c84498	that the gates should be shut,
c84499	and charged
c84500	that they should not be opened till after the sabbath:
c84501	and <i>some</i> of my servants set I at the gates,
c84502	<i>that</i> there should no burden be brought in on the sabbath day.
c84503	So the merchants and sellers of all kind of ware lodged without Jerusalem once or twice.
c84504	Then I testified
c84505	against them, and said unto
c84506	them, Why lodge ye about the wall?
c84507	if ye do <i>so</i> again,
c84508	I will lay hands
c84509	on you. From that time forth came they no <i>more</i> on the sabbath.
c84510	And I commanded the Levites
c84511	that they should cleanse themselves,
c84512	and <i>that</i> they should come
c84513	<i>and</i> keep the gates,
c84514	to sanctify the sabbath day.
c84515	Remember me, O my God, <i>concerning</i> this also,
c84517	and spare me according to the greatness of thy mercy.
c84518	In those days also saw I Jews
c84519	<i>that</i> had married wives of Ashdod, of Ammon, <i>and</i> of Moab:
c84520	And their children
c84521	spake half in the speech of Ashdod,
c84522	and could not
c84523	speak in the Jews' language,
c84524	but according to the language of each people.
c84525	And I contended with
c84526	them, and cursed
c84527	them, and smote certain
c84529	and made them swear by God,
c84530	<i>saying,</i> Ye shall not give your daughters unto their sons, nor take their daughters unto your sons, or for yourselves.
c84531	of them, and plucked off their hair,
c84532	Did not Solomon king of Israel sin by these things?
c84533	yet among many nations was there no king like him,
c84534	who was beloved of his God,
c84535	and God made him king over all Israel:
c84536	nevertheless even him did outlandish women cause to sin.
c84538	Shall we then hearken
c84539	unto you to do all this great evil,
c84540	to transgress against our God
c84541	in marrying strange wives?
c84542	And <i>one</i> of the sons of Joiada, the son of Eliashib the high priest, <i>was</i> son in law to Sanballat the Horonite:
c84543	therefore I chased him from me.
c84544	Remember
c84545	them, O my God,
c84546	because they have defiled the priesthood, and the covenant of the priesthood, and of the Levites.
c84547	Thus cleansed I them from all strangers,
c84548	and appointed the wards of the priests and the Levites,
c84549	every one in his business;
c84550	And for the wood offering, at times appointed, and for the firstfruits.
c84551	Remember
c84552	me, O my God,
c84553	for good.
c84554	Adam, Sheth, Enosh,
c84555	Kenan, Mahalaleel, Jered,
c84556	Henoch, Methuselah, Lamech,
c84557	Noah, Shem, Ham, and Japheth.
c84558	The sons of Japheth; Gomer, and Magog, and Madai, and Javan, and Tubal, and Meshech, and Tiras.

c84564	And Cush begat Nimrod:
c84565	he began
c84566	to be mighty upon the earth.
c84567	And Mizraim begat Ludim, and Anamim, and Lehabim, and Naphtuhim,
c84568	And Pathrusim, and Casluhim,

c84576	And Arphaxad begat Shelah,
c84577	and Shelah begat Eber.
c84578	And unto Eber were born two sons:
c84579	the name of the one <i>was</i> Peleg;
c84580	because in his days the earth was divided:
c84581	and his brother's name <i>was</i> Joktan.
c84582	And Joktan begat Almodad, and Sheleph, and Hazarmaveth, and Jerah,
c84583	Hadoram also, and Uzal, and Diklah,
c84584	And Ebal, and Abimael, and Sheba,

c84588	Eber, Peleg, Reu,
c84589	Serug, Nahor, Terah,

c84591	the same <i>is</i> Abraham.
c84592	The sons of Abraham; Isaac, and Ishmael.
c84593	These <i>are</i> their generations:

c84596	Mishma, and Dumah, Massa, Hadad, and Tema,
c84597	Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah.
c84598	These
c84599	are the sons of Ishmael.
c84600	Now the sons of Keturah, Abraham's concubine:
c84601	she bare Zimran, and Jokshan, and Medan, and Midian, and Ishbak, and Shuah.
c84602	And the sons of Jokshan; Sheba, and Dedan.
c84603	And the sons of Midian; Ephah, and Epher, and Henoch, and Abida, and Eldaah.
c84604	All these <i>are</i> the sons of Keturah.

c84619	Now these <i>are</i> the kings
c84620	that reigned in the land of Edom
c84621	before <i>any</i> king reigned over the children of Israel;
c84622	Bela the son of Beor:
c84623	and the name of his city <i>was</i> Dinhabah.
c84624	And when Bela was dead,
c84625	Jobab the son of Zerah of Bozrah reigned in his stead.
c84626	And when Jobab was dead,
c84627	Husham of the land of the Temanites reigned in his stead.

c84687	And Hur begat Uri,

c84689	And afterward Hezron went in to the daughter of Machir the father of Gilead,

c84898	mentioned by <i>their</i> names
c84899	<i>were</i> princes in their families:
c84900	and the house of their fathers increased greatly.
c84901	And they went to the entrance of Gedor, <i>even</i> unto the east side of the valley,
c84902	to seek pasture for their flocks.
c84903	And they found fat pasture and good,
c84904	and the land <i>was</i> wide, and quiet, and peaceable;
c84905	for <i>they</i> of Ham
c84906	had dwelt there of old.
c84907	And these written by name came
c84909	in the days of Hezekiah king of Judah,
c84910	and smote their tents, and the habitations
c84911	that were found there,
c84912	and destroyed them utterly unto this day,
c84913	and dwelt in their rooms:
c84914	because <i>there was</i> pasture there for their flocks.
c84915	And <i>some</i> of them, <i>even</i> of the sons of Simeon, five hundred men, went to mount Seir,
c84916	having for their captains Pelatiah, and Neariah, and Rephaiah, and Uzziel, the sons of Ishi.
c84917	And they smote the rest of the Amalekites that were escaped,
c84918	and dwelt there unto this day.
c84919	Now the sons of Reuben the firstborn of Israel,
c84920	(for he <i>was</i> the firstborn;
c84922	but, forasmuch as he defiled his father's bed,
c84923	his birthright was given unto the sons of Joseph the son of Israel:
c84924	and the genealogy is not to be reckoned after the birthright.
c84925	For Judah prevailed above his brethren,
c84926	and of him <i>came</i> the chief ruler;
c84927	but the birthright <i>was</i> Joseph's:)
c84928	The sons, <i>I say,</i> of Reuben the firstborn of Israel <i>were,</i> Hanoch, and Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi.
c84929	The sons of Joel; Shemaiah his son, Gog his son, Shimei his son,

c84933	<i>captive:</i> he <i>was</i> prince of the Reubenites.
c84934	And his brethren by their families,
c84935	when the genealogy of their generations
c84936	was reckoned, <i>were</i> the chief, Jeiel, and Zechariah,
c84937	And Bela the son of Azaz, the son of Shema, the son of Joel,
c84938	who dwelt in Aroer, even unto Nebo and Baalmeon:
c84939	And eastward he inhabited
c84940	unto the entering in of the wilderness from the river Euphrates:
c84941	because their cattle were multiplied in the land of Gilead.
c84942	And in the days of Saul they made war with the Hagarites,
c84943	who fell by their hand:
c84944	and they dwelt in their tents throughout all the east <i>land</i> of Gilead.
c84945	And the children of Gad dwelt over against them, in the land of Bashan unto Salchah:
c84946	Joel the chief, and Shapham the next, and Jaanai, and Shaphat in Bashan.
c84947	And their brethren of the house of their fathers <i>were,</i> Michael, and Meshullam, and Sheba, and Jorai, and Jachan, and Zia, and Heber, seven.
c84948	These <i>are</i> the children of Abihail the son of Huri, the son of Jaroah, the son of Gilead, the son of Michael, the son of Jeshishai, the son of Jahdo, the son of Buz;
c84949	Ahi the son of Abdiel, the son of Guni, chief of the house of their fathers.
c84950	And they dwelt in Gilead in Bashan, and in her towns, and in all the suburbs of Sharon, upon their borders.
c84951	All these were reckoned by genealogies in the days of Jotham king of Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam king of Israel.
c84952	The sons of Reuben, and the Gadites, and half the tribe of Manasseh, of valiant men, men
c84953	able to bear buckler and sword,
c84954	and to shoot with bow,
c84955	and skilful in war,
c84956	<i>were</i> four and forty thousand seven hundred and threescore,
c84957	that went out to the war.
c84958	And they made war with the Hagarites, with Jetur, and Nephish, and Nodab.
c84959	And they were helped against
c84960	them, and the Hagarites were delivered into their hand, and all
c84961	that <i>were</i> with
c84962	them: for they cried to God in the battle,
c84963	and he was intreated
c84964	of them; because they put their trust in him.
c84965	And they took away their cattle; of their camels fifty thousand, and of sheep two hundred and fifty thousand, and of asses two thousand, and of men an hundred thousand.
c84966	For there fell down many slain,
c84967	because the war <i>was</i> of God.
c84968	And they dwelt in their steads until the captivity.
c84969	And the children of the half tribe of Manasseh dwelt in the land:
c84970	they increased from Bashan unto Baalhermon and Senir, and unto mount Hermon.
c84971	And these <i>were</i> the heads of the house of their fathers,
c84972	even Epher, and Ishi, and Eliel, and Azriel, and Jeremiah, and Hodaviah, and Jahdiel,
c84973	mighty men of valour,
c84974	famous men, <i>and</i> heads of the house of their fathers.
c84975	And they transgressed against the God of their fathers,
c84976	and went a whoring after the gods of the people of the land,
c84977	whom God destroyed before them.
c84978	And the God of Israel stirred up the spirit of Pul king of Assyria, and the spirit of Tilgathpilneser king of Assyria,
c84979	and he carried them away, even the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and the half tribe of Manasseh,
c84980	and brought them unto Halah, and Habor, and Hara, and to the river Gozan, unto this day.
c84981	The sons of Levi; Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.
c84982	And the sons of Kohath; Amram, Izhar, and Hebron, and Uzziel.
c84983	And the children of Amram; Aaron, and Moses, and Miriam.

c84999	<i>it is</i> that executed the priest's office in the temple
c85000	that Solomon built in Jerusalem:)
c85001	And Azariah begat Amariah,

c85006	and Hilkiah begat Azariah,
c85007	And Azariah begat Seraiah,
c85008	and Seraiah begat Jehozadak,
c85009	And Jehozadak went
c85010	<i>into captivity,</i> when the LORD carried away Judah and Jerusalem by the hand of Nebuchadnezzar.
c85011	The sons of Levi; Gershom, Kohath, and Merari.
c85012	And these <i>be</i> the names of the sons of Gershom;

c85031	And they ministered before the dwelling place of the tabernacle of the congregation with singing,
c85032	until Solomon had built the house of the LORD in Jerusalem:
c85033	and <i>then</i> they waited on their office according to their order.
c85034	And these

c85256	All these <i>are</i> of the sons of Benjamin.
c85257	So all Israel were reckoned by genealogies;
c85258	and, behold, they <i>were</i> written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah,
c85259	<i>who</i> were carried away to Babylon for their transgression.
c85260	Now the first inhabitants
c85261	that <i>dwelt</i> in their possessions in their cities
c85262	<i>were,</i> the Israelites, the priests, Levites, and the Nethinims.
c85263	And in Jerusalem dwelt of the children of Judah, and of the children of Benjamin, and of the children of Ephraim, and Manasseh;

c85275	very able men for the work of the service of the house of God.
c85276	And of the Levites; Shemaiah the son of Hasshub, the son of Azrikam, the son of Hashabiah, of the sons of Merari;
c85277	And Bakbakkar, Heresh, and Galal, and Mattaniah the son of Micah, the son of Zichri, the son of Asaph;
c85278	And Obadiah the son of Shemaiah, the son of Galal, the son of Jeduthun, and Berechiah the son of Asa, the son of Elkanah,
c85279	that dwelt in the villages of the Netophathites.
c85280	And the porters <i>were,</i> Shallum, and Akkub, and Talmon, and Ahiman,
c85281	and their brethren: Shallum <i>was</i> the chief;
c85282	Who hitherto <i>waited</i> in the king's gate eastward:
c85283	they <i>were</i> porters in the companies of the children of Levi.
c85284	And Shallum the son of Kore, the son of Ebiasaph, the son of Korah, and his brethren, of the house of his father, the Korahites, <i>were</i> over the work of the service,
c85285	keepers of the gates of the tabernacle:
c85286	and their fathers, <i>being</i> over the host of the LORD,
c85287	<i>were</i> keepers of the entry.
c85288	And Phinehas the son of Eleazar was the ruler over them in time past,
c85289	<i>and</i> the LORD <i>was</i> with him.
c85290	<i>And</i> Zechariah the son of Meshelemiah <i>was</i> porter of the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.
c85291	All
c85292	these <i>which were</i> chosen to be porters in the gates
c85293	<i>were</i> two hundred and twelve.
c85294	These
c85295	were reckoned by their genealogy in their villages,
c85296	whom David and Samuel the seer did ordain in their set office.
c85297	So they and their children <i>had</i> the oversight of the gates of the house of the LORD, <i>namely,</i> the house of the tabernacle, by wards.
c85298	In four quarters were the porters, toward the east, west, north, and south.
c85299	And their brethren, <i>which were</i> in their villages,
c85300	<i>were</i> to come after seven days from time to time with them.
c85301	For these Levites, the four chief porters, were in <i>their</i> set office,
c85303	and were over the chambers and treasuries of the house of God.
c85304	And they lodged round about the house of God,
c85305	because the charge <i>was</i> upon them,
c85306	and the opening thereof every morning <i>pertained</i> to them.
c85308	And <i>certain</i> of them had the charge of the ministering vessels,
c85309	that they should bring them in and out by tale.
c85311	<i>Some</i> of them also <i>were</i> appointed to oversee the vessels, and all the instruments of the sanctuary, and the fine flour, and the wine, and the oil, and the frankincense, and the spices.
c85312	And <i>some</i> of the sons of the priests made the ointment of the spices.
c85313	And Mattithiah, <i>one</i> of the Levites,
c85314	who <i>was</i> the firstborn of Shallum the Korahite,
c85315	had the set office over the things that were made in the pans.
c85316	And <i>other</i> of their brethren, of the sons of the Kohathites, <i>were</i> over the shewbread,
c85317	to prepare <i>it</i> every sabbath.
c85318	And these <i>are</i> the singers,
c85319	chief of the fathers of the Levites,
c85320	<i>who remaining</i> in the chambers <i>were</i> free:
c85321	for they were employed in <i>that</i> work day and night.
c85322	These chief fathers of the Levites <i>were</i> chief throughout their generations;
c85323	these
c85324	dwelt at Jerusalem.
c85325	And in Gibeon dwelt the father of Gibeon, Jehiel,
c85326	whose wife's name <i>was</i> Maachah:
c85327	And his firstborn son Abdon,
c85328	then Zur, and Kish, and Baal, and Ner, and Nadab,
c85329	And Gedor, and Ahio, and Zechariah, and Mikloth.
c85330	And Mikloth begat Shimeam.
c85331	And they also dwelt with their brethren at Jerusalem, over against their brethren.
c85332	And Ner begat Kish;
c85333	and Kish begat Saul;
c85334	and Saul begat Jonathan, and Malchishua, and Abinadab, and Eshbaal.
c85335	And the son of Jonathan <i>was</i> Meribbaal:
c85336	and Meribbaal begat Micah.
c85337	And the sons of Micah <i>were,</i> Pithon, and Melech, and Tahrea, <i>and Ahaz.</i>
c85338	And Ahaz begat Jarah;
c85339	and Jarah begat Alemeth, and Azmaveth, and Zimri;
c85340	and Zimri begat Moza;
c85341	And Moza begat Binea;
c85342	and Rephaiah his son,
c85343	Eleasah his son,
c85344	Azel his son.
c85345	And Azel had six sons,
c85346	whose names <i>are</i> these,
c85347	Azrikam, Bocheru, and Ishmael, and Sheariah, and Obadiah, and Hanan:
c85348	these <i>were</i> the sons of Azel.
c85349	Now the Philistines fought against Israel;
c85350	and the men of Israel fled from before the Philistines,
c85351	and fell down slain in mount Gilboa.
c85352	And the Philistines followed hard after Saul, and after his sons;
c85353	and the Philistines slew Jonathan, and Abinadab, and Malchishua, the sons of Saul.
c85354	And the battle went sore against Saul,
c85355	hit
c85356	and the archers
c85357	him, and he was wounded of the archers.
c85358	Then said Saul to his armourbearer,
c85359	Draw thy sword,
c85360	and thrust me through
c85361	therewith; lest these uncircumcised come
c85362	and abuse
c85363	me. But his armourbearer would not;
c85364	for he was sore afraid.
c85365	So Saul took a sword,
c85366	and fell upon it.
c85367	And when his armourbearer saw
c85368	that Saul was dead,
c85369	he fell likewise on the sword,
c85370	and died.
c85371	So Saul died, and his three sons,
c85372	and all his house died together.
c85373	And when all the men of Israel that <i>were</i> in the valley saw
c85375	that they fled,
c85376	and that Saul and his sons were dead,
c85377	then they forsook their cities,
c85378	and fled:
c85379	and the Philistines came
c85380	and dwelt in them.
c85381	And it came to pass on the morrow,
c85382	when the Philistines came
c85383	to strip the slain,
c85384	that they found Saul and his sons
c85385	fallen in mount Gilboa.
c85386	And when they had stripped
c85387	him, they took his head, and his armour,
c85388	and sent into the land of the Philistines round about,
c85389	to carry tidings unto their idols, and to the people.
c85390	And they put his armour in the house of their gods,
c85391	and fastened his head in the temple of Dagon.
c85392	And when all Jabeshgilead heard all
c85393	that the Philistines had done to Saul,
c85394	They arose, all the valiant men,
c85395	and took away the body of Saul, and the bodies of his sons,
c85396	and brought them to Jabesh,
c85397	and buried their bones under the oak in Jabesh,
c85398	and fasted seven days.
c85399	So Saul died for his transgression which he committed
c85400	against the LORD,
c85401	<i>even</i> against the word of the LORD,
c85402	which he kept not,
c85403	and also for asking <i>counsel</i> of <i>one that had</i> a familiar spirit,
c85404	to enquire <i>of it;</i>
c85405	And enquired not of the LORD:
c85406	therefore he slew
c85407	him, and turned the kingdom unto David the son of Jesse.
c85408	Then all Israel gathered themselves to David unto Hebron,
c85409	saying,
c85410	Behold, we <i>are</i> thy bone and thy flesh.
c85411	And moreover in time past,
c85412	even when Saul was king,
c85413	thou
c85414	<i>wast</i> he that leddest out
c85415	and broughtest in Israel:
c85416	and the LORD thy God said
c85417	unto thee, Thou shalt feed my people Israel,
c85418	and thou shalt be ruler over my people Israel.
c85419	Therefore came all the elders of Israel to the king to Hebron;
c85420	and David made a covenant with them in Hebron before the LORD;
c85421	and they anointed David king over Israel, according to the word of the LORD by Samuel.
c85422	And David and all Israel went to Jerusalem,
c85423	which <i>is</i> Jebus;
c85424	where the Jebusites <i>were,</i> the inhabitants of the land.
c85425	And the inhabitants of Jebus said to David,
c85426	Thou shalt not come hither.
c85427	Nevertheless David took the castle of Zion,
c85428	which <i>is</i> the city of David.
c85429	And David said,
c85430	Whosoever
c85431	smiteth the Jebusites first
c85432	shall be chief and captain.
c85433	So Joab the son of Zeruiah went first up,
c85434	and was chief.
c85435	And David dwelt in the castle;
c85436	therefore they called it the city of David.
c85437	And he built the city round about, even from Millo round about:
c85438	and Joab repaired the rest of the city.
c85439	So David waxed greater and greater:
c85440	for the LORD of hosts <i>was</i> with him.
c85441	These also <i>are</i> the chief of the mighty men
c85442	whom David
c85443	had, who strengthened themselves with him in his kingdom, <i>and</i> with all Israel,
c85444	to make him king, according to the word of the LORD concerning Israel.
c85445	And this <i>is</i> the number of the mighty men
c85446	whom David
c85447	had; Jashobeam, an Hachmonite, the chief of the captains:
c85448	he lifted up his spear against three hundred
c85449	slain <i>by him</i> at one time.
c85450	And after him <i>was</i> Eleazar the son of Dodo, the Ahohite,
c85451	who <i>was one</i> of the three mighties.
c85452	He was with David at Pasdammim,
c85453	and there the Philistines were gathered together to battle,
c85454	where was a parcel of ground
c85455	full of barley;
c85456	and the people fled from before the Philistines.
c85457	And they set themselves in the midst of <i>that</i> parcel,
c85458	and delivered
c85459	it, and slew the Philistines;
c85460	and the LORD saved <i>them</i> by a great deliverance.
c85461	Now three of the thirty captains went down to the rock to David, into the cave of Adullam;
c85462	and the host of the Philistines encamped in the valley of Rephaim.
c85463	And David <i>was</i> then in the hold,
c85464	and the Philistines' garrison <i>was</i> then at Bethlehem.
c85465	And David longed,
c85466	and said,
c85467	Oh that one would give me drink of the water of the well of Bethlehem,
c85468	that <i>is</i> at the gate!
c85469	And the three brake through the host of the Philistines,
c85470	and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem,
c85471	that <i>was</i> by the gate,
c85472	and took
c85473	<i>it,</i> and brought <i>it</i> to David:
c85474	but David would not
c85475	drink
c85476	<i>of</i> it, but poured it out to the LORD,
c85477	And said,
c85478	My God forbid it
c85479	me, that I should do this thing:
c85480	shall I drink the blood of these men that have put their lives
c85481	in jeopardy? for with <i>the jeopardy of</i> their lives they brought
c85482	it. Therefore he would not
c85483	drink
c85484	it. These things did these three mightiest.
c85485	And Abishai the brother of Joab,
c85486	he was chief of the three:
c85487	for lifting up his spear against three hundred, he slew
c85488	<i>them,</i> and had a name among the three.
c85489	Of the three, he was more honourable than the two;
c85490	for he was their captain:
c85491	howbeit he attained not to the <i>first</i> three.
c85492	Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man of Kabzeel, who had done many acts;
c85493	he slew two lionlike men of Moab:
c85494	also he went down
c85495	and slew a lion in a pit in a snowy day.
c85496	And he slew an Egyptian, a man of <i>great</i> stature, five cubits
c85497	high; and in the Egyptian's hand <i>was</i> a spear like a weaver's beam;
c85498	and he went down to him with a staff,
c85499	and plucked the spear out of the Egyptian's hand,
c85500	and slew him with his own spear.
c85501	These <i>things</i> did Benaiah the son of Jehoiada,
c85502	and had the name among the three mighties.
c85503	among the thirty,
c85504	Behold,
c85505	he was honourable
c85506	but attained not to the <i>first</i> three:
c85507	and David set him over his guard.
c85508	Also the valiant men of the armies <i>were,</i> Asahel the brother of Joab, Elhanan the son of Dodo of Bethlehem,
c85509	Shammoth the Harorite, Helez the Pelonite,
c85510	Ira the son of Ikkesh the Tekoite, Abiezer the Antothite,
c85511	Sibbecai the Hushathite, Ilai the Ahohite,
c85512	Maharai the Netophathite, Heled the son of Baanah the Netophathite,
c85513	Ithai the son of Ribai of Gibeah, <i>that pertained</i> to the children of Benjamin, Benaiah the Pirathonite,
c85514	Hurai of the brooks of Gaash, Abiel the Arbathite,
c85515	Azmaveth the Baharumite, Eliahba the Shaalbonite,
c85516	The sons of Hashem the Gizonite, Jonathan the son of Shage the Hararite,
c85517	Ahiam the son of Sacar the Hararite, Eliphal the son of Ur,
c85518	Hepher the Mecherathite, Ahijah the Pelonite,
c85519	Hezro the Carmelite, Naarai the son of Ezbai,
c85520	Joel the brother of Nathan, Mibhar the son of Haggeri,
c85521	Zelek the Ammonite, Naharai the Berothite,
c85522	the armourbearer of Joab the son of Zeruiah,
c85523	Ira the Ithrite, Gareb the Ithrite,
c85524	Uriah the Hittite, Zabad the son of Ahlai,
c85525	Adina the son of Shiza the Reubenite, a captain of the Reubenites,
c85526	and thirty with him,
c85527	Hanan the son of Maachah, and Joshaphat the Mithnite,
c85528	Uzzia the Ashterathite, Shama and Jehiel the sons of Hothan the Aroerite,
c85529	Jediael the son of Shimri, and Joha his brother, the Tizite,
c85530	Eliel the Mahavite, and Jeribai, and Joshaviah, the sons of Elnaam, and Ithmah the Moabite,
c85531	Eliel, and Obed, and Jasiel the Mesobaite.
c85532	Now these
c85533	<i>are</i> they that came to David to Ziklag,
c85534	while he yet kept himself close because of Saul the son of Kish:
c85535	and they <i>were</i> among the mighty men, helpers of the war.
c85536	<i>They were</i> armed with bows,
c85537	and could use both the right hand and the left in <i>hurling</i> stones and <i>shooting</i> arrows out of a bow,
c85538	<i>even</i> of Saul's brethren of Benjamin.
c85539	The chief <i>was</i> Ahiezer,
c85540	then Joash, the sons of Shemaah the Gibeathite; and Jeziel, and Pelet, the sons of Azmaveth; and Berachah, and Jehu the Antothite,
c85541	And Ismaiah the Gibeonite,
c85542	a mighty man among the thirty, and over the thirty;
c85543	and Jeremiah, and Jahaziel, and Johanan, and Josabad the Gederathite,
c85544	Eluzai, and Jerimoth, and Bealiah, and Shemariah, and Shephatiah the Haruphite,
c85545	Elkanah, and Jesiah, and Azareel, and Joezer, and Jashobeam, the Korhites,
c85546	And Joelah, and Zebadiah, the sons of Jeroham of Gedor.
c85547	And of the Gadites there separated themselves unto David into the hold to the wilderness men of might, <i>and</i> men of war <i>fit</i> for the battle,
c85548	that could handle shield and buckler,
c85549	whose faces <i>were like</i> the faces of lions,
c85550	as the roes upon the mountains;
c85551	and <i>were</i> as swift
c85552	Ezer the first,
c85553	Obadiah the second,
c85554	Eliab the third,
c85555	Mishmannah the fourth,
c85556	Jeremiah the fifth,
c85557	Attai the sixth,
c85558	Eliel the seventh,
c85559	Johanan the eighth,
c85560	Elzabad the ninth,
c85561	Jeremiah the tenth,
c85562	Machbanai the eleventh.
c85563	These <i>were</i> of the sons of Gad, captains of the host:
c85564	one of the least <i>was</i> over an hundred,
c85565	and the greatest over a thousand.
c85566	These <i>are</i> they
c85567	that went over Jordan in the first month,
c85568	when it had overflown all his banks;
c85569	and they put to flight all <i>them</i> of the valleys, <i>both</i> toward the east, and toward the west.
c85570	And there came of the children of Benjamin and Judah to the hold unto David.
c85571	And David went out to meet
c85572	them, and answered
c85573	and said
c85574	unto them, If ye be come peaceably unto
c85575	me to help
c85576	me, mine heart shall be knit unto
c85577	you: but if <i>ye be come</i> to betray me to mine enemies,
c85578	seeing <i>there is</i> no wrong in mine hands,
c85579	the God of our fathers look
c85580	<i>thereon,</i> and rebuke <i>it.</i>
c85581	Then the spirit came upon Amasai, <i>who was</i> chief of the captains,
c85583	<i>and he said,</i> Thine <i>are we,</i> David,
c85584	and on thy side,
c85585	thou son of Jesse:
c85586	peace, peace
c85587	<i>be</i> unto thee, and peace <i>be</i> to thine helpers;
c85588	for thy God helpeth
c85589	thee. Then David received
c85590	them, and made them captains of the band.
c85591	And there fell <i>some</i> of Manasseh to David, when he came with the Philistines against
c85592	Saul to battle:
c85593	but they helped them not:
c85594	for the lords of the Philistines upon advisement sent him away,
c85595	saying,
c85596	He will fall to his master Saul to <i>the jeopardy of</i> our heads.
c85597	As he went to Ziklag,
c85598	there fell to him of Manasseh, Adnah, and Jozabad, and Jediael, and Michael, and Jozabad, and Elihu, and Zilthai, captains of the thousands
c85599	that <i>were</i> of Manasseh.
c85600	And they helped David against the band
c85601	<i>of the rovers:</i> for they <i>were</i> all mighty men of valour,
c85602	and were captains in the host.
c85603	For at <i>that</i> time day by day there came to David
c85604	to help
c85605	him, until <i>it was</i> a great host, like the host of God.
c85606	And these <i>are</i> the numbers of the bands <i>that were</i> ready armed to the war,
c85607	<i>and</i> came to David to Hebron,
c85608	to turn the kingdom of Saul to him, according to the word of the LORD.
c85609	The children of Judah
c85610	that bare shield and spear
c85611	<i>were</i> six thousand and eight hundred, ready armed to the war.
c85612	Of the children of Simeon, mighty men of valour for the war, seven thousand and one hundred.
c85613	Of the children of Levi four thousand and six hundred.
c85614	And Jehoiada <i>was</i> the leader of the Aaronites,
c85615	and with him <i>were</i> three thousand and seven hundred;
c85616	And Zadok, a young man mighty of valour,
c85617	and of his father's house twenty and two captains.
c85618	And of the children of Benjamin, the kindred of Saul, three thousand:
c85619	for hitherto the greatest part of them had kept the ward of the house of Saul.
c85620	And of the children of Ephraim twenty thousand and eight hundred, mighty men of valour, famous throughout the house of their fathers.
c85621	And of the half tribe of Manasseh eighteen thousand,
c85622	which were expressed by name,
c85623	to come
c85624	and make David king.
c85625	And of the children of Issachar,
c85626	<i>which were men</i> that had understanding of the times,
c85627	to know
c85628	what Israel ought to do;
c85629	the heads of them <i>were</i> two hundred;
c85630	and all their brethren <i>were</i> at their commandment.
c85631	Of Zebulun,
c85632	such as went forth to battle,
c85633	expert in war, with all instruments of war,
c85634	fifty thousand,
c85635	which could keep rank:
c85636	<i>they were</i> not of double heart.
c85637	And of Naphtali a thousand captains,
c85638	and with them with shield and spear thirty and seven thousand.
c85639	And of the Danites
c85640	expert in war
c85641	twenty and eight thousand and six hundred.
c85642	And of Asher,
c85643	such as went forth to battle,
c85644	expert in war,
c85645	forty thousand.
c85646	And on the other side of Jordan, of the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and of the half tribe of Manasseh, with all manner of instruments of war for the battle, an hundred and twenty thousand.
c85647	All these men of war,
c85648	that could keep rank,
c85649	came with a perfect heart to Hebron,
c85650	to make David king over all Israel:
c85651	and all the rest also of Israel <i>were</i> of one heart
c85652	to make David king.
c85653	And there they were with David three days,
c85654	eating
c85655	and drinking:
c85656	for their brethren had prepared for them.
c85657	Moreover
c85658	they that were nigh them, <i>even</i> unto Issachar and Zebulun and Naphtali, brought
c85659	bread on asses, and on camels, and on mules, and on oxen, <i>and</i> meat,
c85660	meal, cakes of figs, and bunches of raisins, and wine, and oil, and oxen, and sheep abundantly:
c85661	for <i>there was</i> joy in Israel.
c85662	And David consulted with the captains of thousands and hundreds, <i>and</i> with every leader.
c85663	And David said unto all the congregation of Israel,
c85664	If <i>it seem</i> good unto
c85665	you, and <i>that it be</i> of the LORD our God,
c85667	let us send abroad unto our brethren
c85668	every where, <i>that are</i> left in all the land of Israel,
c85669	and with them <i>also</i> to the priests and Levites <i>which are</i> in their cities <i>and</i> suburbs,
c85670	that they may gather themselves unto us:
c85671	And let us bring again the ark of our God to
c85672	us: for we enquired not at it in the days of Saul.
c85673	And all the congregation said
c85674	that they would do so:
c85675	for the thing was right in the eyes of all the people.
c85676	So David gathered all Israel together, from Shihor of Egypt
c85677	even unto the entering of Hemath,
c85678	to bring the ark of God from Kirjathjearim.
c85679	And David went up, and all Israel, to Baalah, <i>that is,</i> to Kirjathjearim,
c85680	which <i>belonged</i> to Judah,
c85681	to bring up thence the ark of God the LORD,
c85682	that dwelleth <i>between</i> the cherubims,
c85683	whose name is called <i>on it.</i>
c85684	And they carried the ark of God in a new cart out of the house of Abinadab:
c85685	and Uzza and Ahio drave the cart.
c85686	And David and all Israel played before God with all <i>their</i> might,
c85687	and with singing, and with harps, and with psalteries, and with timbrels, and with cymbals, and with trumpets.
c85688	And when they came unto the threshingfloor of Chidon,
c85689	Uzza put forth his hand
c85690	to hold the ark;
c85691	for the oxen stumbled.
c85692	And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Uzza,
c85693	and he smote
c85694	him, because  he put his hand to the ark:
c85695	and there he died before God.
c85696	And David was displeased,
c85697	because the LORD had made a breach upon Uzza:
c85698	wherefore that place is called Perezuzza to this day.
c85699	And David was afraid of God that day,
c85700	saying,
c85701	How shall I bring the ark of God <i>home</i> to me?
c85702	So David brought not the ark <i>home</i> to himself to the city of David,
c85703	but carried it aside into the house of Obededom the Gittite.
c85704	And the ark of God remained with the family of Obededom in his house three months.
c85705	And the LORD blessed the house of Obededom, and all
c85706	that he had.
c85707	Now Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David,
c85708	and timber of cedars, with masons and carpenters,
c85709	to build him an house.
c85710	And David perceived
c85711	that the LORD had confirmed him king over Israel,
c85712	for his kingdom was lifted up on high, because of his people Israel.
c85713	And David took more wives at Jerusalem:
c85714	and David begat more sons and daughters.
c85715	Now these <i>are</i> the names of <i>his</i> children
c85716	which he had in Jerusalem;
c85717	Shammua, and Shobab, Nathan, and Solomon,
c85718	And Ibhar, and Elishua, and Elpalet,
c85719	And Nogah, and Nepheg, and Japhia,
c85720	And Elishama, and Beeliada, and Eliphalet.
c85721	And when the Philistines heard
c85722	that David was anointed king over all Israel,
c85723	all the Philistines went up
c85724	to seek David.
c85725	And David heard
c85726	<i>of it,</i> and went out against them.
c85727	And the Philistines came
c85728	and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim.
c85729	And David enquired of God,
c85730	saying,
c85731	Shall I go up against the Philistines?
c85732	and wilt thou deliver them into mine hand?
c85733	And the LORD said
c85734	unto him, Go up;
c85735	for I will deliver them into thine hand.
c85736	So they came up to Baalperazim;
c85737	and David smote them there.
c85738	Then David said,
c85739	God hath broken in upon mine enemies by mine hand like the breaking forth of waters:
c85740	therefore they called the name of that place Baalperazim.
c85741	And when they had left their gods there,
c85742	David gave a commandment,
c85743	and they were burned with fire.
c85744	And the Philistines yet again
c85745	spread themselves abroad in the valley.
c85746	Therefore David enquired again of God;
c85747	and God said
c85748	unto him, Go not up after
c85749	them; turn away from
c85750	them, and come upon them over against the mulberry trees.
c85751	And it shall be,
c85752	when thou shalt hear a sound of going in the tops of the mulberry trees,
c85753	<i>that</i> then thou shalt go out to battle:
c85754	for God is gone forth before
c85755	thee to smite the host of the Philistines.
c85756	David therefore did
c85757	as God commanded
c85758	him: and they smote the host of the Philistines from Gibeon even to Gazer.
c85759	And the fame of David went out into all lands;
c85760	and the LORD brought the fear of him upon all nations.
c85761	And <i>David</i> made him houses in the city of David,
c85762	and prepared a place for the ark of God,
c85763	and pitched for it a tent.
c85764	Then David said,
c85765	None ought to carry the ark of God
c85766	but the Levites:
c85767	for them hath the LORD chosen
c85768	to carry the ark of God,
c85769	and to minister unto him for ever.
c85770	And David gathered all Israel together to Jerusalem,
c85771	to bring up the ark of the LORD unto his place,
c85772	which he had prepared for it.
c85773	And David assembled the children of Aaron, and the Levites:
c85774	Of the sons of Kohath; Uriel the chief,
c85775	and his brethren an hundred and twenty:
c85776	Of the sons of Merari; Asaiah the chief,
c85777	and his brethren two hundred and twenty:
c85778	Of the sons of Gershom; Joel the chief,
c85779	and his brethren an hundred and thirty:
c85780	Of the sons of Elizaphan; Shemaiah the chief,
c85781	and his brethren two hundred:
c85782	Of the sons of Hebron; Eliel the chief,
c85783	and his brethren fourscore:
c85784	Of the sons of Uzziel; Amminadab the chief,
c85785	and his brethren an hundred and twelve.
c85786	And David called for Zadok and Abiathar the priests, and for the Levites, for Uriel, Asaiah, and Joel, Shemaiah, and Eliel, and Amminadab,
c85787	And said
c85788	unto them, Ye <i>are</i> the chief of the fathers of the Levites:
c85789	sanctify yourselves, <i>both</i> ye and your brethren,
c85790	that ye may bring up the ark of the LORD God of Israel
c85791	unto <i>the place that</i> I have prepared for it.
c85792	For because ye <i>did it</i> not at the first,
c85793	the LORD our God made a breach
c85794	upon us, for that we sought him not after the due order.
c85795	So the priests and the Levites sanctified themselves
c85796	to bring up the ark of the LORD God of Israel.
c85797	And the children of the Levites bare the ark of God
c85798	as Moses commanded according to the word of the LORD.
c85799	upon their shoulders with the staves thereon,
c85800	And David spake to the chief of the Levites
c85801	to appoint their brethren
c85802	<i>to be</i> the singers with instruments of musick, psalteries and harps and cymbals,
c85803	sounding,
c85804	by lifting up the voice with joy.
c85805	So the Levites appointed Heman the son of Joel;
c85806	and of his brethren, Asaph the son of Berechiah;
c85807	and of the sons of Merari their brethren, Ethan the son of Kushaiah;
c85808	And with them their brethren of the second <i>degree,</i> Zechariah, Ben, and Jaaziel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Unni, Eliab, and Benaiah, and Maaseiah, and Mattithiah, and Elipheleh, and Mikneiah, and Obededom, and Jeiel, the porters.
c85809	So the singers, Heman, Asaph, and Ethan, <i>were appointed</i> to sound with cymbals of brass;
c85811	And Zechariah, and Aziel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Unni, and Eliab, and Maaseiah, and Benaiah, with psalteries on Alamoth;
c85812	And Mattithiah, and Elipheleh, and Mikneiah, and Obededom, and Jeiel, and Azaziah, with harps on the Sheminith
c85813	to excel.
c85814	And Chenaniah, chief of the Levites, <i>was</i> for song:
c85815	he instructed about the song,
c85816	because he <i>was</i> skilful.
c85817	And Berechiah and Elkanah <i>were</i> doorkeepers for the ark.
c85818	And Shebaniah, and Jehoshaphat, and Nethaneel, and Amasai, and Zechariah, and Benaiah, and Eliezer, the priests, did blow with the trumpets before the ark of God:
c85819	and Obededom and Jehiah <i>were</i> doorkeepers for the ark.
c85820	So
c85821	David, and the elders of Israel, and the captains over thousands,
c85822	went
c85823	to bring up the ark of the covenant of the LORD out of the house of Obededom with joy.
c85824	And it came to pass,
c85825	when God helped the Levites
c85826	that bare the ark of the covenant of the LORD,
c85827	that they offered seven bullocks and seven rams.
c85828	And David <i>was</i> clothed with a robe of fine linen,
c85829	and all the Levites
c85830	that bare the ark,
c85831	and the singers, and Chenaniah the master of the song with the singers:
c85832	David also <i>had</i> upon him an ephod of linen.
c85833	Thus all Israel brought up the ark of the covenant of the LORD with shouting, and with sound of the cornet, and with trumpets, and with cymbals,
c85834	making a noise with psalteries and harps.
c85835	And it came to pass,
c85836	<i>as</i> the ark of the covenant of the LORD came to the city of David,
c85837	that Michal the daughter of Saul looking out at a window
c85838	saw king David
c85839	dancing
c85840	and playing:
c85841	and she despised him in her heart.
c85842	So they brought the ark of God,
c85843	and set it in the midst of the tent
c85844	that David had pitched
c85845	for it: and they offered burnt sacrifices and peace offerings before God.
c85846	And when David had made an end
c85847	of offering the burnt offerings and the peace offerings,
c85848	he blessed the people in the name of the LORD.
c85849	And he dealt to every one of Israel, both man and woman,
c85850	to every one a loaf of bread, and a good piece of flesh, and a flagon <i>of wine.</i>
c85851	And he appointed <i>certain</i> of the Levites to minister before the ark of the LORD,
c85852	and to record,
c85853	and to thank
c85854	and praise the LORD God of Israel:
c85855	Asaph the chief,
c85856	and next to him Zechariah,
c85857	Jeiel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Mattithiah, and Eliab, and Benaiah, and Obededom: and Jeiel with psalteries and with harps;
c85858	but Asaph made a sound with cymbals;
c85859	Benaiah also and Jahaziel the priests with trumpets continually before the ark of the covenant of God.
c85860	Then on that day David delivered first
c85861	<i>this psalm</i> to thank the LORD into the hand of Asaph and his brethren.
c85862	Give thanks unto the LORD,
c85863	call upon his name,
c85864	make known his deeds among the people.
c85865	Sing
c85866	unto him, sing psalms
c85867	unto him, talk ye of all his wondrous works.
c85868	Glory ye in his holy name:
c85869	let the heart of them rejoice
c85870	that seek the LORD.
c85871	Seek the LORD and his strength,
c85872	seek his face continually.
c85873	Remember his marvellous works
c85874	that he hath done,
c85875	his wonders, and the judgments of his mouth;
c85876	O ye seed of Israel his servant,
c85877	ye children of Jacob, his chosen ones.
c85878	He <i>is</i> the LORD our God;
c85879	his judgments <i>are</i> in all the earth.
c85880	Be ye mindful always of his covenant;
c85881	the word
c85882	<i>which</i> he commanded to a thousand generations;
c85883	<i>Even of the covenant</i> which he made with Abraham,
c85884	and of his oath unto Isaac;
c85885	And hath confirmed the same to Jacob for a law,
c85886	<i>and</i> to Israel <i>for</i> an everlasting covenant,
c85887	Saying,
c85888	Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan, the lot of your inheritance;
c85889	When ye were but few, even a few,
c85890	and strangers in it.
c85891	And <i>when</i> they went from nation to nation,
c85892	and from <i>one</i> kingdom to another people;
c85893	He suffered no man
c85894	to do them wrong:
c85895	yea, he reproved kings for their sakes,
c85896	<i>Saying,</i> Touch not mine anointed,
c85897	and do my prophets no harm.
c85898	Sing unto the LORD,
c85899	all the earth;
c85900	shew forth from day to day his salvation.
c85901	Declare his glory among the heathen;
c85902	his marvellous works among all nations.
c85903	For great <i>is</i> the LORD,
c85904	and greatly to be praised:
c85905	he also <i>is</i> to be feared above all gods.
c85906	For all the gods of the people <i>are</i> idols:
c85907	but the LORD made the heavens.
c85908	Glory and honour <i>are</i> in his presence;
c85909	strength and gladness <i>are</i> in his place.
c85910	Give unto the LORD,
c85911	ye kindreds of the people,
c85912	give unto the LORD glory and strength.
c85913	Give unto the LORD the glory <i>due</i> unto his name:
c85914	bring an offering,
c85915	and come before
c85916	him: worship the LORD in the beauty of holiness.
c85917	Fear before
c85918	him, all the earth:
c85919	the world also shall be stable,
c85920	that it be not moved.
c85921	Let the heavens be glad,
c85922	and let the earth rejoice:
c85923	and let <i>men</i> say among the nations,
c85924	The LORD reigneth.
c85925	Let the sea roar, and the fulness
c85926	thereof: let the fields rejoice, and all
c85927	that <i>is</i> therein.
c85928	Then shall the trees of the wood sing out at the presence of the LORD,
c85929	because he cometh
c85930	to judge the earth.
c85931	O give thanks unto the LORD;
c85932	for <i>he is</i> good;
c85933	for his mercy <i>endureth</i> for ever.
c85934	And say
c85935	ye, Save
c85936	us, O God of our salvation,
c85937	and gather us together,
c85938	and deliver us from the heathen,
c85939	that we may give thanks to thy holy name,
c85940	<i>and</i> glory in thy praise.
c85941	Blessed <i>be</i> the LORD God of Israel for ever and ever.
c85942	And all the people said,
c85943	Amen,
c85944	and praised the LORD.
c85945	So he left there before the ark of the covenant of the LORD Asaph and his brethren,
c85946	to minister before the ark continually, as every day's work required:
c85947	And Obededom with their brethren, threescore and eight;
c85948	Obededom also the son of Jeduthun and Hosah <i>to be</i> porters:
c85949	And Zadok the priest, and his brethren the priests, before the tabernacle of the LORD in the high place
c85950	that <i>was</i> at Gibeon,
c85951	To offer burnt offerings unto the LORD upon the altar of the burnt offering continually morning and evening,
c85952	and <i>to do</i> according to all
c85953	that is written in the law of the LORD,
c85954	which he commanded Israel;
c85955	And with them Heman and Jeduthun, and the rest
c85956	that were chosen,
c85957	who were expressed by name,
c85958	to give thanks to the LORD,
c85959	because his mercy <i>endureth</i> for ever;
c85960	And with them Heman and Jeduthun
c85961	with trumpets and cymbals for those that should make a sound,
c85962	and with musical instruments of God.
c85963	And the sons of Jeduthun <i>were</i> porters.
c85964	And all the people departed
c85965	every man to his house:
c85966	and David returned
c85967	to bless his house.
c85968	Now it came to pass,
c85969	as David sat in his house,
c85970	that David said to Nathan the prophet,
c85971	Lo, I dwell in an house of cedars,
c85972	but the ark of the covenant of the LORD <i>remaineth</i> under curtains.
c85973	Then Nathan said unto David,
c85974	all
c85975	that <i>is</i> in thine heart;
c85976	Do
c85977	for God <i>is</i> with thee.
c85978	And it came to pass the same night,
c85979	that the word of God came to Nathan,
c85980	saying,
c85981	Go
c85982	and tell David my servant,
c85983	Thus saith the LORD,
c85984	Thou shalt not build me an house
c85985	to dwell in:
c85986	For I have not dwelt in an house since the day
c85987	that I brought up Israel
c85988	unto this day;
c85989	but have gone from tent to tent, and from <i>one</i> tabernacle <i>to another.</i>
c85990	Wheresoever
c85991	I have walked with all Israel,
c85992	spake I a word to any of the judges of Israel,
c85993	whom I commanded
c85994	to feed my people,
c85995	saying,
c85996	Why have ye not built me an house of cedars?
c85997	Now
c85998	therefore thus shalt thou say unto my servant David,
c85999	Thus saith the LORD of hosts,
c86000	I took thee from the sheepcote, <i>even</i> from following the sheep,
c86001	that thou shouldest be ruler over my people Israel:
c86002	And I have been with thee whithersoever
c86003	thou hast walked,
c86004	and have cut off all thine enemies from before
c86005	thee, and have made thee a name like the name of the great men
c86006	that <i>are</i> in the earth.
c86007	Also I will ordain a place for my people Israel,
c86008	and will plant
c86009	them, and they shall dwell in their place,
c86010	and shall be moved no more;
c86011	neither shall the children of wickedness waste them any more,
c86013	as at the beginning,
c86014	And since the time
c86015	that I commanded judges <i>to be</i> over my people Israel.
c86016	Moreover I will subdue all thine enemies.
c86017	Furthermore I tell
c86018	thee that the LORD will build thee an house.
c86019	And it shall come to pass,
c86020	when thy days be expired
c86021	that thou must go <i>to be</i> with thy fathers,
c86022	that I will raise up thy seed after
c86023	thee, which shall be of thy sons;
c86024	and I will establish his kingdom.
c86025	He shall build me an house,
c86026	and I will stablish his throne for ever.
c86027	I will be his father,
c86028	and he shall be my son:
c86029	and I will not take my mercy away from
c86030	him, as I took
c86031	<i>it</i> from <i>him</i> that was before thee:
c86032	But I will settle him in mine house and in my kingdom for ever:
c86033	and his throne shall be established for evermore.
c86034	According to all these words, and according to all this vision,
c86035	so did Nathan speak unto David.
c86036	And David the king came
c86037	and sat before the LORD,
c86038	and said,
c86039	Who <i>am</i> I,
c86040	O LORD God,
c86041	and what <i>is</i> mine house,
c86042	that thou hast brought me hitherto?
c86043	And <i>yet</i> this was a small thing in thine eyes,
c86044	O God;
c86045	for thou hast <i>also</i> spoken of thy servant's house for a great while to come,
c86046	and hast regarded me according to the estate of a man of high degree,
c86047	O LORD God.
c86048	What can David <i>speak</i> more to thee for the honour of thy servant?
c86049	for thou knowest thy servant.
c86050	O LORD,
c86051	for thy servant's sake, and according to thine own heart, hast thou done all this greatness,
c86052	in making known all <i>these</i> great things.
c86053	O LORD,
c86054	<i>there is</i> none like thee,
c86055	neither <i>is there any</i> God beside thee, according to all
c86056	that we have heard with our ears.
c86057	And what one nation in the earth <i>is</i> like thy people Israel,
c86058	whom God went
c86059	to redeem <i>to be</i> his own people,
c86060	to make thee a name of greatness and terribleness,
c86061	by driving out nations from before thy people,
c86062	whom thou hast redeemed out of Egypt?
c86064	For thy people Israel didst thou make thine own people for ever;
c86065	and thou,
c86066	LORD,
c86067	becamest their God.
c86068	Therefore now,
c86069	LORD,
c86070	let the thing
c86071	that thou hast spoken concerning thy servant and concerning his house
c86072	be established for ever,
c86073	and do
c86074	as thou hast said.
c86075	Let it even be established,
c86076	that thy name may be magnified for ever,
c86077	saying,
c86078	The LORD of hosts <i>is</i> the God of Israel, <i>even</i> a God to Israel:
c86079	and <i>let</i> the house of David thy servant <i>be</i> established before thee.
c86080	For thou,
c86081	O my God,
c86082	hast told thy servant
c86083	that thou wilt build him an house:
c86084	therefore thy servant hath found
c86085	<i>in his heart</i> to pray before thee.
c86086	And now,
c86087	LORD,
c86088	thou art God,
c86089	and hast promised this goodness unto thy servant:
c86090	Now
c86091	therefore let it please
c86092	thee to bless the house of thy servant,
c86093	that it may be before thee for ever:
c86094	for thou
c86095	O LORD,
c86096	blessest,
c86097	and <i>it shall be</i> blessed for ever.
c86098	Now after this it came to pass,
c86099	that David smote the Philistines,
c86100	and subdued
c86101	them, and took Gath and her towns out of the hand of the Philistines.
c86102	And he smote Moab;
c86103	and the Moabites became David's servants,
c86104	<i>and</i> brought gifts.
c86105	And David smote Hadarezer king of Zobah unto Hamath,
c86106	as he went
c86107	to stablish his dominion by the river Euphrates.
c86108	And David took from him a thousand chariots, and seven thousand horsemen, and twenty thousand footmen:
c86109	David also houghed all the chariot
c86110	<i>horses,</i> but reserved of them an hundred chariots.
c86111	And when the Syrians of Damascus came
c86112	to help Hadarezer king of Zobah,
c86113	David slew of the Syrians two and twenty thousand men.
c86114	Then David put <i>garrisons</i> in Syriadamascus;
c86115	and the Syrians became David's servants,
c86116	<i>and</i> brought gifts.
c86117	Thus the LORD preserved David whithersoever
c86118	he went.
c86119	And David took the shields of gold
c86120	that were on the servants of Hadarezer,
c86121	and brought them to Jerusalem.
c86122	Likewise from Tibhath, and from Chun, cities of Hadarezer, brought David very much brass,
c86123	wherewith Solomon made the brasen sea, and the pillars, and the vessels of brass.
c86124	Now when Tou king of Hamath heard
c86125	how David had smitten all the host of Hadarezer king of Zobah;
c86126	He sent Hadoram his son to king David,
c86127	to enquire of his welfare,
c86128	and to congratulate
c86129	him, because he had fought against Hadarezer,
c86130	and smitten
c86131	him; (for Hadarezer had war with Tou;)
c86132	and <i>with him</i> all manner of vessels of gold and silver and brass.
c86133	Them also king David dedicated unto the LORD, with the silver and the gold
c86134	that he brought from all <i>these</i> nations; from Edom, and from Moab, and from the children of Ammon, and from the Philistines, and from Amalek.
c86135	Moreover Abishai the son of Zeruiah slew of the Edomites in the valley of salt eighteen thousand.
c86136	And he put garrisons in Edom;
c86137	and all the Edomites became David's servants.
c86138	Thus the LORD preserved David whithersoever
c86139	he went.
c86140	So David reigned over all Israel,
c86141	and executed judgment and justice among all his people.
c86142	And Joab the son of Zeruiah <i>was</i> over the host;
c86143	and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud, recorder.
c86144	And Zadok the son of Ahitub, and Abimelech the son of Abiathar, <i>were</i> the priests;
c86145	and Shavsha was scribe;
c86146	And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada <i>was</i> over the Cherethites and the Pelethites;
c86147	and the sons of David <i>were</i> chief about the king.
c86148	Now it came to pass after this,
c86149	that Nahash the king of the children of Ammon died,
c86150	and his son reigned in his stead.
c86151	And David said,
c86152	I will shew kindness unto Hanun the son of Nahash,
c86153	because his father shewed kindness to
c86154	me. And David sent messengers
c86155	to comfort him concerning his father.
c86156	So the servants of David came into the land of the children of Ammon to Hanun,
c86157	to comfort him.
c86158	But the princes of the children of Ammon said to Hanun,
c86159	Thinkest thou that David doth honour thy father,
c86160	that he hath sent comforters
c86161	unto thee? are not
c86162	thee for to search,
c86163	and to overthrow,
c86164	and to spy out the land?
c86165	his servants come unto
c86166	Wherefore Hanun took David's servants,
c86167	and shaved
c86168	them, and cut off their garments in the midst hard by their buttocks,
c86169	and sent them away.
c86170	Then there went
c86171	<i>certain,</i> and told David how the men
c86172	were served. And he sent
c86173	to meet
c86174	them: for the men were greatly ashamed.
c86175	And the king said,
c86176	Tarry at Jericho
c86177	until your beards be grown,
c86178	and <i>then</i> return.
c86179	And when the children of Ammon saw
c86180	that they had made themselves odious to David,
c86181	Hanun and the children of Ammon sent a thousand talents of silver
c86182	to hire them chariots and horsemen out of Mesopotamia, and out of Syriamaachah, and out of Zobah.
c86183	So they hired thirty and two thousand chariots, and the king of Maachah and his people;
c86184	who came
c86185	and pitched before Medeba.
c86186	And the children of Ammon gathered themselves together from their cities,
c86187	and came to battle.
c86188	And when David heard
c86189	<i>of it,</i> he sent Joab, and all the host of the mighty men.
c86190	And the children of Ammon came out,
c86191	and put the battle in array before the gate of the city:
c86192	and the kings
c86193	that were come
c86194	<i>were</i> by themselves in the field.
c86195	Now when Joab saw
c86196	that the battle was set against him before and behind,
c86197	he chose out of all the choice of Israel,
c86198	and put <i>them</i> in array
c86199	against the Syrians.
c86200	And the rest of the people he delivered unto the hand of Abishai his brother,
c86201	and they set <i>themselves</i> in array
c86202	against the children of Ammon.
c86203	And he said,
c86204	If the Syrians be too strong for
c86205	me, then thou shalt help
c86206	me: but if the children of Ammon be too strong for
c86207	thee, then I will help thee.
c86208	Be of good courage,
c86209	and let us behave ourselves valiantly for our people, and for the cities of our God:
c86210	and let the LORD
c86211	<i>that which is</i> good in his sight.
c86212	do
c86213	So Joab and the people that <i>were</i> with him drew nigh
c86215	before the Syrians unto the battle;
c86216	and they fled before him.
c86217	And when the children of Ammon saw
c86218	that the Syrians were fled,
c86219	they likewise fled before Abishai his brother,
c86220	and entered into the city.
c86221	Then Joab came to Jerusalem.
c86222	And when the Syrians saw
c86223	that they were put to the worse before Israel,
c86224	they sent messengers,
c86225	and drew forth the Syrians
c86226	that <i>were</i> beyond the river:
c86227	and Shophach the captain of the host of Hadarezer <i>went</i> before them.
c86228	And it was told David;
c86229	and he gathered all Israel,
c86230	and passed over Jordan,
c86231	and came upon
c86232	them, and set <i>the battle</i> in array against
c86233	them. So when David had put the battle in array
c86234	against the Syrians,
c86236	they fought with him.
c86237	But the Syrians fled before Israel;
c86238	and David slew of the Syrians seven thousand <i>men which fought in</i> chariots, and forty thousand footmen,
c86239	and killed Shophach the captain of the host.
c86240	And when the servants of Hadarezer saw
c86241	that they were put to the worse before Israel,
c86242	they made peace with David,
c86243	and became his servants:
c86244	neither would the Syrians
c86245	help the children of Ammon any more.
c86246	And it came to pass, that after the year was expired, at the time
c86247	that kings go out
c86248	<i>to battle,</i> Joab led forth the power of the army,
c86249	and wasted the country of the children of Ammon,
c86250	and came
c86251	and besieged Rabbah.
c86252	But David tarried at Jerusalem.
c86253	And Joab smote Rabbah,
c86254	and destroyed it.
c86255	And David took the crown of their king from off his head,
c86256	and found it to weigh a talent of gold,
c86257	and <i>there were</i> precious stones
c86258	in it; and it was set upon David's head:
c86259	and he brought also exceeding much spoil out of the city.
c86260	the people
c86261	that
c86262	And he brought out
c86263	<i>were</i> in it, and cut <i>them</i> with saws, and with harrows of iron, and with axes.
c86264	Even so dealt David with all the cities of the children of Ammon.
c86265	And David and all the people returned to Jerusalem.
c86266	And it came to pass after this,
c86267	that there arose war at Gezer with the Philistines;
c86268	at which time Sibbechai the Hushathite slew Sippai, <i>that was</i> of the children of the giant:
c86269	and they were subdued.
c86270	And there was war again with the Philistines;
c86271	and Elhanan the son of Jair slew Lahmi the brother of Goliath the Gittite,
c86272	whose spear staff <i>was</i> like a weaver's beam.
c86273	And yet again there was war at Gath,
c86274	where was a man of <i>great</i> stature,
c86275	whose fingers and toes <i>were</i> four and twenty, six <i>on each hand,</i> and six
c86277	<i>on each foot:</i> and he also was the son of the giant.
c86278	But when he defied Israel,
c86279	Jonathan the son of Shimea David's brother slew him.
c86280	These were born unto the giant in Gath;
c86281	and they fell by the hand of David, and by the hand of his servants.
c86282	And Satan stood up against Israel,
c86283	and provoked David
c86284	to number Israel.
c86285	And David said to Joab and to the rulers of the people,
c86286	Go,
c86287	number Israel from Beersheba even to Dan;
c86288	and bring the number of them to
c86289	me, that I may know <i>it.</i>
c86290	And Joab answered,
c86291	The LORD make his people an hundred times so many more as they
c86292	<i>are</i> they not
c86293	<i>be:</i> but, my lord the king,
c86294	all my lord's servants?
c86295	why then doth my lord require this thing?
c86296	why will he be a cause of trespass to Israel?
c86297	Nevertheless the king's word prevailed against Joab.
c86298	Wherefore Joab departed,
c86299	and went throughout all Israel,
c86300	and came to Jerusalem.
c86301	And Joab gave the sum of the number of the people unto David.
c86302	And all <i>they of</i> Israel were a thousand thousand and an hundred thousand men
c86303	that drew sword:
c86304	and Judah <i>was</i> four hundred threescore and ten thousand men
c86305	that drew sword.
c86306	But Levi and Benjamin counted he not among
c86307	them: for the king's word was abominable to Joab.
c86308	And God was displeased with this thing;
c86309	therefore he smote Israel.
c86310	And David said unto God,
c86311	I have sinned greatly,
c86312	because I have done this thing:
c86313	but now,
c86314	I beseech thee, do away the iniquity of thy servant;
c86315	for I have done very foolishly.
c86316	And the LORD spake unto Gad, David's seer,
c86317	saying,
c86318	Go
c86319	and tell David,
c86320	saying,
c86321	Thus saith the LORD,
c86322	I offer thee three
c86323	<i>things:</i> choose thee one of them,
c86324	that I may do <i>it</i> unto thee.
c86325	So Gad came to David,
c86326	and said
c86327	unto him, Thus saith the LORD,
c86328	Choose thee
c86329	Either three years' famine;
c86330	or three months to be destroyed before thy foes,
c86331	while that the sword of thine enemies overtaketh
c86332	<i>thee;</i> or else three days the sword of the LORD,
c86333	even the pestilence, in the land,
c86334	and the angel of the LORD destroying throughout all the coasts of Israel.
c86335	Now
c86336	therefore advise
c86337	thyself what word I shall bring again to him that sent me.
c86338	And David said unto Gad,
c86339	I am in a great strait:
c86340	let me fall now into the hand of the LORD;
c86341	for very great <i>are</i> his mercies:
c86342	but let me not fall into the hand of man.
c86343	So the LORD sent pestilence upon Israel:
c86344	and there fell of Israel seventy thousand men.
c86345	And God sent an angel unto Jerusalem
c86346	to destroy
c86348	it: and as he was destroying,
c86349	the LORD beheld,
c86350	and he repented him of the evil,
c86351	and said to the angel that destroyed,
c86352	It is enough, stay now
c86353	thine hand.
c86354	And the angel of the LORD stood by the threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite.
c86355	And David lifted up his eyes,
c86356	and saw the angel of the LORD
c86357	stand between the earth and the heaven,
c86358	having a drawn sword in his hand
c86359	stretched out over Jerusalem.
c86360	Then David and the elders <i>of Israel, who were</i> clothed in sackcloth, fell
c86362	upon their faces.
c86363	And David said unto God,
c86364	<i>Is it</i> not I <i>that</i> commanded
c86365	the people to be numbered?
c86366	even I it
c86367	is that have sinned
c86368	and done evil indeed;
c86369	but <i>as for</i> these sheep,
c86370	what have they done?
c86372	let thine hand, I pray thee, O LORD my God, be on me, and on my father's house;
c86373	but not on thy people, that they should be plagued.
c86374	Then the angel of the LORD commanded Gad
c86375	to say to David,
c86376	that David should go up,
c86377	and set up an altar unto the LORD in the threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite.
c86378	And David went up at the saying of Gad,
c86379	which he spake in the name of the LORD.
c86380	And Ornan turned back,
c86381	and saw the angel;
c86382	and his four sons with him hid themselves.
c86383	Now Ornan was threshing wheat.
c86384	And as David came to Ornan,
c86385	Ornan looked
c86386	and saw David,
c86387	and went out of the threshingfloor,
c86388	and bowed himself to David
c86389	with <i>his</i> face to the ground.
c86390	Then David said to Ornan,
c86391	Grant me the place of <i>this</i> threshingfloor,
c86392	that I may build an altar therein unto the LORD:
c86393	thou shalt grant it me for the full price:
c86394	that the plague may be stayed from the people.
c86395	And Ornan said unto David,
c86396	Take
c86397	<i>it</i> to thee, and let my lord the king do
c86398	<i>that which is</i> good in his eyes:
c86399	lo,
c86400	I give <i>thee</i> the oxen <i>also</i> for burnt offerings,
c86401	and the threshing instruments for wood,
c86402	and the wheat for the meat offering;
c86403	I give it all.
c86404	And king David said to Ornan,
c86405	Nay;
c86406	but I will verily buy it for the full price:
c86407	for I will not take
c86408	<i>that</i> which
c86409	<i>is</i> thine for the LORD,
c86410	nor offer burnt offerings without cost.
c86411	So David gave to Ornan for the place six hundred shekels of gold by weight.
c86412	And David built there an altar unto the LORD,
c86413	and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings,
c86414	and called upon the LORD;
c86415	and he answered him from heaven by fire upon the altar of burnt offering.
c86416	And the LORD commanded the angel;
c86417	and he put up his sword again into the sheath thereof.
c86418	At that time
c86419	when David saw
c86420	that the LORD had answered him in the threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite,
c86421	then he sacrificed there.
c86422	For the tabernacle of the LORD,
c86423	which Moses made in the wilderness,
c86424	and the altar of the burnt offering, <i>were</i> at that season in the high place at Gibeon.
c86425	But David could not
c86426	go before
c86427	it to enquire of God:
c86428	for he was afraid because of the sword of the angel of the LORD.
c86429	Then David said,
c86430	This
c86431	<i>is</i> the house of the LORD God,
c86432	and this <i>is</i> the altar of the burnt offering for Israel.
c86433	And David commanded
c86434	to gather together the strangers
c86435	that <i>were</i> in the land of Israel;
c86436	and he set masons
c86437	to hew wrought stones
c86438	to build the house of God.
c86439	And David prepared iron in abundance for the nails for the doors of the gates, and for the joinings;
c86440	and brass in abundance
c86441	without weight;
c86442	Also cedar trees in abundance:
c86443	for the Zidonians and they of Tyre brought much cedar wood to David.
c86444	And David said,
c86445	Solomon my son <i>is</i> young and tender,
c86446	and the house
c86447	<i>that is</i> to be builded for the LORD
c86448	<i>must be</i> exceeding magnifical, of fame and of glory throughout all countries:
c86449	I will <i>therefore</i> now make preparation
c86450	for it. So David prepared abundantly before his death.
c86451	Then he called for Solomon his son,
c86452	and charged
c86453	him to build an house for the LORD God of Israel.
c86454	And David said to Solomon,
c86455	My son,
c86456	as for me,
c86457	it was in my mind
c86458	to build an house unto the name of the LORD my God:
c86459	But the word of the LORD came to
c86460	me, saying,
c86461	Thou hast shed blood abundantly,
c86462	and hast made great wars:
c86463	thou shalt not build an house unto my name,
c86464	because thou hast shed much blood upon the earth in my sight.
c86465	Behold, a son shall be born
c86466	to thee, who shall be a man of rest;
c86467	and I will give him rest from all his enemies round about:
c86468	for his name shall be Solomon,
c86469	and I will give peace and quietness unto Israel in his days.
c86470	He shall build an house for my name;
c86471	and he shall be my son,
c86472	and I <i>will be</i> his father;
c86473	and I will establish the throne of his kingdom over Israel for ever.
c86474	Now,
c86475	my son,
c86476	the LORD be with
c86477	thee; and prosper
c86478	thou, and build the house of the LORD thy God,
c86479	as he hath said of thee.
c86480	Only the LORD give thee wisdom and understanding,
c86481	and give thee charge concerning Israel,
c86482	that thou mayest keep the law of the LORD thy God.
c86483	Then shalt thou prosper,
c86484	if thou takest heed
c86485	to fulfil the statutes and judgments
c86486	which the LORD charged Moses with concerning Israel:
c86487	be strong,
c86488	and of good courage;
c86489	dread not,
c86490	nor be dismayed.
c86491	Now, behold,
c86492	in my trouble I have prepared for the house of the LORD an hundred thousand talents of gold, and a thousand thousand talents of silver;
c86493	and of brass and iron without weight;
c86494	for it is in abundance:
c86495	timber also and stone have I prepared;
c86496	and thou mayest add thereto.
c86497	Moreover <i>there are</i> workmen with thee in abundance, hewers and workers of stone and timber, and all manner of cunning men for every manner of work.
c86498	Of the gold, the silver, and the brass, and the iron, <i>there is</i> no number.
c86499	Arise
c86500	<i>therefore,</i> and be doing,
c86501	and the LORD be with thee.
c86502	David also commanded all the princes of Israel
c86503	to help Solomon his son, <i>saying,</i>
c86504	<i>Is</i> not the LORD your God with
c86505	you? and hath he <i>not</i> given you rest on every side?
c86506	for he hath given the inhabitants of the land into mine hand;
c86507	and the land is subdued before the LORD, and before his people.
c86508	Now set your heart and your soul
c86509	to seek the LORD your God;
c86510	arise
c86511	therefore, and build ye the sanctuary of the LORD God,
c86512	to bring the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and the holy vessels of God, into the house
c86513	that is to be built to the name of the LORD.
c86514	So when David was old
c86515	and full of days,
c86516	he made Solomon his son king over Israel.
c86517	And he gathered together all the princes of Israel, with the priests and the Levites.
c86518	Now the Levites were numbered from the age of thirty years and upward:
c86519	and their number by their polls, man by man, was thirty and eight thousand.
c86520	Of which,
c86521	<i>were</i> to set forward the work of the house of the LORD;
c86522	twenty and four thousand
c86523	and six thousand <i>were</i> officers and judges:
c86524	Moreover four thousand <i>were</i> porters;
c86525	and four thousand praised the LORD with the instruments
c86526	which I made,
c86527	<i>said David,</i> to praise <i>therewith.</i>
c86528	And David divided them into courses
c86529	among the sons of Levi, <i>namely,</i> Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.
c86530	Of the Gershonites <i>were,</i> Laadan, and Shimei.
c86531	The sons of Laadan;
c86532	the chief <i>was</i> Jehiel,
c86533	and Zetham, and Joel,
c86534	three.
c86535	The sons of Shimei; Shelomith, and Haziel, and Haran, three.
c86536	These <i>were</i> the chief of the fathers of Laadan.
c86537	And the sons of Shimei <i>were,</i> Jahath, Zina, and Jeush, and Beriah.
c86538	These four <i>were</i> the sons of Shimei.
c86539	And Jahath was the chief,
c86540	and Zizah the second:
c86541	but Jeush and Beriah had not many sons;
c86542	therefore they were in one reckoning, according to <i>their</i> father's house.
c86543	The sons of Kohath; Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel, four.
c86544	The sons of Amram; Aaron and Moses:
c86545	and Aaron was separated,
c86546	that he should sanctify the most holy things,
c86547	he and his sons
c86548	for ever,
c86549	to burn incense before the LORD,
c86550	to minister
c86551	unto him, and to bless in his name for ever.
c86552	Now <i>concerning</i> Moses the man of God,
c86553	his sons were named of the tribe of Levi.
c86554	The sons of Moses <i>were,</i> Gershom, and Eliezer.
c86555	Of the sons of Gershom,
c86556	Shebuel <i>was</i> the chief.
c86557	And the sons of Eliezer <i>were,</i> Rehabiah the chief.
c86559	And Eliezer had none other sons;
c86560	but the sons of Rehabiah were very many.
c86561	Of the sons of Izhar;
c86562	Shelomith the chief.
c86563	Of the sons of Hebron;
c86564	Jeriah the first,
c86565	Amariah the second,
c86566	Jahaziel the third,
c86567	and Jekameam the fourth.
c86568	Of the sons of Uzziel;
c86569	Michah the first,
c86570	and Jesiah the second.
c86571	The sons of Merari; Mahli, and Mushi.
c86572	The sons of Mahli; Eleazar, and Kish.
c86573	And Eleazar died,
c86574	and had no sons,
c86575	but daughters:
c86576	and their brethren the sons of Kish took them.
c86577	The sons of Mushi; Mahli, and Eder, and Jeremoth, three.
c86578	These <i>were</i> the sons of Levi after the house of their fathers; <i>even</i> the chief of the fathers, as they were counted by number of names by their polls,
c86579	that did the work for the service of the house of the LORD,
c86580	from the age of twenty years and upward.
c86581	For David said,
c86582	The LORD God of Israel hath given rest unto his people,
c86583	that they may dwell in Jerusalem for ever:
c86584	And also unto the Levites; they shall no
c86585	<i>more</i> carry the tabernacle, nor any vessels of it for the service thereof.
c86586	For by the last words of David the Levites <i>were</i> numbered from twenty years old and above:
c86587	Because their office <i>was</i> to wait on the sons of Aaron for the service of the house of the LORD, in the courts, and in the chambers,
c86588	and in the purifying of all holy things, and the work of the service of the house of God;
c86589	Both for the shewbread, and for the fine flour for meat offering, and for the unleavened cakes, and for <i>that which is baked in</i> the pan, and for that which is fried, and for all manner of measure and size;
c86590	And to stand every morning
c86591	to thank
c86592	and praise the LORD,
c86593	and likewise at even;
c86595	And to offer all burnt sacrifices unto the LORD in the sabbaths, in the new moons, and on the set feasts, by number, according to the order commanded unto them, continually before the LORD:
c86596	And that they should keep the charge of the tabernacle of the congregation, and the charge of the holy <i>place,</i> and the charge of the sons of Aaron their brethren, in the service of the house of the LORD.
c86597	Now <i>these are</i> the divisions of the sons of Aaron.
c86598	The sons of Aaron; Nadab, and Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar.
c86599	But Nadab and Abihu died before their father,
c86600	and had no children:
c86601	therefore Eleazar and Ithamar executed the priest's office.
c86602	And David distributed
c86603	them, both Zadok of the sons of Eleazar, and Ahimelech of the sons of Ithamar,
c86604	according to their offices in their service.
c86606	And there were more chief men found of the sons of Eleazar than of the sons of Ithamar;
c86607	and <i>thus</i> were they divided.
c86608	Among the sons of Eleazar <i>there were</i> sixteen chief men of the house of <i>their</i> fathers,
c86609	and eight among the sons of Ithamar according to the house of their fathers.
c86610	Thus were they divided by lot,
c86611	one sort with another;
c86612	for the governors of the sanctuary, and governors <i>of the house</i> of God, were of the sons of Eleazar, and of the sons of Ithamar.
c86613	And Shemaiah the son of Nethaneel the scribe, <i>one</i> of the Levites, wrote them before the king, and the princes, and Zadok the priest, and Ahimelech the son of Abiathar, and <i>before</i> the chief of the fathers of the priests and Levites:
c86614	one principal household being taken for Eleazar,
c86615	and <i>one</i> taken for Ithamar.
c86616	Now the first lot came forth to Jehoiarib,
c86617	the second to Jedaiah,
c86618	The third to Harim,
c86619	the fourth to Seorim,
c86620	The fifth to Malchijah,
c86621	the sixth to Mijamin,
c86622	The seventh to Hakkoz,
c86623	the eighth to Abijah,
c86624	The ninth to Jeshua,
c86625	the tenth to Shecaniah,
c86626	The eleventh to Eliashib,
c86627	the twelfth to Jakim,
c86628	The thirteenth to Huppah,
c86629	the fourteenth to Jeshebeab,
c86630	The fifteenth to Bilgah,
c86631	the sixteenth to Immer,
c86632	The seventeenth to Hezir,
c86633	the eighteenth to Aphses,
c86634	The nineteenth to Pethahiah,
c86635	the twentieth to Jehezekel,
c86636	The one and twentieth to Jachin,
c86637	the two and twentieth to Gamul,
c86638	The three and twentieth to Delaiah,
c86639	the four and twentieth to Maaziah.
c86640	These <i>were</i> the orderings of them in their service
c86641	to come into the house of the LORD, according to their manner, under Aaron their father,
c86642	as the LORD God of Israel had commanded him.
c86643	of the sons of Levi
c86644	And the rest
c86645	<i>were these:</i> Of the sons of Amram; Shubael:
c86646	of the sons of Shubael; Jehdeiah.
c86647	Concerning Rehabiah: of the sons of Rehabiah,
c86648	the first <i>was</i> Isshiah.
c86649	Of the Izharites; Shelomoth:
c86650	of the sons of Shelomoth; Jahath.
c86651	And the sons <i>of Hebron;</i> Jeriah
c86652	<i>the first,</i> Amariah the second,
c86653	Jahaziel the third,
c86654	Jekameam the fourth.
c86655	<i>Of</i> the sons of Uzziel; Michah:
c86656	of the sons of Michah; Shamir.
c86657	The brother of Michah <i>was</i> Isshiah:
c86658	of the sons of Isshiah; Zechariah.
c86659	The sons of Merari <i>were</i> Mahli and Mushi:
c86660	the sons of Jaaziah; Beno.
c86661	The sons of Merari by Jaaziah; Beno,
c86662	and Shoham, and Zaccur, and Ibri.
c86663	Of Mahli <i>came</i> Eleazar,
c86664	who had no sons.
c86665	Concerning Kish:
c86666	the son of Kish <i>was</i> Jerahmeel.
c86667	The sons also of Mushi; Mahli, and Eder, and Jerimoth.
c86668	These <i>were</i> the sons of the Levites after the house of their fathers.
c86669	These likewise cast lots over against their brethren the sons of Aaron in the presence of David the king, and Zadok, and Ahimelech, and the chief of the fathers of the priests and Levites,
c86670	even the principal fathers over against their younger brethren.
c86671	Moreover David and the captains of the host separated to the service of the sons of Asaph, and of Heman, and of Jeduthun,
c86672	who should prophesy with harps, with psalteries, and with cymbals:
c86673	and the number of the workmen according to their service was:
c86674	Of the sons of Asaph; Zaccur, and Joseph, and Nethaniah, and Asarelah,
c86675	the sons of Asaph under the hands of Asaph,
c86676	which prophesied according to the order of the king.
c86677	Of Jeduthun:
c86678	the sons of Jeduthun; Gedaliah, and Zeri, and Jeshaiah, Hashabiah, and Mattithiah, six,
c86679	under the hands of their father Jeduthun, who prophesied with a harp,
c86681	to give thanks
c86682	and to praise the LORD.
c86683	Of Heman:
c86684	the sons of Heman; Bukkiah, Mattaniah, Uzziel, Shebuel, and Jerimoth, Hananiah, Hanani, Eliathah, Giddalti, and Romamtiezer, Joshbekashah, Mallothi, Hothir, <i>and</i> Mahazioth:
c86685	All these <i>were</i> the sons of Heman the king's seer in the words of God,
c86686	to lift up the horn.
c86687	And God gave to Heman fourteen sons and three daughters.
c86688	All these <i>were</i> under the hands of their father for song <i>in</i> the house of the LORD, with cymbals, psalteries, and harps, for the service of the house of God, according to the king's order to Asaph, Jeduthun, and Heman.
c86689	So the number of them, with their brethren that were instructed in the songs of the LORD, <i>even</i> all
c86691	that were cunning, was
c86692	two hundred fourscore and eight.
c86693	And they cast lots, ward against <i>ward,</i> as well the small as the great, the teacher as the scholar.
c86694	Now the first lot came forth for Asaph to Joseph:
c86695	the second to Gedaliah,
c86696	who with his brethren and sons <i>were</i> twelve:
c86697	The third to Zaccur,
c86698	<i>he,</i> his sons, and his brethren, <i>were</i> twelve:
c86699	The fourth to Izri,
c86700	<i>he,</i> his sons, and his brethren, <i>were</i> twelve:

c86707	The eighth to Jeshaiah,
c86708	<i>he,</i> his sons, and his brethren, <i>were</i> twelve:

c86718	<i>he,</i> his sons, and his brethren, <i>were</i> twelve:
c86719	The fourteenth to Mattithiah,
c86720	<i>he,</i> his sons, and his brethren, <i>were</i> twelve:

c86727	The eighteenth to Hanani,
c86728	<i>he,</i> his sons, and his brethren, <i>were</i> twelve:
c86729	The nineteenth to Mallothi,
c86730	<i>he,</i> his sons, and his brethren, <i>were</i> twelve:
c86731	The twentieth to Eliathah,
c86732	<i>he,</i> his sons, and his brethren, <i>were</i> twelve:
c86733	The one and twentieth to Hothir,
c86734	<i>he,</i> his sons, and his brethren, <i>were</i> twelve:
c86735	The two and twentieth to Giddalti,
c86736	<i>he,</i> his sons, and his brethren, <i>were</i> twelve:
c86737	The three and twentieth to Mahazioth,
c86738	<i>he,</i> his sons, and his brethren, <i>were</i> twelve:
c86739	The four and twentieth to Romamtiezer,
c86740	<i>he,</i> his sons, and his brethren, <i>were</i> twelve.
c86741	Concerning the divisions of the porters:
c86742	Of the Korhites <i>was</i> Meshelemiah the son of Kore, of the sons of Asaph.
c86743	And the sons of Meshelemiah
c86744	<i>were,</i> Zechariah the firstborn,
c86745	Jediael the second,
c86746	Zebadiah the third,
c86747	Jathniel the fourth,
c86748	Elam the fifth,
c86749	Jehohanan the sixth,
c86750	Elioenai the seventh.
c86751	Moreover the sons of Obededom
c86752	<i>were,</i> Shemaiah the firstborn,
c86753	Jehozabad the second,
c86754	Joah the third,
c86755	and Sacar the fourth,
c86756	and Nethaneel the fifth,
c86757	Ammiel the sixth,
c86758	Issachar the seventh,
c86759	Peulthai the eighth:
c86760	for God blessed him.
c86761	Also unto Shemaiah his son were sons born, that ruled throughout the house of their father:
c86762	for they <i>were</i> mighty men of valour.
c86763	The sons of Shemaiah; Othni, and Rephael, and Obed, Elzabad,
c86764	whose brethren <i>were</i> strong men,
c86765	Elihu, and Semachiah.
c86766	All these of the sons of Obededom:
c86767	they and their sons and their brethren, able men for strength for the service,
c86768	<i>were</i> threescore and two of Obededom.
c86769	And Meshelemiah had sons and brethren, strong men, eighteen.
c86770	Also Hosah, of the children of Merari, had sons;
c86771	Simri the chief,
c86772	(for <i>though</i> he was not the firstborn,
c86773	yet his father made him the chief;)
c86774	Hilkiah the second,
c86775	Tebaliah the third,
c86776	Zechariah the fourth:
c86777	all the sons and brethren of Hosah <i>were</i> thirteen.
c86778	Among these <i>were</i> the divisions of the porters, <i>even</i> among the chief men, <i>having</i> wards one against another,
c86779	to minister in the house of the LORD.
c86780	And they cast lots, as well the small as the great, according to the house of their fathers, for every gate.
c86781	And the lot eastward fell to Shelemiah.
c86782	Then for Zechariah his son, a wise counsellor,
c86783	they cast lots;
c86784	and his lot came out northward.
c86785	To Obededom southward;
c86786	and to his sons the house of Asuppim.
c86787	To Shuppim and Hosah <i>the lot came forth</i> westward, with the gate Shallecheth, by the causeway
c86788	of the going up, ward against ward.
c86789	Eastward <i>were</i> six Levites,
c86790	northward four a day,
c86791	southward four a day,
c86792	and toward Asuppim two <i>and</i> two.
c86793	At Parbar westward,
c86794	four at the causeway,
c86795	<i>and</i> two at Parbar.
c86796	These <i>are</i> the divisions of the porters among the sons of Kore, and among the sons of Merari.
c86797	And of the Levites,
c86798	Ahijah <i>was</i> over the treasures of the house of God, and over the treasures of the dedicated things.
c86799	<i>As concerning</i> the sons of Laadan;
c86800	the sons of the Gershonite Laadan, chief fathers, <i>even</i> of Laadan the Gershonite,
c86801	<i>were</i> Jehieli.
c86802	The sons of Jehieli;
c86803	Zetham, and Joel his brother, <i>which were</i> over the treasures of the house of the LORD.
c86804	Of the Amramites, <i>and</i> the Izharites, the Hebronites, <i>and</i> the Uzzielites:
c86805	And Shebuel the son of Gershom, the son of Moses, <i>was</i> ruler of the treasures.
c86806	And his brethren by Eliezer; Rehabiah his son, and Jeshaiah his son, and Joram his son, and Zichri his son, and Shelomith his son.
c86807	Which Shelomith and his brethren <i>were</i> over all the treasures of the dedicated things,
c86808	which David the king, and the chief fathers, the captains over thousands and hundreds, and the captains of the host, had dedicated.
c86809	Out of the spoils won in battles did they dedicate
c86810	to maintain the house of the LORD.
c86811	And all
c86812	that Samuel the seer, and Saul the son of Kish, and Abner the son of Ner, and Joab the son of Zeruiah, had dedicated;
c86813	<i>and</i> whosoever
c86814	had dedicated
c86815	<i>any thing, it was</i> under the hand of Shelomith, and of his brethren.
c86816	Of the Izharites,
c86817	Chenaniah and his sons <i>were</i> for the outward business over Israel, for officers and judges.
c86818	<i>And</i> of the Hebronites,
c86819	Hashabiah and his brethren, men of valour, a thousand and seven hundred, <i>were</i> officers among them of Israel on this side Jordan westward in all the business of the LORD, and in the service of the king.
c86820	Among the Hebronites
c86821	<i>was</i> Jerijah the chief, <i>even</i> among the Hebronites, according to the generations of his fathers.
c86822	In the fortieth year of the reign of David they were sought for,
c86823	and there were found among them mighty men of valour at Jazer of Gilead.
c86824	And his brethren, men of valour, <i>were</i> two thousand and seven hundred chief fathers,
c86825	whom king David made rulers over the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half tribe of Manasseh, for every matter pertaining to God, and affairs of the king.
c86826	Now the children of Israel after their number, <i>to wit,</i> the chief fathers and captains of thousands and hundreds, and their officers
c86827	that served the king in any matter of the courses,
c86828	which came in
c86829	and went out
c86830	month by month throughout all the months of the year,
c86831	of every course <i>were</i> twenty and four thousand.
c86832	Over the first course for the first month <i>was</i> Jashobeam the son of Zabdiel:
c86833	and in his course <i>were</i> twenty and four thousand.
c86834	Of the children of Perez <i>was</i> the chief of all the captains of the host for the first month.
c86835	And over the course of the second month <i>was</i> Dodai an Ahohite, and of his course
c86836	<i>was</i> Mikloth also the ruler:
c86837	in his course likewise <i>were</i> twenty and four thousand.
c86838	The third captain of the host for the third month <i>was</i> Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, a chief priest:
c86839	and in his course <i>were</i> twenty and four thousand.
c86840	This <i>is that</i> Benaiah, <i>who was</i> mighty <i>among</i> the thirty,
c86841	and above the thirty:
c86842	and in his course <i>was</i> Ammizabad his son.
c86843	The fourth <i>captain</i> for the fourth month <i>was</i> Asahel the brother of Joab,
c86844	and Zebadiah his son after
c86845	him: and in his course <i>were</i> twenty and four thousand.
c86846	The fifth captain for the fifth month <i>was</i> Shamhuth the Izrahite:
c86847	and in his course <i>were</i> twenty and four thousand.
c86848	The sixth <i>captain</i> for the sixth month <i>was</i> Ira the son of Ikkesh the Tekoite:
c86849	and in his course <i>were</i> twenty and four thousand.
c86850	The seventh <i>captain</i> for the seventh month <i>was</i> Helez the Pelonite, of the children of Ephraim:
c86851	and in his course <i>were</i> twenty and four thousand.
c86852	The eighth <i>captain</i> for the eighth month <i>was</i> Sibbecai the Hushathite, of the Zarhites:
c86853	and in his course <i>were</i> twenty and four thousand.
c86854	The ninth <i>captain</i> for the ninth month <i>was</i> Abiezer the Anetothite, of the Benjamites:
c86855	and in his course <i>were</i> twenty and four thousand.
c86856	The tenth <i>captain</i> for the tenth month <i>was</i> Maharai the Netophathite, of the Zarhites:
c86857	and in his course <i>were</i> twenty and four thousand.
c86858	The eleventh <i>captain</i> for the eleventh month <i>was</i> Benaiah the Pirathonite, of the children of Ephraim:
c86859	and in his course <i>were</i> twenty and four thousand.
c86860	The twelfth <i>captain</i> for the twelfth month <i>was</i> Heldai the Netophathite, of Othniel:
c86861	and in his course <i>were</i> twenty and four thousand.
c86862	Furthermore over the tribes of Israel:
c86863	the ruler of the Reubenites <i>was</i> Eliezer the son of Zichri:
c86864	of the Simeonites, Shephatiah the son of Maachah:
c86865	Of the Levites, Hashabiah the son of Kemuel:
c86866	of the Aaronites, Zadok:
c86867	Of Judah, Elihu, <i>one</i> of the brethren of David:
c86868	of Issachar, Omri the son of Michael:
c86869	Of Zebulun, Ishmaiah the son of Obadiah:
c86870	of Naphtali, Jerimoth the son of Azriel:
c86871	Of the children of Ephraim, Hoshea the son of Azaziah:
c86872	of the half tribe of Manasseh, Joel the son of Pedaiah:
c86873	Of the half <i>tribe</i> of Manasseh in Gilead, Iddo the son of Zechariah:
c86874	of Benjamin, Jaasiel the son of Abner:
c86875	Of Dan, Azareel the son of Jeroham.
c86876	These <i>were</i> the princes of the tribes of Israel.
c86877	But David took not the number of them from twenty years old and under:
c86878	because the LORD had said
c86879	he would increase Israel like to the stars of the heavens.
c86880	Joab the son of Zeruiah began
c86881	to number,
c86882	but he finished not,
c86883	because there fell
c86884	wrath for it against Israel;
c86885	neither was the number put in the account of the chronicles of king David.
c86886	And over the king's treasures <i>was</i> Azmaveth the son of Adiel:
c86887	and over the storehouses in the fields, in the cities, and in the villages, and in the castles, <i>was</i> Jehonathan the son of Uzziah:
c86888	And over them that did the work of the field for tillage of the ground <i>was</i> Ezri the son of Chelub:
c86889	And over the vineyards <i>was</i> Shimei the Ramathite:
c86891	over the increase of the vineyards for the wine cellars
c86892	<i>was</i> Zabdi the Shiphmite:
c86893	And over the olive trees and the sycomore trees
c86894	that <i>were</i> in the low plains
c86895	<i>was</i> Baalhanan the Gederite:
c86896	and over the cellars of oil <i>was</i> Joash:
c86897	And over the herds
c86898	that fed in Sharon
c86899	<i>was</i> Shitrai the Sharonite:
c86900	and over the herds <i>that were</i> in the valleys <i>was</i> Shaphat the son of Adlai:
c86901	Over the camels also <i>was</i> Obil the Ishmaelite:
c86902	and over the asses <i>was</i> Jehdeiah the Meronothite:
c86903	And over the flocks <i>was</i> Jaziz the Hagerite.
c86904	All these <i>were</i> the rulers of the substance
c86905	which <i>was</i> king David's.
c86906	Also Jonathan David's uncle was a counsellor,
c86907	a wise man, and a scribe:
c86908	and Jehiel the son of Hachmoni <i>was</i> with the king's sons:
c86909	And Ahithophel <i>was</i> the king's counsellor:
c86910	and Hushai the Archite <i>was</i> the king's companion:
c86911	And after Ahithophel <i>was</i> Jehoiada the son of Benaiah, and Abiathar:
c86912	and the general of the king's army <i>was</i> Joab.
c86913	And David assembled all the princes of Israel, the princes of the tribes, and the captains of the companies
c86914	that ministered to the king
c86915	by course, and the captains over the thousands, and captains over the hundreds, and the stewards over all the substance and possession of the king, and of his sons, with the officers, and with the mighty men, and with all the valiant men, unto Jerusalem.
c86916	Then David the king stood up upon his feet,
c86917	and said,
c86918	Hear
c86919	me, my brethren, and my people:
c86920	<i>As for me,</i> I <i>had</i> in mine heart
c86921	to build an house of rest for the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and for the footstool of our God,
c86922	and had made ready
c86923	for the building:
c86924	But God said
c86925	unto me, Thou shalt not build an house for my name,
c86926	because thou <i>hast been</i> a man of war,
c86927	and hast shed blood.
c86928	Howbeit the LORD God of Israel chose me before all the house of my father
c86929	to be king over Israel for ever:
c86930	for he hath chosen Judah <i>to be</i> the ruler;
c86931	and of the house of Judah, the house of my father;
c86932	and among the sons of my father he liked
c86933	me to make <i>me</i> king over all Israel:
c86934	And of all my sons,
c86935	(for the LORD hath given me many sons,)
c86936	he hath chosen Solomon my son
c86937	to sit upon the throne of the kingdom of the LORD over Israel.
c86938	And he said
c86939	unto me, Solomon thy son,
c86940	he shall build my house and my courts:
c86941	for I have chosen him <i>to be</i> my son,
c86942	and I will be his father.
c86943	Moreover I will establish his kingdom for ever,
c86944	if he be constant
c86945	to do my commandments and my judgments, as at this day.
c86946	Now
c86947	therefore in the sight of all Israel the congregation of the LORD, and in the audience of our God,
c86948	keep
c86949	and seek for all the commandments of the LORD your God:
c86950	that ye may possess this good land,
c86951	and leave <i>it</i> for an inheritance for your children after you for ever.
c86952	And thou,
c86953	Solomon my son,
c86954	know thou the God of thy father,
c86955	and serve him with a perfect heart and with a willing mind:
c86956	for the LORD searcheth all hearts,
c86957	and understandeth all the imaginations of the thoughts:
c86958	if thou seek
c86959	him, he will be found
c86960	of thee; but if thou forsake
c86961	him, he will cast thee off for ever.
c86962	Take heed now;
c86963	for the LORD hath chosen
c86964	thee to build an house for the sanctuary:
c86965	be strong,
c86966	and do <i>it.</i>
c86967	Then David gave to Solomon his son the pattern of the porch, and of the houses thereof, and of the treasuries thereof, and of the upper chambers thereof, and of the inner parlours thereof, and of the place of the mercy seat,
c86968	And the pattern of all
c86969	that he had by the spirit, of the courts of the house of the LORD, and of all the chambers round about, of the treasuries of the house of God, and of the treasuries of the dedicated things:
c86970	Also for the courses of the priests and the Levites, and for all the work of the service of the house of the LORD, and for all the vessels of service in the house of the LORD.
c86971	<i>He gave</i> of gold by weight for <i>things</i> of gold, for all instruments of all manner of service;
c86972	<i>silver also</i> for all instruments of silver by weight, for all instruments of every kind of service:
c86973	Even the weight for the candlesticks of gold, and for their lamps of gold, by weight for every candlestick, and for the lamps
c86974	thereof: and for the candlesticks of silver by weight, <i>both</i> for the candlestick, and <i>also</i> for the lamps thereof, according to the use of every candlestick.
c86975	And by weight <i>he gave</i> gold for the tables of shewbread, for every table;
c86976	and <i>likewise</i> silver for the tables of silver:
c86977	Also pure gold for the fleshhooks, and the bowls, and the cups:
c86978	and for the golden basons <i>he gave gold</i> by weight for every bason;
c86979	and <i>likewise silver</i> by weight for every bason of silver:
c86980	And for the altar of incense refined gold by weight;
c86981	and gold for the pattern of the chariot of the cherubims,
c86982	that spread out
c86983	<i>their wings,</i> and covered the ark of the covenant of the LORD.
c86984	All
c86985	<i>this, said David,</i> the LORD made me understand in writing by <i>his</i> hand upon me, <i>even</i> all the works of this pattern.
c86986	And David said to Solomon his son,
c86987	Be strong
c86988	and of good courage,
c86989	and do
c86990	<i>it:</i> fear not,
c86991	nor be dismayed:
c86992	for the LORD God, <i>even</i> my God, <i>will be</i> with
c86993	thee; he will not fail
c86994	thee, nor forsake
c86995	thee, until thou hast finished all the work for the service of the house of the LORD.
c86996	And, behold,
c86997	the courses of the priests and the Levites, <i>even they shall be with thee</i> for all the service of the house of God:
c86998	and <i>there shall be</i> with thee for all manner of workmanship every willing skilful man, for any manner of service:
c86999	also the princes and all the people <i>will be</i> wholly at thy commandment.
c87000	Furthermore David the king said unto all the congregation,
c87001	Solomon my son,
c87002	whom alone God hath chosen,
c87003	<i>is yet</i> young
c87004	and tender,
c87005	and the work <i>is</i> great:
c87006	for the palace <i>is</i> not for man,
c87007	but for the LORD God.
c87008	Now I have prepared with all my might for the house of my God the gold for <i>things to be made</i> of gold,
c87009	and the silver for <i>things</i> of silver,
c87010	and the brass for <i>things</i> of brass,
c87011	the iron for <i>things</i> of iron,
c87012	and wood for <i>things</i> of wood;
c87013	onyx stones, and <i>stones</i> to be set, glistering stones, and of divers colours, and all manner of precious stones, and marble stones in abundance.
c87014	Moreover,
c87015	because I have set my affection to the house of my God,
c87016	I have of mine own proper good,
c87017	of gold and silver, <i>which</i> I have given to the house of my God, over and above all
c87018	that I have prepared for the holy house,
c87019	<i>Even</i> three thousand talents of gold, of the gold of Ophir, and seven thousand talents of refined silver,
c87020	to overlay the walls of the houses <i>withal:</i>
c87021	The gold for <i>things</i> of gold,
c87022	and the silver for <i>things</i> of silver, and for all manner of work <i>to be made</i> by the hands of artificers.
c87023	And who <i>then</i> is willing
c87024	to consecrate his service this day unto the LORD?
c87025	Then the chief of the fathers and princes of the tribes of Israel, and the captains of thousands and of hundreds, with the rulers of the king's work, offered willingly,
c87026	And gave for the service of the house of God of gold five thousand talents and ten thousand drams, and of silver ten thousand talents, and of brass eighteen thousand talents, and one hundred thousand talents of iron.
c87028	And they with whom <i>precious</i> stones were found
c87029	gave <i>them</i> to the treasure of the house of the LORD, by the hand of Jehiel the Gershonite.
c87030	Then the people rejoiced,
c87031	for that they offered willingly,
c87032	because with perfect heart they offered willingly to the LORD:
c87033	and David the king also rejoiced with great joy.
c87034	Wherefore David blessed the LORD before all the congregation:
c87035	and David said,
c87036	Blessed <i>be</i> thou,
c87037	LORD God of Israel our father,
c87038	for ever and ever.
c87040	Thine, O LORD,
c87041	<i>is</i> the greatness, and the power, and the glory, and the victory, and the majesty:
c87042	for all <i>that is</i> in the heaven and in the earth
c87043	O LORD,
c87044	<i>is thine;</i> thine <i>is</i> the kingdom,
c87045	and thou art exalted as head above all.
c87046	Both riches and honour <i>come</i> of
c87047	thee, and thou reignest over all;
c87048	and in thine hand <i>is</i> power and might;
c87049	and in thine hand
c87050	<i>it is</i> to make great,
c87051	and to give strength unto all.
c87052	Now
c87053	therefore, our God,
c87054	we thank
c87055	thee, and praise thy glorious name.
c87056	But who <i>am</i> I,
c87057	and what <i>is</i> my people,
c87058	that we should be able
c87059	to offer so willingly after this sort?
c87060	for all things <i>come</i> of
c87061	thee, and of thine own have we given thee.
c87062	For we <i>are</i> strangers before
c87063	thee, and sojourners, as <i>were</i> all our fathers:
c87064	our days on the earth <i>are</i> as a shadow,
c87065	and <i>there is</i> none abiding.
c87066	O LORD our God,
c87067	all this store
c87068	that we have prepared
c87069	to build thee an house for thine holy name
c87070	<i>cometh</i> of thine hand,
c87071	and <i>is</i> all thine own.
c87072	I know
c87073	also, my God,
c87074	that thou triest the heart,
c87075	and hast pleasure in uprightness. As for me, in the uprightness
c87076	of mine heart I have willingly offered all these things:
c87077	and now
c87078	thy people,
c87079	which are present here,
c87080	have I seen with joy
c87081	to offer willingly unto thee.
c87082	O LORD God of Abraham, Isaac, and of Israel, our fathers,
c87083	keep this for ever in the imagination of the thoughts of the heart of thy people,
c87084	and prepare their heart unto thee:
c87085	And give unto Solomon my son a perfect heart,
c87086	to keep thy commandments, thy testimonies, and thy statutes,
c87087	and to do all
c87088	<i>these things,</i> and to build the palace,
c87089	<i>for</i> the which I have made provision.
c87090	And David said to all the congregation,
c87091	Now bless the LORD your God.
c87092	And all the congregation blessed the LORD God of their fathers,
c87093	and bowed down their heads,
c87094	and worshipped the LORD, and the king.
c87095	And they sacrificed sacrifices unto the LORD,
c87096	and offered burnt offerings unto the LORD, on the morrow after that day,
c87097	<i>even</i> a thousand bullocks, a thousand rams, <i>and</i> a thousand lambs, with their drink offerings, and sacrifices in abundance
c87098	for all Israel:
c87099	And did eat
c87100	and drink before the LORD on that day with great gladness.
c87101	And they made Solomon the son of David king the second time,
c87102	and anointed <i>him</i> unto the LORD <i>to be</i> the chief governor,
c87103	and Zadok <i>to be</i> priest.
c87104	Then Solomon sat on the throne of the LORD as king instead of David his father,
c87105	and prospered;
c87106	and all Israel obeyed him.
c87107	And all the princes, and the mighty men, and all the sons likewise of king David, submitted themselves unto Solomon the king.
c87108	And the LORD magnified Solomon exceedingly in the sight of all Israel,
c87109	and bestowed upon him <i>such</i> royal majesty
c87110	as had not been on any king before him in Israel.
c87111	Thus David the son of Jesse reigned over all Israel.
c87112	And the time
c87113	that he reigned over Israel
c87114	<i>was</i> forty years;
c87115	seven years reigned he in Hebron,
c87116	and thirty and three <i>years</i> reigned he in Jerusalem.
c87117	And he died in a good old age, full of days, riches, and honour:
c87118	and Solomon his son reigned in his stead.
c87119	Now the acts of David the king, first and last,
c87120	behold, they <i>are</i> written in the book of Samuel the seer, and in the book of Nathan the prophet, and in the book of Gad the seer,
c87121	With all his reign and his might, and the times
c87122	that went over him, and over Israel, and over all the kingdoms of the countries.
c87123	And Solomon the son of David was strengthened in his kingdom,
c87124	and the LORD his God <i>was</i> with
c87125	him, and magnified him exceedingly.
c87126	Then Solomon spake unto all Israel, to the captains of thousands and of hundreds, and to the judges, and to every governor in all Israel, the chief of the fathers.
c87127	So Solomon, and all the congregation with him, went to the high place
c87128	that <i>was</i> at Gibeon;
c87129	for there was the tabernacle of the congregation of God,
c87130	which Moses the servant of the LORD had made in the wilderness.
c87131	But the ark of God had David brought up from Kirjathjearim
c87132	to <i>the place which</i> David had prepared
c87133	for it: for he had pitched a tent for it at Jerusalem.
c87134	Moreover the brasen altar,
c87135	that Bezaleel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, had made,
c87136	he put before the tabernacle of the LORD:
c87137	and Solomon and the congregation sought unto it.
c87138	And Solomon went up thither to the brasen altar before the LORD,
c87139	which <i>was</i> at the tabernacle of the congregation,
c87140	and offered a thousand burnt offerings upon it.
c87141	In that night did God appear unto Solomon,
c87142	and said
c87143	unto him, Ask
c87144	what I shall give thee.
c87145	And Solomon said unto God,
c87146	Thou hast shewed great mercy unto David my father,
c87147	and hast made me to reign in his stead.
c87148	Now,
c87149	O LORD God,
c87150	let thy promise unto David my father be established:
c87151	for thou hast made me king over a people
c87152	like the dust of the earth in multitude.
c87154	Give me now wisdom and knowledge,
c87155	that I may go out and come in before this people:
c87157	for who can judge this thy people, <i>that is so</i> great?
c87158	And God said to Solomon,
c87159	Because this was in thine heart,
c87160	and thou hast not asked riches, wealth, or honour,
c87161	nor the life of thine enemies,
c87162	neither yet hast asked long life;
c87163	but hast asked wisdom and knowledge
c87164	for thyself, that thou mayest judge my people,
c87165	over whom I have made thee king:
c87166	Wisdom and knowledge <i>is</i> granted
c87167	unto thee; and I will give thee riches, and wealth, and honour,
c87168	such as none of the kings have had
c87169	that <i>have been</i> before
c87170	thee, neither shall there any after thee have the like.
c87171	Then Solomon came <i>from his journey</i> to the high place
c87172	that <i>was</i> at Gibeon
c87173	to Jerusalem,
c87174	from before the tabernacle of the congregation,
c87175	and reigned over Israel.
c87176	And Solomon gathered chariots and horsemen:
c87177	and he had a thousand and four hundred chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen,
c87178	which he placed in the chariot cities, and with the king at Jerusalem.
c87179	And the king made silver and gold at Jerusalem <i>as plenteous</i> as stones,
c87180	and cedar trees made he as the sycomore trees
c87181	that <i>are</i> in the vale for abundance.
c87182	had horses brought out
c87183	And Solomon
c87184	of Egypt, and linen yarn:
c87185	the king's merchants received the linen yarn at a price.
c87186	And they fetched up,
c87187	and brought forth out of Egypt a chariot for six hundred <i>shekels</i> of silver,
c87188	and an horse for an hundred and fifty:
c87189	and so brought they out <i>horses</i> for all the kings of the Hittites, and for the kings of Syria,
c87190	by their means.
c87191	And Solomon determined
c87192	to build an house for the name of the LORD, and an house for his kingdom.
c87193	And Solomon told out threescore and ten thousand men to bear burdens, and fourscore thousand
c87194	to hew in the mountain,
c87195	and three thousand and six hundred to oversee them.
c87196	And Solomon sent to Huram the king of Tyre,
c87197	saying,
c87198	As thou didst deal with David my father,
c87199	and didst send him cedars
c87200	to build him an house
c87201	to dwell therein, <i>even so deal with me.</i>
c87202	Behold, I build an house to the name of the LORD my God,
c87203	to dedicate
c87204	<i>it</i> to him, <i>and</i> to burn before him sweet incense, and for the continual shewbread, and for the burnt offerings morning and evening, on the sabbaths, and on the new moons, and on the solemn feasts of the LORD our God.
c87205	This <i>is an ordinance</i> for ever to Israel.
c87206	And the house
c87207	which I build
c87208	<i>is</i> great:
c87209	for great <i>is</i> our God above all gods.
c87210	But who is able
c87211	to build him an house,
c87212	seeing the heaven and heaven of heavens cannot contain
c87213	him? who <i>am</i> I
c87214	then, that I should build him an house,
c87215	save only to burn sacrifice before him?
c87217	Send me now therefore a man cunning
c87218	to work in gold, and in silver, and in brass, and in iron, and in purple, and crimson, and blue,
c87219	and that can skill
c87220	to grave with the cunning men
c87221	that <i>are</i> with me in Judah and in Jerusalem,
c87222	whom David my father did provide.
c87223	Send me also cedar trees, fir trees, and algum trees, out of Lebanon:
c87224	for I know
c87225	that thy servants can skill
c87226	to cut timber in Lebanon;
c87227	and, behold, my servants <i>shall be</i> with thy servants,
c87228	Even to prepare me timber in abundance:
c87229	for the house
c87230	which I am about to build
c87231	<i>shall be</i> wonderful great.
c87232	And, behold, I will give to thy servants, the hewers that cut timber, twenty thousand measures of beaten wheat, and twenty thousand measures of barley, and twenty thousand baths of wine, and twenty thousand baths of oil.
c87233	Then Huram the king of Tyre answered in writing,
c87234	which he sent to Solomon,
c87235	Because the LORD hath loved his people, he hath made thee king over them.
c87236	Huram said
c87237	moreover, Blessed <i>be</i> the LORD God of Israel,
c87238	that made heaven and earth,
c87239	who hath given to David the king a wise son,
c87240	endued with prudence and understanding,
c87241	that might build an house for the LORD, and an house for his kingdom.
c87242	And now
c87243	I have sent a cunning man,
c87244	endued with understanding,
c87245	of Huram my father's,
c87246	The son of a woman of the daughters of Dan,
c87247	and his father <i>was</i> a man of Tyre,
c87248	skilful
c87249	to work in gold, and in silver, in brass, in iron, in stone, and in timber, in purple, in blue, and in fine linen, and in crimson;
c87250	also to grave any manner of graving,
c87251	and to find out every device
c87252	which shall be put
c87253	to him, with thy cunning men, and with the cunning men of my lord David thy father.
c87254	Now
c87255	therefore the wheat, and the barley, the oil, and the wine,
c87256	which my lord hath spoken
c87257	of, let him send unto his servants:
c87258	And we will cut wood out of Lebanon, as much as thou shalt need:
c87259	and we will bring it to thee in floats by sea to Joppa;
c87260	and thou shalt carry it up to Jerusalem.
c87261	And Solomon numbered all the strangers
c87262	that <i>were</i> in the land of Israel,
c87263	after the numbering
c87264	wherewith David his father had numbered
c87265	them; and they were found an hundred and fifty thousand and three thousand and six hundred.
c87266	And he set threescore and ten thousand of them <i>to be</i> bearers of burdens,
c87267	and fourscore thousand <i>to be</i> hewers in the mountain,
c87268	and three thousand and six hundred overseers
c87269	to set the people a work.
c87270	Then Solomon began
c87271	to build the house of the LORD at Jerusalem in mount Moriah,
c87272	where <i>the LORD</i> appeared unto David his father,
c87273	in the place that David had prepared in the threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite.
c87274	And he began
c87275	to build in the second <i>day</i> of the second month, in the fourth year of his reign.
c87276	Now these <i>are the things wherein</i> Solomon was instructed
c87277	for the building of the house of God.
c87278	The length by cubits after the first measure <i>was</i> threescore cubits,
c87279	and the breadth twenty cubits.
c87280	And the porch
c87281	that <i>was</i> in the front <i>of the house,</i> the length <i>of it was</i> according to the breadth of the house,
c87282	twenty cubits,
c87283	and the height <i>was</i> an hundred and twenty:
c87284	and he overlaid it within with pure gold.
c87285	And the greater house he cieled with fir tree,
c87286	which he overlaid with fine gold,
c87287	and set thereon palm trees and chains.
c87288	And he garnished the house with precious stones for beauty:
c87289	and the gold <i>was</i> gold of Parvaim.
c87290	He overlaid also the house, the beams, the posts, and the walls thereof, and the doors thereof, with gold;
c87291	and graved cherubims on the walls.
c87292	And he made the most holy house,
c87293	the length whereof <i>was</i> according to the breadth of the house, twenty cubits,
c87294	and the breadth thereof twenty cubits:
c87295	and he overlaid it with fine gold, <i>amounting</i> to six hundred talents.
c87296	And the weight of the nails <i>was</i> fifty shekels of gold.
c87297	And he overlaid the upper chambers with gold.
c87298	And in the most holy house he made two cherubims of image work,
c87299	and overlaid them with gold.
c87300	And the wings of the cherubims
c87301	<i>were</i> twenty cubits long:
c87302	one wing <i>of the one cherub was</i> five cubits,
c87303	reaching to the wall of the house:
c87304	and the other wing <i>was likewise</i> five cubits,
c87305	reaching to the wing of the other cherub.
c87306	And <i>one</i> wing of the other cherub <i>was</i> five cubits,
c87307	reaching to the wall of the house:
c87308	and the other wing <i>was</i> five cubits
c87309	<i>also,</i> joining to the wing of the other cherub.
c87310	The wings of these cherubims spread themselves forth twenty cubits:
c87311	and they stood on their feet,
c87312	and their faces <i>were</i> inward.
c87313	And he made the vail <i>of</i> blue, and purple, and crimson, and fine linen,
c87314	and wrought cherubims thereon.
c87315	Also he made before the house two pillars
c87316	of thirty and five cubits high,
c87317	and the chapiter
c87318	that <i>was</i> on the top
c87319	of each of them <i>was</i> five cubits.
c87320	And he made chains, <i>as</i> in the oracle,
c87321	and put <i>them</i> on the heads of the pillars;
c87322	and made an hundred pomegranates,
c87323	and put <i>them</i> on the chains.
c87324	And he reared up the pillars before the temple,
c87325	one on the right hand,
c87326	and the other on the left; and called the name of that on the right hand Jachin,
c87328	and the name of that on the left Boaz.
c87329	Moreover he made an altar of brass,
c87330	twenty cubits the length
c87331	thereof, and twenty cubits the breadth
c87332	thereof, and ten cubits the height thereof.
c87333	Also he made a molten sea
c87334	of ten cubits from brim to brim,
c87335	round in compass,
c87336	and five cubits the height
c87337	thereof; and a line of thirty cubits did compass it round about.
c87338	And under it <i>was</i> the similitude of oxen, which did compass it round about:
c87340	ten in a cubit, compassing the sea round about.
c87341	Two rows of oxen <i>were</i> cast, when it was cast.
c87342	It stood upon twelve oxen,
c87343	three looking toward the north,
c87344	and three looking toward the west,
c87345	and three looking toward the south,
c87346	and three looking toward the east:
c87347	and the sea <i>was set</i> above upon
c87348	them, and all their hinder parts <i>were</i> inward.
c87349	And the thickness of it <i>was</i> an handbreadth,
c87350	and the brim of it like the work of the brim of a cup,
c87351	with flowers of lilies; <i>and</i> it received
c87352	and held three thousand baths.
c87353	He made also ten lavers,
c87354	and put five on the right hand,
c87355	and five on the left,
c87356	to wash
c87357	in them: such things as they offered for the burnt offering they washed
c87358	in them; but the sea
c87359	<i>was</i> for the priests to wash in.
c87360	And he made ten candlesticks of gold according to their form,
c87361	and set <i>them</i> in the temple, five on the right hand,
c87362	and five on the left.
c87363	He made also ten tables,
c87364	and placed <i>them</i> in the temple, five on the right side,
c87365	and five on the left.
c87366	And he made an hundred basons of gold.
c87367	Furthermore he made the court of the priests, and the great court, and doors for the court,
c87368	and overlaid the doors of them with brass.
c87369	And he set the sea on the right side of the east end, over against the south.
c87370	And Huram made the pots, and the shovels, and the basons.
c87371	And Huram finished the work
c87373	that he was to make for king Solomon for the house of God;
c87374	<i>To wit,</i> the two pillars, and the pommels, and the chapiters <i>which were</i> on the top of the two pillars, and the two wreaths
c87375	to cover the two pommels of the chapiters
c87376	which <i>were</i> on the top of the pillars;
c87377	And four hundred pomegranates on the two wreaths;
c87378	two rows of pomegranates on each wreath,
c87379	to cover the two pommels of the chapiters
c87380	which <i>were</i> upon the pillars.
c87381	He made also bases,
c87382	and lavers made he upon the bases;
c87383	One sea, and twelve oxen under it.
c87384	The pots also, and the shovels, and the fleshhooks, and all their instruments, did Huram his father make to king Solomon for the house of the LORD of bright brass.
c87385	In the plain of Jordan did the king cast them, in the clay ground between Succoth and Zeredathah.
c87386	Thus Solomon made all these vessels in great abundance:
c87387	for the weight of the brass could not be found out.
c87388	And Solomon made all the vessels
c87389	that <i>were for</i> the house of God,
c87390	the golden altar also, and the tables
c87391	whereon the shewbread <i>was set;</i>
c87392	Moreover the candlesticks with their lamps,
c87393	that they should burn after the manner before the oracle,
c87394	of pure gold;
c87395	And the flowers, and the lamps, and the tongs, <i>made he of</i> gold,
c87396	<i>and</i> that perfect gold;
c87397	And the snuffers, and the basons, and the spoons, and the censers, <i>of</i> pure gold:
c87398	and the entry of the house, the inner doors thereof for the most holy <i>place,</i> and the doors of the house of the temple, <i>were of</i> gold.
c87399	Thus all the work that Solomon made for the house of the LORD was finished:
c87401	and Solomon brought in <i>all</i> the things that David his father had dedicated;
c87402	and the silver, and the gold, and all the instruments, put he among the treasures of the house of God.
c87403	Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel, and all the heads of the tribes, the chief of the fathers of the children of Israel, unto Jerusalem,
c87404	to bring up the ark of the covenant of the LORD out of the city of David,
c87405	which <i>is</i> Zion.
c87406	Wherefore all the men of Israel assembled themselves unto the king in the feast
c87407	which <i>was</i> in the seventh month.
c87408	And all the elders of Israel came;
c87409	and the Levites took up the ark.
c87410	And they brought up the ark, and the tabernacle of the congregation, and all the holy vessels
c87411	that <i>were</i> in the tabernacle,
c87412	these did the priests <i>and</i> the Levites bring up.
c87413	Also king Solomon, and all the congregation of Israel
c87414	that were assembled unto him before the ark,
c87415	sacrificed sheep and oxen,
c87416	which could not be told
c87417	nor numbered for multitude.
c87418	And the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of the LORD unto his place, to the oracle of the house, into the most holy <i>place, even</i> under the wings of the cherubims:
c87419	For the cherubims spread forth <i>their</i> wings over the place of the ark,
c87420	and the cherubims covered the ark and the staves thereof above.
c87421	And they drew out the staves
c87422	<i>of the ark,</i> that the ends of the staves were seen from the ark before the oracle;
c87423	but they were not seen without.
c87424	And there it is unto this day.
c87425	<i>There was</i> nothing in the ark save the two tables
c87426	which Moses put <i>therein</i> at Horeb,
c87427	when the LORD made <i>a covenant</i> with the children of Israel,
c87428	when they came out of Egypt.
c87429	And it came to pass,
c87430	when the priests were come out of the holy
c87431	<i>place:</i> (for all the priests
c87432	<i>that were</i> present
c87433	were sanctified,
c87434	<i>and</i> did not
c87435	<i>then</i> wait by course:
c87436	Also the Levites
c87437	<i>which were</i> the singers, all of them of Asaph, of Heman, of Jeduthun, with their sons and their brethren,
c87438	<i>being</i> arrayed in white linen,
c87439	having cymbals and psalteries and harps, stood at the east end of the altar,
c87440	and with them an hundred and twenty priests sounding with trumpets:)
c87441	It came even to pass, as the trumpeters and singers <i>were</i> as one,
c87442	to make one sound to be heard
c87443	in praising
c87444	and thanking the LORD;
c87445	and when they lifted up <i>their</i> voice with the trumpets and cymbals and instruments of musick,
c87446	and praised the LORD,
c87447	<i>saying,</i> For <i>he is</i> good;
c87448	for his mercy <i>endureth</i> for ever:
c87449	that <i>then</i> the house was filled with a cloud, <i>even</i> the house of the LORD;
c87450	So that the priests could not
c87451	stand
c87452	to minister by reason of the cloud:
c87453	for the glory of the LORD had filled the house of God.
c87454	Then said Solomon,
c87455	The LORD hath said
c87456	that he would dwell in the thick darkness.
c87457	But I have built an house of habitation
c87458	for thee, and a place
c87459	for thy dwelling for ever.
c87460	And the king turned his face,
c87461	and blessed the whole congregation of Israel:
c87462	and all the congregation of Israel stood.
c87463	And he said,
c87464	Blessed <i>be</i> the LORD God of Israel,
c87465	<i>that</i> which he spake with his mouth to my father David,
c87466	who hath with his hands fulfilled
c87467	saying,
c87468	Since the day
c87469	that I brought forth my people out of the land of Egypt
c87470	I chose no city among all the tribes of Israel
c87471	to build an house
c87472	in, that my name might be there;
c87473	neither chose I any man
c87474	to be a ruler over my people Israel:
c87475	But I have chosen Jerusalem,
c87476	that my name might be there;
c87477	and have chosen David
c87478	to be over my people Israel.
c87479	Now it was in the heart of David my father
c87480	to build an house for the name of the LORD God of Israel.
c87481	But the LORD said to David my father,
c87482	in that it was in thine heart:
c87483	to build an house for my name,
c87484	thou didst well
c87485	Forasmuch as it was in thine heart
c87486	Notwithstanding thou shalt not build the house;
c87487	but thy son
c87488	which shall come forth out of thy loins,
c87489	he shall build the house for my name.
c87490	The LORD therefore hath performed his word
c87491	that he hath spoken:
c87492	for I am risen up in the room of David my father,
c87493	and am set on the throne of Israel,
c87494	as the LORD promised,
c87495	and have built the house for the name of the LORD God of Israel.
c87496	And in it have I put the ark,
c87497	wherein <i>is</i> the covenant of the LORD,
c87498	that he made with the children of Israel.
c87499	And he stood before the altar of the LORD in the presence of all the congregation of Israel,
c87500	and spread forth his hands:
c87501	For Solomon had made a brasen scaffold,
c87502	and had set it in the midst of the court:
c87503	of five cubits long,
c87504	and five cubits broad,
c87505	and three cubits high,
c87506	and upon it he stood,
c87507	and kneeled down upon his knees before all the congregation of Israel,
c87508	and spread forth his hands toward heaven,
c87509	And said,
c87510	O LORD God of Israel,
c87511	<i>there is</i> no God like thee in the heaven, nor in the earth;
c87512	which keepest covenant, and <i>shewest</i> mercy unto thy servants,
c87513	that walk before thee with all their hearts:
c87514	Thou which hast kept with thy servant David my father
c87515	that which thou hast promised
c87516	him; and spakest with thy mouth,
c87517	and hast fulfilled <i>it</i> with thine hand, as <i>it is</i> this day.
c87518	Now
c87519	therefore, O LORD God of Israel,
c87520	keep with thy servant David my father
c87521	that which thou hast promised
c87522	him, saying,
c87523	There shall not fail thee a man in my sight
c87524	to sit upon the throne of Israel;
c87525	yet so that thy children take heed to their way
c87526	to walk in my law,
c87527	as thou hast walked before me.
c87528	Now
c87529	then, O LORD God of Israel,
c87530	let thy word be verified,
c87531	which thou hast spoken unto thy servant David.
c87532	But will God in very deed dwell with men on the earth?
c87533	behold, heaven and the heaven of heavens cannot contain
c87534	thee; how much less this house
c87535	which I have built!
c87536	Have respect therefore to the prayer of thy servant, and to his supplication,
c87537	O LORD my God,
c87538	to hearken unto the cry and the prayer
c87539	which thy servant prayeth before thee:
c87540	That thine eyes may be open upon this house day and night,
c87541	upon the place
c87542	whereof thou hast said
c87543	that thou wouldest put thy name there;
c87544	to hearken unto the prayer
c87545	which thy servant prayeth toward this place.
c87546	Hearken therefore unto the supplications of thy servant, and of thy people Israel,
c87547	which they shall make toward this place:
c87548	hear thou from thy dwelling place, <i>even</i> from heaven;
c87549	and when thou hearest,
c87550	forgive.
c87551	If a man sin against his neighbour,
c87552	be laid upon him to make him swear,
c87553	and an oath
c87554	and the oath come before thine altar in this house;
c87555	Then hear thou from heaven,
c87556	and do,
c87557	and judge thy servants,
c87558	by requiting the wicked,
c87559	by recompensing his way upon his own head;
c87560	and by justifying the righteous,
c87561	by giving him according to his righteousness.
c87562	And if thy people Israel be put to the worse before the enemy,
c87563	because they have sinned
c87564	against thee; and shall return
c87565	and confess thy name,
c87566	and pray
c87567	and make supplication before thee in this house;
c87568	Then hear thou from the heavens,
c87569	and forgive the sin of thy people Israel,
c87570	and bring them again unto the land
c87571	which thou gavest to them and to their fathers.
c87572	When the heaven is shut up,
c87573	and there is no rain,
c87574	because they have sinned
c87575	against thee; <i>yet</i> if they pray toward this place,
c87576	and confess thy name,
c87577	and turn from their sin,
c87578	when thou dost afflict them;
c87579	Then hear thou from heaven,
c87580	and forgive the sin of thy servants, and of thy people Israel,
c87581	when thou hast taught them the good way,
c87582	wherein they should walk;
c87583	and send rain upon thy land,
c87584	which thou hast given unto thy people for an inheritance.
c87586	If there be dearth in the land,
c87587	pestilence,
c87588	if there be
c87589	blasting, or mildew, locusts, or caterpillers;
c87590	if there be
c87591	if their enemies besiege them in the cities of their land;
c87592	whatsoever sore or whatsoever sickness <i>there be:</i>
c87593	<i>Then</i> what prayer <i>or</i> what supplication
c87594	soever shall be made of any man, or of all thy people Israel,
c87595	when every one shall know
c87596	his own sore and his own grief,
c87597	and shall spread forth his hands in this house:
c87598	Then hear thou from heaven thy dwelling place,
c87599	and forgive,
c87600	and render unto every man according unto all his ways,
c87601	whose heart thou knowest;
c87602	(for thou only knowest the hearts of the children of men:)
c87603	That they may fear
c87604	thee, to walk in thy ways, so long
c87605	as they live in the land
c87606	which thou gavest unto our fathers.
c87607	Moreover concerning the stranger,
c87608	which is not of thy people Israel,
c87609	but is come from a far country for thy great name's sake, and thy mighty hand, and thy stretched out arm;
c87610	if they come
c87611	and pray in this house;
c87612	Then hear thou from the heavens, <i>even</i> from thy dwelling place,
c87613	and do according to all
c87614	that the stranger calleth to
c87615	thee for; that all people of the earth may know thy name,
c87616	and fear thee, as <i>doth</i> thy people Israel,
c87617	and may know
c87618	that this house which I have built is called by thy name.
c87620	If thy people go out to war against their enemies by the way
c87621	that thou shalt send
c87622	them, and they pray unto thee toward this city
c87623	which thou hast chosen,
c87624	and the house
c87625	which I have built for thy name;
c87626	Then hear thou from the heavens their prayer and their supplication,
c87627	and maintain their cause.
c87628	If they sin
c87629	against thee, (for <i>there is</i> no man
c87630	which sinneth not,)
c87631	and thou be angry
c87632	with them, and deliver them over before <i>their</i> enemies,
c87633	and they carry them away captives unto a land far off or near;
c87634	Yet <i>if</i> they bethink themselves in the land
c87635	whither they are carried captive,
c87636	and turn
c87637	and pray unto thee in the land of their captivity,
c87638	saying,
c87639	We have sinned,
c87640	we have done amiss,
c87641	and have dealt wickedly;
c87642	If they return to thee with all their heart and with all their soul in the land of their captivity,
c87643	whither they have carried them captives,
c87644	and pray toward their land,
c87645	which thou gavest unto their fathers,
c87646	and <i>toward</i> the city
c87647	which thou hast chosen,
c87648	and toward the house
c87649	which I have built for thy name:
c87650	Then hear thou from the heavens, <i>even</i> from thy dwelling place, their prayer and their supplications,
c87651	and maintain their cause,
c87652	and forgive thy people
c87653	which have sinned against thee.
c87654	Now,
c87655	my God,
c87656	let, I beseech thee, thine eyes be open,
c87657	and <i>let</i> thine ears <i>be</i> attent unto the prayer <i>that is made</i> in this place.
c87658	Now
c87659	therefore arise,
c87660	O LORD God,
c87661	into thy resting place,
c87662	thou, and the ark of thy strength:
c87663	let thy priests,
c87664	O LORD God,
c87665	be clothed with salvation,
c87666	and let thy saints rejoice in goodness.
c87667	O LORD God,
c87668	turn not away the face of thine anointed:
c87669	remember the mercies of David thy servant.
c87670	Now when Solomon had made an end
c87671	of praying,
c87672	the fire came down from heaven,
c87673	and consumed the burnt offering and the sacrifices;
c87674	and the glory of the LORD filled the house.
c87675	And the priests could not
c87676	enter into the house of the LORD,
c87677	because the glory of the LORD had filled the LORD'S house.
c87678	And when all the children of Israel saw
c87679	how the fire came down, and the glory of the LORD upon the house,
c87680	they bowed
c87681	themselves with their faces to the ground
c87682	upon the pavement,
c87683	and worshipped,
c87684	and praised the LORD,
c87685	<i>saying,</i> For <i>he is</i> good;
c87686	for his mercy <i>endureth</i> for ever.
c87687	Then the king and all the people offered sacrifices before the LORD.
c87688	And king Solomon offered a sacrifice of twenty and two thousand oxen, and an hundred and twenty thousand sheep:
c87689	so the king and all the people dedicated the house of God.
c87690	And the priests waited on their offices:
c87691	the Levites also with instruments of musick of the LORD,
c87692	which David the king had made
c87693	to praise the LORD,
c87694	because his mercy <i>endureth</i> for ever,
c87695	when David praised by their ministry;
c87696	and the priests sounded trumpets before
c87697	them, and all Israel stood.
c87698	Moreover Solomon hallowed the middle of the court
c87699	that <i>was</i> before the house of the LORD:
c87700	for there he offered burnt offerings, and the fat of the peace offerings,
c87701	because the brasen altar
c87702	which Solomon had made
c87703	was not able
c87704	to receive the burnt offerings, and the meat offerings, and the fat.
c87705	Also at the same time Solomon kept the feast seven days,
c87706	and all Israel with him, a very great congregation,
c87707	from the entering in of Hamath
c87708	unto the river of Egypt.
c87709	And in the eighth day they made a solemn assembly:
c87710	for they kept the dedication of the altar seven days,
c87711	and the feast seven days.
c87712	And on the three and twentieth day of the seventh month he sent the people away into their tents, glad and merry in heart for the goodness
c87713	that the LORD had shewed unto David, and to Solomon, and to Israel his people.
c87714	Thus Solomon finished the house of the LORD, and the king's house:
c87715	and all
c87716	that came into Solomon's heart
c87717	to make in the house of the LORD, and in his own house,
c87718	he prosperously effected.
c87719	And the LORD appeared to Solomon by night,
c87720	and said
c87721	unto him, I have heard thy prayer,
c87722	and have chosen this place to myself for an house of sacrifice.
c87723	If I shut up heaven
c87724	that there be no rain,
c87725	or if I command the locusts
c87726	to devour the land,
c87727	or if I send pestilence among my people;
c87728	If my people, which are called by my name, shall humble themselves,
c87730	and pray,
c87731	and seek my face,
c87732	and turn from their wicked ways;
c87733	then will I hear from heaven,
c87734	and will forgive their sin,
c87735	and will heal their land.
c87736	Now mine eyes shall be open,
c87737	and mine ears attent unto the prayer <i>that is made</i> in this place.
c87738	For now
c87739	have I chosen
c87740	and sanctified this house,
c87741	that my name may be there for ever:
c87742	and mine eyes and mine heart shall be there perpetually.
c87743	And as for thee,
c87744	if thou wilt walk before
c87745	me, as David thy father walked,
c87746	and do according to all
c87747	that I have commanded
c87748	thee, and shalt observe my statutes and my judgments;
c87749	Then will I stablish the throne of thy kingdom,
c87750	according as I have covenanted with David thy father,
c87751	saying,
c87752	There shall not fail thee a man
c87753	<i>to be</i> ruler in Israel.
c87754	But if ye turn away,
c87755	and forsake my statutes and my commandments,
c87756	which I have set before
c87757	you, and shall go
c87758	and serve other gods,
c87759	and worship them;
c87760	Then will I pluck them up by the roots out of my land
c87761	which I have given
c87762	them; and this house,
c87763	which I have sanctified for my name,
c87764	will I cast out of my sight,
c87765	and will make it <i>to be</i> a proverb and a byword among all nations.
c87766	And this house,
c87767	which is high, shall be an astonishment to every one
c87768	that passeth by
c87770	it; so that he shall say,
c87771	Why hath the LORD done thus unto this land, and unto this house?
c87772	And it shall be answered,
c87773	Because they forsook the LORD God of their fathers,
c87774	which brought them forth out of the land of Egypt,
c87775	and laid hold on other gods,
c87776	and worshipped
c87777	them, and served
c87778	them: therefore hath he brought all this evil upon them.
c87779	And it came to pass at the end of twenty years,
c87780	wherein Solomon had built the house of the LORD, and his own house,
c87781	That the cities
c87782	which Huram had restored to Solomon,
c87783	Solomon built
c87784	them, and caused the children of Israel to dwell there.
c87785	And Solomon went to Hamathzobah,
c87786	and prevailed against it.
c87787	And he built Tadmor in the wilderness,
c87788	and all the store cities,
c87789	which he built in Hamath.
c87790	Also he built Bethhoron the upper, and Bethhoron the nether, fenced cities, with walls, gates, and bars;
c87791	And Baalath, and all the store cities
c87792	that Solomon had,
c87793	and all the chariot cities, and the cities of the horsemen, and all that Solomon desired
c87795	to build in Jerusalem, and in Lebanon, and throughout all the land of his dominion.
c87796	<i>As for</i> all the people
c87797	<i>that were</i> left of the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites,
c87798	which <i>were</i> not of Israel,
c87799	<i>But</i> of their children,
c87800	who were left after them in the land,
c87801	whom the children of Israel consumed not,
c87802	them did Solomon make to pay tribute until this day.
c87803	But of the children of Israel
c87804	did Solomon make no servants for his work;
c87805	but they <i>were</i> men of war, and chief of his captains, and captains of his chariots and horsemen.
c87806	And these <i>were</i> the chief of king Solomon's officers,
c87808	<i>even</i> two hundred and fifty,
c87809	that bare rule over the people.
c87810	And Solomon brought up the daughter of Pharaoh out of the city of David unto the house
c87811	that he had built
c87812	for her: for he said,
c87813	My wife shall not dwell in the house of David king of Israel,
c87814	because <i>the places are</i> holy,
c87815	whereunto the ark of the LORD hath come.
c87816	Then Solomon offered burnt offerings unto the LORD on the altar of the LORD,
c87817	which he had built before the porch,
c87818	Even after a certain rate every day,
c87819	offering according to the commandment of Moses,
c87820	on the sabbaths, and on the new moons, and on the solemn feasts, three times in the year, <i>even</i> in the feast of unleavened bread, and in the feast of weeks, and in the feast of tabernacles.
c87821	And he appointed, according to the order of David his father, the courses of the priests to their service,
c87822	and the Levites to their charges,
c87823	to praise
c87824	and minister before the priests, as the duty of every day required:
c87825	the porters also by their courses at every gate:
c87826	for so had David the man of God commanded.
c87827	And they departed not from the commandment of the king unto the priests and Levites concerning any matter, or concerning the treasures.
c87828	Now all the work of Solomon was prepared unto the day of the foundation of the house of the LORD,
c87829	and until it was finished.
c87830	<i>So</i> the house of the LORD was perfected.
c87831	Then went Solomon to Eziongeber, and to Eloth, at the sea side in the land of Edom.
c87832	And Huram sent him by the hands of his servants ships, and servants
c87833	that had knowledge of the sea;
c87834	and they went with the servants of Solomon to Ophir,
c87835	and took thence four hundred and fifty talents of gold,
c87836	and brought <i>them</i> to king Solomon.
c87837	And when the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon,
c87838	she came
c87839	to prove Solomon with hard questions
c87840	at Jerusalem, with a very great company, and camels
c87841	that bare spices, and gold in abundance, and precious stones:
c87842	and when she was come to Solomon,
c87843	she communed with him of all
c87844	that was in her heart.
c87845	And Solomon told her all her questions:
c87846	and there was nothing hid from Solomon
c87847	which he told her not.
c87848	And when the queen of Sheba had seen the wisdom of Solomon, and the house
c87849	that he had built,
c87850	And the meat of his table, and the sitting of his servants, and the attendance of his ministers, and their apparel; his cupbearers also, and their apparel; and his ascent
c87851	by which he went up into the house of the LORD;
c87852	there was no more spirit in her.
c87853	And she said to the king,
c87854	<i>It was</i> a true report
c87855	which I heard in mine own land of thine acts, and of thy wisdom:
c87856	Howbeit I believed not their words,
c87857	until I came,
c87858	and mine eyes had seen
c87859	<i>it:</i> and, behold,
c87860	the one half of the greatness of thy wisdom was not told
c87861	me: <i>for</i> thou exceedest the fame
c87862	that I heard.
c87863	Happy <i>are</i> thy men,
c87864	and happy <i>are</i> these thy servants,
c87865	which stand continually before
c87866	thee, and hear thy wisdom.
c87867	Blessed be the LORD thy God,
c87868	which delighted
c87869	in thee to set thee on his throne, <i>to be</i> king for the LORD thy God:
c87870	because thy God loved Israel,
c87871	to establish them for ever,
c87872	therefore made he thee king over
c87873	them, to do judgment and justice.
c87874	And she gave the king an hundred and twenty talents of gold, and of spices great abundance, and precious stones:
c87875	neither was there any such spice
c87876	as the queen of Sheba gave king Solomon.
c87877	And the servants also of Huram, and the servants of Solomon,
c87878	which brought gold from Ophir,
c87879	brought algum trees and precious stones.
c87880	And the king made <i>of</i> the algum trees terraces to the house of the LORD, and to the king's palace,
c87881	and harps and psalteries for singers:
c87882	and there were none such seen before in the land of Judah.
c87883	And king Solomon gave to the queen of Sheba all her desire,
c87884	whatsoever she asked,
c87885	beside <i>that</i> which she had brought unto the king.
c87886	So she turned,
c87887	and went away to her own land, she and her servants.
c87888	was
c87889	Now the weight of gold
c87890	that came to Solomon in one year
c87891	six hundred and threescore and six talents of gold;
c87892	Beside <i>that which</i> chapmen and merchants brought.
c87893	And all the kings of Arabia and governors of the country brought gold and silver to Solomon.
c87894	And king Solomon made two hundred targets <i>of</i> beaten gold:
c87895	six hundred <i>shekels</i> of beaten gold went to one target.
c87896	And three hundred shields <i>made he of</i> beaten gold:
c87897	three hundred <i>shekels</i> of gold went to one shield.
c87898	And the king put them in the house of the forest of Lebanon.
c87899	Moreover the king made a great throne of ivory,
c87900	and overlaid it with pure gold.
c87901	And <i>there were</i> six steps to the throne,
c87902	with a footstool of gold, <i>which were</i> fastened to the throne,
c87903	and stays on each side of the sitting place,
c87904	and two lions standing by the stays:
c87905	And twelve lions stood there on the one side and on the other upon the six steps.
c87906	There was not the like made in any kingdom.
c87907	And all the drinking vessels of king Solomon <i>were of</i> gold,
c87908	and all the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon <i>were of</i> pure gold:
c87909	none <i>were of</i> silver; it was <i>not</i> any thing accounted of in the days of Solomon.
c87910	For the king's ships went to Tarshish with the servants of Huram:
c87911	every three years once came the ships of Tarshish
c87912	bringing gold, and silver, ivory, and apes, and peacocks.
c87913	And king Solomon passed all the kings of the earth in riches and wisdom.
c87914	And all the kings of the earth sought the presence of Solomon,
c87915	to hear his wisdom,
c87916	that God had put in his heart.
c87917	And they brought
c87918	every man his present,
c87919	vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and raiment, harness, and spices, horses, and mules, a rate year by year.
c87920	And Solomon had four thousand stalls for horses and chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen;
c87921	whom he bestowed in the chariot cities,
c87922	and with the king at Jerusalem.
c87923	And he reigned over all the kings from the river even unto the land of the Philistines, and to the border of Egypt.
c87924	And the king made silver in Jerusalem as stones,
c87925	and cedar trees made he as the sycomore trees
c87926	that <i>are</i> in the low plains in abundance.
c87927	And they brought unto Solomon horses out of Egypt,
c87928	and out of all lands.
c87929	Now the rest of the acts of Solomon, first and last,
c87930	<i>are</i> they not written in the book of Nathan the prophet, and in the prophecy of Ahijah the Shilonite, and in the visions of Iddo the seer against Jeroboam the son of Nebat?
c87931	And Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel forty years.
c87932	And Solomon slept with his fathers,
c87933	and he was buried in the city of David his father:
c87934	and Rehoboam his son reigned in his stead.
c87935	And Rehoboam went to Shechem:
c87936	for to Shechem were all Israel come
c87937	to make him king.
c87938	And it came to pass,
c87939	when Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who <i>was</i> in Egypt,
c87941	whither he had fled from the presence of Solomon the king, heard
c87942	<i>it,</i> that Jeroboam returned out of Egypt.
c87943	And they sent
c87944	and called
c87945	him. So Jeroboam and all Israel came
c87946	and spake to Rehoboam,
c87947	saying,
c87948	Thy father made our yoke grievous:
c87949	now
c87950	therefore ease thou somewhat the grievous servitude of thy father, and his heavy yoke
c87951	that he put upon
c87952	us, and we will serve thee.
c87953	And he said unto
c87954	me after three days.
c87955	them, Come again unto
c87956	And the people departed.
c87957	And king Rehoboam took counsel with the old men
c87958	that had stood before Solomon his father
c87959	while he yet lived,
c87960	saying,
c87961	What counsel give ye
c87962	<i>me</i> to return answer to this people?
c87963	And they spake unto
c87964	him, saying,
c87965	If thou be kind to this people,
c87966	and please
c87967	them, and speak good words to
c87968	them, they will be thy servants for ever.
c87969	But he forsook the counsel which the old men
c87970	gave
c87971	him, and took counsel with the young men
c87972	that were brought up with
c87973	him, that stood before him.
c87974	And he said unto
c87975	them, What advice give ye
c87976	that we may return answer to this people,
c87977	which have spoken to
c87978	me, saying,
c87979	Ease somewhat the yoke
c87980	that thy father did put upon us?
c87981	And the young men that were brought up with him spake
c87982	unto
c87983	him, saying,
c87984	Thus shalt thou answer the people
c87985	that spake unto
c87986	thee, saying,
c87987	Thy father made our yoke heavy,
c87988	but make thou <i>it</i> somewhat lighter for
c87989	us; thus shalt thou say unto
c87990	them, My little <i>finger</i> shall be thicker than my father's loins.
c87991	For whereas
c87992	my father put a heavy yoke upon
c87993	you, I will put more to your yoke:
c87994	my father chastised you with whips,
c87995	but I <i>will chastise you</i> with scorpions.
c87996	So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam on the third day,
c87997	as the king bade,
c87998	saying,
c87999	Come again to me on the third day.
c88000	And the king answered them roughly;
c88001	and king Rehoboam forsook the counsel of the old men,
c88002	And answered them after the advice of the young men,
c88003	saying,
c88004	My father made your yoke heavy,
c88005	but I will add thereto:
c88006	my father chastised you with whips,
c88007	but I <i>will chastise you</i> with scorpions.
c88008	So the king hearkened not unto the people:
c88009	for the cause was of God,
c88010	that the LORD might perform his word,
c88011	which he spake by the hand of Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam the son of Nebat.
c88012	And when all Israel
c88013	<i>saw</i> that the king would not hearken
c88014	unto them, the people answered the king,
c88015	saying,
c88016	What portion have we in David?
c88017	and <i>we have</i> none inheritance in the son of Jesse:
c88018	every man to your tents,
c88019	O Israel:
c88020	<i>and</i> now, David, see to thine own house.
c88022	So all Israel went to their tents.
c88023	But <i>as for</i> the children of Israel
c88024	that dwelt in the cities of Judah,
c88025	Rehoboam reigned over them.
c88026	Then king Rehoboam sent Hadoram
c88027	that <i>was</i> over the tribute;
c88028	and the children of Israel stoned him with stones,
c88029	that he died.
c88030	But king Rehoboam made speed
c88031	to get him up to <i>his</i> chariot,
c88032	to flee to Jerusalem.
c88033	And Israel rebelled against the house of David unto this day.
c88034	And when Rehoboam was come to Jerusalem,
c88035	he gathered of the house of Judah and Benjamin
c88036	an hundred and fourscore thousand chosen
c88037	<i>men,</i> which were warriors,
c88038	to fight against Israel,
c88039	that he might bring the kingdom again to Rehoboam.
c88040	But the word of the LORD came to Shemaiah the man of God,
c88041	saying,
c88042	Speak unto Rehoboam the son of Solomon, king of Judah, and to all Israel in Judah and Benjamin,
c88043	saying,
c88044	Thus saith the LORD,
c88045	Ye shall not go up,
c88046	nor fight against your brethren:
c88047	return
c88048	every man to his house:
c88049	for this thing is done of
c88050	me. And they obeyed the words of the LORD,
c88051	and returned
c88052	from going against Jeroboam.
c88053	And Rehoboam dwelt in Jerusalem,
c88054	and built cities for defence in Judah.
c88055	He built even Bethlehem, and Etam, and Tekoa,
c88056	And Bethzur, and Shoco, and Adullam,
c88057	And Gath, and Mareshah, and Ziph,
c88058	And Adoraim, and Lachish, and Azekah,
c88059	And Zorah, and Aijalon, and Hebron,
c88060	which <i>are</i> in Judah and in Benjamin
c88061	fenced cities.
c88062	And he fortified the strong holds,
c88063	and put captains in them, and store of victual, and of oil and wine.
c88064	And in every several city <i>he put</i> shields and spears,
c88065	and made them exceeding strong,
c88067	having Judah and Benjamin on his side.
c88068	And the priests and the Levites
c88069	that <i>were</i> in all Israel
c88070	resorted to him out of all their coasts.
c88071	For the Levites left their suburbs and their possession,
c88072	and came to Judah and Jerusalem:
c88073	for Jeroboam and his sons had cast them off
c88074	from executing the priest's office unto the LORD:
c88075	And he ordained him priests for the high places, and for the devils, and for the calves
c88076	which he had made.
c88077	And after them out of all the tribes of Israel
c88078	such as set their hearts
c88079	to seek the LORD God of Israel
c88080	came to Jerusalem,
c88081	to sacrifice unto the LORD God of their fathers.
c88082	So they strengthened the kingdom of Judah,
c88083	and made Rehoboam the son of Solomon strong, three years:
c88084	for three years they walked in the way of David and Solomon.
c88085	And Rehoboam took him Mahalath the daughter of Jerimoth the son of David to wife, <i>and</i> Abihail the daughter of Eliab the son of Jesse;
c88086	Which bare him children; Jeush, and Shamariah, and Zaham.
c88087	And after her he took Maachah the daughter of Absalom;
c88088	which bare him Abijah, and Attai, and Ziza, and Shelomith.
c88089	And Rehoboam loved Maachah the daughter of Absalom above all his wives and his concubines:
c88090	(for he took eighteen wives,
c88091	and threescore concubines;
c88092	and begat twenty and eight sons, and threescore daughters.)
c88093	And Rehoboam made Abijah the son of Maachah the chief, <i>to be</i> ruler among his brethren:
c88094	for <i>he thought</i> to make him king.
c88095	And he dealt wisely,
c88096	and dispersed of all his children throughout all the countries of Judah and Benjamin, unto every fenced city:
c88097	and he gave them victual in abundance.
c88098	And he desired many wives.
c88099	And it came to pass,
c88100	when Rehoboam had established the kingdom,
c88101	and had strengthened
c88102	himself, he forsook the law of the LORD,
c88103	and all Israel with him.
c88104	And it came to pass, <i>that</i> in the fifth year of king Rehoboam
c88105	Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem,
c88106	because they had transgressed against the LORD,
c88107	With twelve hundred chariots, and threescore thousand horsemen:
c88108	and the people <i>were</i> without number
c88109	that came with him out of Egypt;
c88110	the Lubims, the Sukkiims, and the Ethiopians.
c88111	And he took the fenced cities
c88112	which <i>pertained</i> to Judah,
c88113	and came to Jerusalem.
c88114	Then came Shemaiah the prophet to Rehoboam, and <i>to</i> the princes of Judah,
c88115	that were gathered together to Jerusalem because of Shishak,
c88116	and said
c88117	unto them, Thus saith the LORD,
c88118	Ye have forsaken
c88119	me, and therefore have I also left you in the hand of Shishak.
c88120	Whereupon the princes of Israel and the king humbled themselves;
c88121	and they said,
c88122	The LORD <i>is</i> righteous.
c88124	And when the LORD saw
c88125	that they humbled themselves,
c88126	the word of the LORD came to Shemaiah,
c88127	saying,
c88128	They have humbled themselves;
c88129	<i>therefore</i> I will not destroy
c88130	them, but I will grant them some deliverance;
c88131	and my wrath shall not be poured out upon Jerusalem by the hand of Shishak.
c88132	Nevertheless they shall be his servants;
c88133	that they may know my service, and the service of the kingdoms of the countries.
c88134	So Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem,
c88135	and took away the treasures of the house of the LORD, and the treasures of the king's house;
c88136	he took all:
c88137	he carried away also the shields of gold
c88138	which Solomon had made.
c88139	Instead of which king Rehoboam made shields of brass,
c88140	and committed <i>them</i> to the hands of the chief of the guard,
c88141	that kept the entrance of the king's house.
c88143	And when the king entered into the house of the LORD,
c88144	the guard came
c88145	and fetched
c88146	them, and brought them again into the guard chamber.
c88148	And when he humbled himself,
c88149	the wrath of the LORD turned from
c88150	him, that he would not
c88151	destroy <i>him</i> altogether:
c88152	and also in Judah things went well.
c88153	So king Rehoboam strengthened himself in Jerusalem,
c88154	and reigned:
c88155	for Rehoboam <i>was</i> one and forty years old
c88156	when he began to reign,
c88157	and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city
c88158	which the LORD had chosen
c88159	to put his name there.
c88160	out of all the tribes of Israel,
c88161	And his mother's name <i>was</i> Naamah an Ammonitess.
c88162	And he did evil,
c88163	because he prepared not his heart
c88164	to seek the LORD.
c88165	Now the acts of Rehoboam, first and last,
c88166	<i>are</i> they not written in the book of Shemaiah the prophet, and of Iddo the seer
c88167	concerning genealogies?
c88168	And <i>there were</i> wars between Rehoboam and Jeroboam continually.
c88169	And Rehoboam slept with his fathers,
c88170	and was buried in the city of David:
c88171	and Abijah his son reigned in his stead.
c88172	Now in the eighteenth year of king Jeroboam
c88173	began Abijah to reign over Judah.
c88174	He reigned three years in Jerusalem.
c88175	His mother's name also <i>was</i> Michaiah the daughter of Uriel of Gibeah.
c88176	And there was war between Abijah and Jeroboam.
c88177	And Abijah set the battle in array with an army of valiant men of war, <i>even</i> four hundred thousand chosen men:
c88178	Jeroboam also set the battle in array against him with eight hundred thousand chosen men, <i>being</i> mighty men of valour.
c88179	And Abijah stood up upon mount Zemaraim,
c88180	which <i>is</i> in mount Ephraim,
c88181	and said,
c88182	Hear
c88183	me, thou Jeroboam, and all Israel;
c88184	Ought ye not
c88185	to know
c88186	that the LORD God of Israel gave the kingdom over Israel to David for ever,
c88187	<i>even</i> to him and to his sons by a covenant of salt?
c88188	Yet Jeroboam the son of Nebat, the servant of Solomon the son of David, is risen up,
c88189	and hath rebelled against his lord.
c88190	And there are gathered unto him vain men, the children of Belial,
c88191	and have strengthened themselves against Rehoboam the son of Solomon,
c88192	when Rehoboam was young and tenderhearted,
c88193	and could not withstand them.
c88194	And now
c88195	ye think
c88196	to withstand the kingdom of the LORD in the hand of the sons of David;
c88197	and ye <i>be</i> a great multitude,
c88198	and <i>there are</i> with you golden calves,
c88199	which Jeroboam made you for gods.
c88200	Have ye not cast out the priests of the LORD, the sons of Aaron, and the Levites,
c88201	and have made you priests after the manner of the nations of <i>other</i> lands?
c88202	so that whosoever
c88203	cometh
c88204	to consecrate himself with a young bullock and seven rams,
c88205	<i>the same</i> may be a priest of <i>them that are</i> no gods.
c88206	But as for us,
c88207	the LORD <i>is</i> our God,
c88208	and we have not forsaken
c88209	him; and the priests,
c88210	which minister unto the LORD,
c88211	<i>are</i> the sons of Aaron,
c88212	and the Levites <i>wait</i> upon <i>their</i> business:
c88213	And they burn unto the LORD every morning and every evening burnt sacrifices
c88214	and sweet incense: the shewbread also <i>set they in order</i> upon the pure table;
c88215	and the candlestick of gold with the lamps
c88216	thereof, to burn every evening:
c88217	for we keep the charge of the LORD our God;
c88218	but ye have forsaken him.
c88219	And, behold,
c88220	God himself <i>is</i> with us for <i>our</i> captain,
c88221	and his priests with sounding trumpets
c88222	to cry alarm against
c88223	you. O children of Israel,
c88224	fight ye not against the LORD God of your fathers;
c88225	for ye shall not prosper.
c88226	But Jeroboam caused an ambushment
c88227	to come about behind
c88228	them: so they were before Judah,
c88229	and the ambushment <i>was</i> behind them.
c88230	And when Judah looked back,
c88231	behold,
c88232	the battle <i>was</i> before and behind:
c88233	and they cried unto the LORD,
c88234	and the priests sounded with the trumpets.
c88235	Then the men of Judah gave a shout:
c88236	it came to pass,
c88237	and as the men of Judah shouted,
c88238	that God smote Jeroboam and all Israel before Abijah and Judah.
c88239	And the children of Israel fled before Judah:
c88240	and God delivered them into their hand.
c88241	And Abijah and his people slew them with a great slaughter:
c88242	so there fell down slain of Israel five hundred thousand chosen men.
c88243	Thus the children of Israel were brought under at that time,
c88244	and the children of Judah prevailed,
c88245	because they relied upon the LORD God of their fathers.
c88246	And Abijah pursued after Jeroboam,
c88247	and took cities from him, Bethel with the towns thereof, and Jeshanah with the towns thereof, and Ephrain with the towns thereof.
c88248	Neither did Jeroboam recover strength again in the days of Abijah:
c88249	and the LORD struck
c88250	him, and he died.
c88251	But Abijah waxed mighty,
c88252	and married fourteen wives,
c88253	and begat twenty and two sons, and sixteen daughters.
c88254	And the rest of the acts of Abijah, and his ways, and his sayings, <i>are</i> written in the story of the prophet Iddo.
c88255	So Abijah slept with his fathers,
c88256	and they buried him in the city of David:
c88257	and Asa his son reigned in his stead.
c88258	In his days the land was quiet ten years.
c88259	And Asa did
c88260	<i>that which was</i> good
c88261	and right in the eyes of the LORD his God:
c88262	For he took away the altars of the strange <i>gods,</i> and the high places,
c88263	and brake down the images,
c88264	and cut down the groves:
c88265	And commanded Judah
c88266	to seek the LORD God of their fathers,
c88267	and to do the law and the commandment.
c88268	Also he took away out of all the cities of Judah the high places and the images:
c88269	and the kingdom was quiet before him.
c88270	And he built fenced cities in Judah:
c88271	for the land had rest,
c88272	and he had no war in those years;
c88273	because the LORD had given him rest.
c88274	Therefore he said unto Judah,
c88275	Let us build these cities,
c88276	and make about <i>them</i> walls, and towers, gates, and bars,
c88278	<i>while</i> the land <i>is</i> yet before
c88279	us; because we have sought the LORD our God,
c88280	we have sought
c88281	<i>him,</i> and he hath given us rest on every side.
c88282	So they built
c88283	and prospered.
c88284	And Asa had an army
c88285	<i>of men</i> that bare targets and spears,
c88286	out of Judah three hundred thousand;
c88287	and out of Benjamin, that bare shields and drew bows, two hundred and fourscore thousand:
c88288	all these <i>were</i> mighty men of valour.
c88289	And there came out against them Zerah the Ethiopian with an host of a thousand thousand, and three hundred chariots;
c88290	and came unto Mareshah.
c88291	Then Asa went out against
c88292	him, and they set the battle in array in the valley of Zephathah at Mareshah.
c88293	And Asa cried unto the LORD his God,
c88294	and said,
c88295	LORD,
c88296	<i>it is</i> nothing with
c88297	thee to help, whether with many, or with them that have no power:
c88298	help
c88299	us, O LORD our God;
c88300	for we rest on
c88301	thee, and in thy name we go against this multitude.
c88302	O LORD,
c88303	thou <i>art</i> our God;
c88304	let not man prevail against thee.
c88305	So the LORD smote the Ethiopians before Asa, and before Judah;
c88306	and the Ethiopians fled.
c88307	And Asa and the people that <i>were</i> with him pursued
c88309	them unto Gerar:
c88310	and the Ethiopians were overthrown,
c88311	that they could not recover
c88312	themselves; for they were destroyed before the LORD, and before his host;
c88313	and they carried away very much spoil.
c88314	And they smote all the cities round about Gerar;
c88315	for the fear of the LORD came upon
c88316	them: and they spoiled all the cities;
c88317	for there was exceeding much spoil in them.
c88318	They smote also the tents of cattle,
c88319	and carried away sheep and camels in abundance,
c88320	and returned to Jerusalem.
c88321	Azariah the son of Oded:
c88322	And the Spirit of God came upon
c88323	And he went out to meet Asa,
c88324	and said
c88325	unto him, Hear
c88326	ye me, Asa, and all Judah and Benjamin;
c88327	The LORD <i>is</i> with
c88328	you, while ye be with
c88329	him; and if ye seek
c88330	him, he will be found
c88331	of you; but if ye forsake
c88332	him, he will forsake you.
c88333	Now for a long season Israel <i>hath been</i> without the true God, and without a teaching priest, and without law.
c88334	did turn
c88335	But when they in their trouble
c88336	unto the LORD God of Israel,
c88337	and sought
c88338	him, he was found of them.
c88339	And in those times <i>there was</i> no peace to him that went out, nor to him that came in,
c88340	but great vexations <i>were</i> upon all the inhabitants of the countries.
c88342	And nation was destroyed of nation,
c88343	and city of city:
c88344	for God did vex them with all adversity.
c88345	Be ye strong
c88346	therefore, and let not your hands be weak:
c88347	for your work shall be rewarded.
c88349	And when Asa heard these words, and the prophecy of Oded the prophet,
c88350	he took courage,
c88351	and put away the abominable idols out of all the land of Judah and Benjamin, and out of the cities
c88352	which he had taken from mount Ephraim,
c88353	and renewed the altar of the LORD,
c88354	that <i>was</i> before the porch of the LORD.
c88355	And he gathered all Judah and Benjamin, and the strangers with them out of Ephraim and Manasseh, and out of Simeon:
c88356	for they fell to him out of Israel in abundance,
c88357	when they saw
c88358	that the LORD his God <i>was</i> with him.
c88359	So they gathered themselves together at Jerusalem in the third month, in the fifteenth year of the reign of Asa.
c88360	And they offered unto the LORD the same time, of the spoil
c88361	<i>which</i> they had brought,
c88362	seven hundred oxen and seven thousand sheep.
c88363	And they entered into a covenant
c88364	to seek the LORD God of their fathers with all their heart and with all their soul;
c88365	That whosoever
c88366	would not seek the LORD God of Israel
c88367	should be put to death, whether small or great, whether man or woman.
c88368	And they sware unto the LORD with a loud voice, and with shouting, and with trumpets, and with cornets.
c88369	And all Judah rejoiced at the oath:
c88370	for they had sworn with all their heart,
c88371	and sought him with their whole desire;
c88372	and he was found
c88373	of them: and the LORD gave them rest round about.
c88374	And also <i>concerning</i> Maachah the mother of Asa the king,
c88375	he removed her from <i>being</i> queen,
c88376	because she had made an idol in a grove:
c88377	and Asa cut down her idol,
c88378	and stamped
c88379	<i>it,</i> and burnt <i>it</i> at the brook Kidron.
c88380	But the high places were not taken away out of Israel:
c88381	nevertheless the heart of Asa was perfect all his days.
c88382	And he brought into the house of God the things that his father had dedicated, and that he himself had dedicated, silver, and gold, and vessels.
c88383	And there was no <i>more</i> war unto the five and thirtieth year of the reign of Asa.
c88384	In the six and thirtieth year of the reign of Asa Baasha king of Israel came up against Judah,
c88385	and built Ramah,
c88386	to the intent that he might let none go out or come in to Asa king of Judah.
c88387	Then Asa brought out silver and gold out of the treasures of the house of the LORD and of the king's house,
c88388	and sent to Benhadad king of Syria,
c88389	that dwelt at Damascus,
c88390	saying,
c88391	<i>There is</i> a league between me and thee, as <i>there was</i> between my father and thy father:
c88392	behold, I have sent thee silver and gold;
c88393	go,
c88394	break thy league with Baasha king of Israel,
c88395	that he may depart from me.
c88396	And Benhadad hearkened unto king Asa,
c88397	and sent the captains of his armies
c88399	against the cities of Israel;
c88400	and they smote Ijon, and Dan, and Abelmaim, and all the store cities of Naphtali.
c88401	And it came to pass,
c88402	when Baasha heard
c88403	<i>it,</i> that he left off
c88404	building of Ramah,
c88405	and let his work cease.
c88406	Then Asa the king took all Judah;
c88407	and they carried away the stones of Ramah, and the timber
c88408	thereof, wherewith Baasha was building;
c88409	and he built therewith Geba and Mizpah.
c88410	And at that time Hanani the seer came to Asa king of Judah,
c88411	and said unto
c88412	him, Because thou hast relied on the king of Syria,
c88413	and not relied on the LORD thy God,
c88414	therefore is the host of the king of Syria escaped out of thine hand.
c88415	Were not the Ethiopians and the Lubims a huge host, with very many chariots and horsemen?
c88418	yet, because thou didst rely on the LORD,
c88419	he delivered them into thine hand.
c88420	For the eyes of the LORD
c88421	run to and fro throughout the whole earth,
c88422	to shew himself strong in the behalf of <i>them</i> whose heart
c88423	<i>is</i> perfect toward
c88424	him. Herein thou hast done foolishly:
c88425	therefore from henceforth thou shalt have wars.
c88426	Then Asa was wroth with the seer,
c88427	and put him in a prison house;
c88428	for <i>he was</i> in a rage with him because of this
c88429	<i>thing.</i> And Asa oppressed <i>some</i> of the people the same time.
c88430	And, behold, the acts of Asa, first and last,
c88431	lo, they <i>are</i> written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.
c88432	And Asa in the thirty and ninth year of his reign was diseased in his feet,
c88433	until his disease <i>was</i> exceeding
c88434	<i>great:</i> yet in his disease he sought not to the LORD,
c88435	but to the physicians.
c88436	And Asa slept with his fathers,
c88437	and died in the one and fortieth year
c88438	of his reign.
c88439	And they buried him in his own sepulchres,
c88440	which he had made for himself in the city of David,
c88441	and laid him in the bed
c88442	which was filled with sweet odours and divers kinds
c88443	<i>of spices</i> prepared by the apothecaries' art:
c88444	and they made a very great burning for him.
c88445	And Jehoshaphat his son reigned in his stead,
c88446	and strengthened himself against Israel.
c88447	And he placed forces in all the fenced cities of Judah,
c88448	and set garrisons in the land of Judah, and in the cities of Ephraim,
c88449	which Asa his father had taken.
c88450	And the LORD was with Jehoshaphat,
c88451	because he walked in the first ways of his father David,
c88452	and sought not unto Baalim;
c88453	But sought to the <i>LORD</i> God of his father,
c88454	and walked in his commandments,
c88455	and not after the doings of Israel.
c88456	Therefore the LORD stablished the kingdom in his hand;
c88457	and all Judah brought to Jehoshaphat presents;
c88458	and he had riches and honour in abundance.
c88459	And his heart was lifted up in the ways of the LORD:
c88460	moreover he took away the high places and groves out of Judah.
c88461	Also in the third year
c88462	of his reign
c88463	he sent to his princes, <i>even</i> to Benhail, and to Obadiah, and to Zechariah, and to Nethaneel, and to Michaiah,
c88464	to teach in the cities of Judah.
c88465	And with them <i>he sent</i> Levites, <i>even</i> Shemaiah, and Nethaniah, and Zebadiah, and Asahel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehonathan, and Adonijah, and Tobijah, and Tobadonijah, Levites;
c88466	and with them Elishama and Jehoram, priests.
c88467	And they taught in Judah,
c88468	and <i>had</i> the book of the law of the LORD with
c88469	them, and went about throughout all the cities of Judah,
c88470	and taught the people.
c88471	And the fear of the LORD fell upon all the kingdoms of the lands
c88472	that <i>were</i> round about Judah,
c88473	so that they made no war against Jehoshaphat.
c88474	Also <i>some</i> of the Philistines brought Jehoshaphat presents, and tribute silver;
c88475	and the Arabians brought him flocks, seven thousand and seven hundred rams, and seven thousand and seven hundred he goats.
c88476	And Jehoshaphat waxed
c88477	great exceedingly;
c88478	and he built in Judah castles, and cities of store.
c88479	And he had much business in the cities of Judah:
c88480	and the men of war, mighty men of valour, <i>were</i> in Jerusalem.
c88481	And these <i>are</i> the numbers of them according to the house of their fathers:
c88482	Of Judah, the captains of thousands;
c88483	Adnah the chief,
c88484	and with him mighty men of valour three hundred thousand.
c88485	And next to him <i>was</i> Jehohanan the captain,
c88486	and with him two hundred and fourscore thousand.
c88487	And next him <i>was</i> Amasiah the son of Zichri,
c88488	who willingly offered himself unto the LORD;
c88489	and with him two hundred thousand mighty men of valour.
c88490	And of Benjamin; Eliada a mighty man of valour,
c88491	and with him armed men with bow and shield two hundred thousand.
c88492	And next him <i>was</i> Jehozabad,
c88493	and with him an hundred and fourscore thousand ready prepared for the war.
c88494	These
c88495	waited on the king,
c88496	beside <i>those</i> whom the king put in the fenced cities throughout all Judah.
c88497	Now Jehoshaphat had riches and honour in abundance,
c88498	and joined affinity with Ahab.
c88499	And after <i>certain</i> years he went down to Ahab to Samaria.
c88500	And Ahab killed sheep and oxen for him in abundance,
c88501	and for the people
c88502	that <i>he had</i> with
c88503	him, and persuaded
c88504	him to go up <i>with him</i> to Ramothgilead.
c88505	And Ahab king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat king of Judah,
c88506	Wilt thou go with me to Ramothgilead?
c88507	And he answered
c88508	him, I <i>am</i> as thou
c88509	<i>art,</i> and my people as thy people;
c88510	and <i>we will be</i> with thee in the war.
c88511	And Jehoshaphat said unto the king of Israel,
c88512	Enquire, I pray thee, at the word of the LORD to day.
c88513	Therefore the king of Israel gathered together of prophets four hundred men,
c88514	and said unto
c88515	them, Shall we go to Ramothgilead to battle,
c88516	or shall I forbear?
c88517	And they said,
c88518	Go up;
c88519	for God will deliver <i>it</i> into the king's hand.
c88520	But Jehoshaphat said,
c88521	<i>Is there</i> not here a prophet of the LORD besides,
c88522	that we might enquire of him?
c88523	And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat,
c88524	<i>There is</i> yet one man,
c88525	by whom we may enquire of the LORD:
c88526	but I hate
c88527	him; for he never prophesied good unto
c88528	me, but always evil:
c88529	the same <i>is</i> Micaiah the son of Imla.
c88530	And Jehoshaphat said,
c88531	Let not the king say so.
c88532	And the king of Israel called for one <i>of his</i> officers,
c88533	and said,
c88534	Fetch quickly Micaiah the son of Imla.
c88535	And the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat king of Judah sat
c88536	either of them on his throne,
c88537	clothed in <i>their</i> robes,
c88538	and they sat in a void place at the entering in of the gate of Samaria;
c88539	and all the prophets prophesied before them.
c88540	And Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah had made him horns of iron,
c88541	and said,
c88542	Thus saith the LORD,
c88543	With these thou shalt push Syria
c88544	until they be consumed.
c88545	And all the prophets prophesied so,
c88546	saying,
c88547	Go up to Ramothgilead,
c88548	and prosper:
c88549	for the LORD shall deliver <i>it</i> into the hand of the king.
c88550	And the messenger
c88551	that went
c88552	to call Micaiah
c88553	spake to
c88554	him, saying,
c88555	Behold, the words of the prophets <i>declare</i> good to the king with one assent;
c88556	let thy word therefore, I pray thee, be like one of
c88557	theirs, and speak thou good.
c88558	And Micaiah said,
c88559	<i>As</i> the LORD liveth,
c88560	even
c88561	what my God saith,
c88562	that will I speak.
c88563	And when he was come to the king,
c88564	the king said unto
c88565	him, Micaiah,
c88566	shall we go to Ramothgilead to battle,
c88567	or shall I forbear?
c88568	And he said,
c88569	Go ye up,
c88570	and prosper,
c88571	and they shall be delivered into your hand.
c88572	And the king said to
c88573	him, How many times shall I adjure
c88574	thee that thou say nothing but the truth to me in the name of the LORD?
c88575	Then he said,
c88576	I did see all Israel
c88577	scattered upon the mountains, as sheep
c88578	that have no shepherd:
c88579	and the LORD said,
c88580	These have no master;
c88581	let them return
c88582	<i>therefore</i> every man to his house
c88583	in peace.
c88584	And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat,
c88585	Did I not tell
c88586	thee <i>that</i> he would not prophesy good unto
c88587	me, but evil?
c88588	Again he said,
c88589	Therefore hear the word of the LORD;
c88590	I saw the LORD
c88591	sitting upon his throne,
c88592	and all the host of heaven standing on his right hand and <i>on</i> his left.
c88593	And the LORD said,
c88594	Who shall entice Ahab king of Israel,
c88595	that he may go up
c88596	and fall at Ramothgilead?
c88598	And one spake saying after this manner,
c88599	and another saying after that manner.
c88600	Then there came out a spirit,
c88601	and stood before the LORD,
c88602	and said,
c88603	I will entice
c88604	him. And the LORD said unto
c88605	him, Wherewith?
c88606	And he said,
c88607	I will go out,
c88608	and be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets.
c88609	And <i>the LORD</i> said,
c88610	Thou shalt entice
c88611	<i>him,</i> and thou shalt also prevail:
c88612	go out,
c88613	and do <i>even</i> so.
c88614	Now
c88615	therefore, behold, the LORD hath put a lying spirit in the mouth of these thy prophets,
c88616	and the LORD hath spoken evil against thee.
c88617	Then Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah came near,
c88618	and smote Micaiah upon the cheek,
c88619	and said,
c88620	Which way
c88621	went the Spirit of the LORD from me to speak unto thee?
c88623	And Micaiah said,
c88624	Behold, thou shalt see on that day
c88625	when thou shalt go into an inner chamber
c88626	to hide thyself.
c88627	Then the king of Israel said,
c88628	Take ye Micaiah,
c88629	and carry him back to Amon the governor of the city, and to Joash the king's son;
c88630	And say,
c88631	Thus saith the king,
c88632	Put this <i>fellow</i> in the prison,
c88633	and feed him with bread of affliction and with water of affliction,
c88634	until I return in peace.
c88635	And Micaiah said,
c88636	If thou certainly return in peace,
c88637	<i>then</i> hath not the LORD spoken
c88638	by me. And he said,
c88639	Hearken,
c88640	all ye people.
c88641	So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up to Ramothgilead.
c88642	And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat,
c88643	I will disguise myself,
c88644	and will go to the battle;
c88645	but put thou on thy robes.
c88646	So the king of Israel disguised himself;
c88647	and they went to the battle.
c88648	Now the king of Syria had commanded the captains of the chariots
c88649	that
c88650	<i>were</i> with him, saying,
c88651	Fight ye not with small or great,
c88652	save only with the king of Israel.
c88653	And it came to pass,
c88654	when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat,
c88655	that they said,
c88656	It <i>is</i> the king of Israel.
c88657	Therefore they compassed about
c88658	him to fight:
c88659	but Jehoshaphat cried out,
c88660	and the LORD helped
c88661	him; and God moved them <i>to depart</i> from him.
c88662	For it came to pass,
c88663	that, when the captains of the chariots perceived
c88664	that it was not the king of Israel,
c88665	they turned back again from pursuing him.
c88666	And a <i>certain</i> man drew a bow at a venture,
c88667	and smote the king of Israel between the joints of the harness:
c88668	therefore he said to his chariot man,
c88669	Turn thine hand,
c88670	that thou mayest carry me out of the host;
c88671	for I am wounded.
c88672	And the battle increased that day:
c88673	howbeit the king of Israel stayed <i>himself</i> up in <i>his</i> chariot against the Syrians until the even:
c88674	and about the time of the sun going down he died.
c88676	And Jehoshaphat the king of Judah returned to his house in peace to Jerusalem.
c88677	And Jehu the son of Hanani the seer went out to meet
c88678	him, and said to king Jehoshaphat,
c88679	the ungodly,
c88680	Shouldest thou help
c88682	them that hate the LORD?
c88683	and love
c88684	therefore <i>is</i> wrath upon thee from before the LORD.
c88685	Nevertheless there are good things found in
c88686	thee, in that thou hast taken away the groves out of the land,
c88687	and hast prepared thine heart
c88688	to seek God.
c88689	And Jehoshaphat dwelt at Jerusalem:
c88691	and he went out again through the people from Beersheba to mount Ephraim,
c88692	and brought them back unto the LORD God of their fathers.
c88693	And he set judges in the land throughout all the fenced cities of Judah, city by city,
c88694	And said to the judges,
c88695	Take heed
c88696	what ye do:
c88697	for ye judge not for man,
c88698	but for the LORD,
c88699	who <i>is</i> with you in the judgment.
c88700	Wherefore now
c88701	let the fear of the LORD be upon
c88702	you; take heed
c88703	and do
c88704	<i>it:</i> for <i>there is</i> no iniquity with the LORD our God, nor respect of persons, nor taking of gifts.
c88705	Moreover in Jerusalem did Jehoshaphat set of the Levites, and <i>of</i> the priests, and of the chief of the fathers of Israel, for the judgment of the LORD, and for controversies,
c88706	when they returned to Jerusalem.
c88707	And he charged
c88708	them, saying,
c88709	Thus shall ye do in the fear of the LORD, faithfully, and with a perfect heart.
c88710	And what cause soever
c88711	shall come to you of your brethren
c88712	that dwell in their cities,
c88713	between blood and blood, between law and commandment, statutes and judgments,
c88714	ye shall even warn
c88715	them that they trespass not against the LORD,
c88716	and <i>so</i> wrath come upon you, and upon your brethren:
c88717	this do,
c88718	and ye shall not trespass.
c88719	And, behold,
c88720	Amariah the chief priest <i>is</i> over you in all matters of the LORD;
c88721	and Zebadiah the son of Ishmael, the ruler of the house of Judah, for all the king's matters:
c88722	also the Levites <i>shall be</i> officers before
c88723	courageously,
c88724	you. Deal
c88725	and the LORD shall be with the good.
c88726	It came to pass after this
c88727	also, <i>that</i> the children of Moab, and the children of Ammon, and with them <i>other</i> beside the Ammonites, came
c88729	against Jehoshaphat to battle.
c88730	Then there came
c88731	some that told Jehoshaphat,
c88732	saying,
c88733	There cometh a great multitude against thee from beyond the sea on this side Syria;
c88734	and, behold, they <i>be</i> in Hazazontamar,
c88735	which <i>is</i> Engedi.
c88737	And Jehoshaphat feared, and set himself
c88738	to seek the LORD,
c88739	and proclaimed a fast throughout all Judah.
c88740	And Judah gathered themselves together,
c88741	to ask <i>help</i> of the LORD:
c88742	even out of all the cities of Judah they came
c88743	to seek the LORD.
c88744	And Jehoshaphat stood in the congregation of Judah and Jerusalem, in the house of the LORD, before the new court,
c88745	And said,
c88746	O LORD God of our fathers,
c88747	<i>art</i> not thou God in heaven?
c88748	and rulest <i>not</i> thou over all the kingdoms of the heathen?
c88749	and in thine hand <i>is there not</i> power and might,
c88750	so that none
c88751	is able to withstand thee?
c88752	<i>Art</i> not thou
c88753	our God,
c88754	<i>who</i> didst drive out the inhabitants of this land before thy people Israel,
c88755	and gavest it to the seed of Abraham thy friend for ever?
c88756	And they dwelt
c88757	therein, and have built thee a sanctuary therein for thy name,
c88758	saying,
c88759	If, <i>when</i> evil cometh upon us, <i>as</i> the sword, judgment, or pestilence, or famine,
c88760	we stand before this house, and in thy presence,
c88761	(for thy name <i>is</i> in this house,)
c88762	and cry unto thee in our affliction,
c88763	then thou wilt hear
c88764	and help.
c88765	And now,
c88766	behold, the children of Ammon and Moab and mount Seir,
c88767	whom thou wouldest not let Israel
c88768	invade,
c88769	when they came out of the land of Egypt,
c88770	but they turned from
c88771	them, and destroyed them not;
c88772	Behold, <i>I say, how</i> they reward
c88773	us, to come
c88774	to cast us out of thy possession,
c88775	which thou hast given us to inherit.
c88776	O our God,
c88777	wilt thou not judge
c88778	them? for we have no might against this great company
c88779	that cometh against
c88780	us; neither know we
c88781	what to do:
c88782	but our eyes <i>are</i> upon thee.
c88783	And all Judah stood before the LORD,
c88784	with their little ones, their wives, and their children.
c88786	Then upon Jahaziel the son of Zechariah, the son of Benaiah, the son of Jeiel, the son of Mattaniah, a Levite of the sons of Asaph, came the Spirit of the LORD in the midst of the congregation;
c88787	And he said,
c88788	Hearken
c88789	ye, all Judah, and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem, and thou king Jehoshaphat,
c88790	Thus saith the LORD
c88791	unto you, Be not afraid
c88792	nor dismayed by reason of this great multitude;
c88793	for the battle <i>is</i> not
c88794	yours, but God's.
c88795	To morrow go ye down against
c88796	them: behold, they come up by the cliff of Ziz;
c88797	and ye shall find them at the end of the brook, before the wilderness of Jeruel.
c88798	Ye shall not
c88799	<i>need</i> to fight in this
c88800	<i>battle:</i> set yourselves,
c88801	stand
c88802	ye <i>still,</i> and see the salvation of the LORD with
c88803	you, O Judah and Jerusalem:
c88804	fear not,
c88805	nor be dismayed;
c88806	to morrow go out against
c88807	them: for the LORD <i>will be</i> with you.
c88808	And Jehoshaphat bowed his head
c88809	with <i>his</i> face to the ground:
c88810	and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem fell before the LORD,
c88811	worshipping the LORD.
c88812	And the Levites, of the children of the Kohathites, and of the children of the Korhites, stood up
c88813	to praise the LORD God of Israel with a loud voice on high.
c88814	And they rose early in the morning,
c88815	and went forth into the wilderness of Tekoa:
c88817	and as they went forth,
c88818	Jehoshaphat stood
c88819	and said,
c88820	Hear
c88821	me, O Judah, and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem;
c88822	Believe in the LORD your God,
c88823	so shall ye be established;
c88824	believe his prophets,
c88825	so shall ye prosper.
c88826	And when he had consulted with the people,
c88827	he appointed
c88828	singers unto the LORD,
c88829	and that should praise the beauty of holiness,
c88830	as they went out before the army,
c88831	and to say,
c88832	Praise the LORD;
c88833	for his mercy <i>endureth</i> for ever.
c88834	And when
c88835	they began to sing and to praise,
c88836	the LORD set ambushments against the children of Ammon, Moab, and mount Seir,
c88837	which were come against Judah;
c88838	and they were smitten.
c88839	For the children of Ammon and Moab stood up against the inhabitants of mount Seir,
c88840	utterly to slay
c88841	and destroy
c88843	<i>them:</i> and when they had made an end of the inhabitants of Seir,
c88845	every one helped
c88846	to destroy another.
c88847	And when Judah came toward the watch tower in the wilderness,
c88848	they looked unto the multitude,
c88849	and, behold, they <i>were</i> dead bodies
c88850	fallen to the earth,
c88851	and none escaped.
c88852	And when Jehoshaphat and his people came
c88853	to take away the spoil
c88854	of them, they found among them in abundance
c88855	both riches with the dead bodies, and precious jewels,
c88856	which they stripped off for themselves, more than they could carry away:
c88857	and they were three days in gathering of the spoil,
c88858	it was so much.
c88859	And on the fourth day they assembled themselves in the valley of Berachah;
c88860	for there they blessed the LORD:
c88861	therefore the name of the same place was called, The valley of Berachah, unto this day.
c88862	Then they returned, every man of Judah and Jerusalem,
c88863	and Jehoshaphat in the forefront
c88864	of them, to go again to Jerusalem with joy;
c88865	for the LORD had made them to rejoice over their enemies.
c88866	And they came to Jerusalem with psalteries and harps and trumpets unto the house of the LORD.
c88867	And the fear of God was on all the kingdoms of <i>those</i> countries,
c88868	when they had heard
c88869	that the LORD fought against the enemies of Israel.
c88870	So the realm of Jehoshaphat was quiet:
c88871	for his God gave him rest round about.
c88872	And Jehoshaphat reigned over Judah:
c88873	<i>he was</i> thirty and five years old
c88874	when he began to reign,
c88875	and he reigned twenty and five years in Jerusalem.
c88876	And his mother's name <i>was</i> Azubah the daughter of Shilhi.
c88877	And he walked in the way of Asa his father,
c88878	and departed not from
c88879	it, doing
c88880	<i>that which was</i> right in the sight of the LORD.
c88881	Howbeit the high places were not taken away:
c88882	for as yet the people had not prepared their hearts unto the God of their fathers.
c88883	Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, first and last,
c88884	behold, they <i>are</i> written in the book of Jehu the son of Hanani,
c88885	who <i>is</i> mentioned in the book of the kings of Israel.
c88886	And after this did Jehoshaphat king of Judah join himself with Ahaziah king of Israel,
c88887	who did very wickedly:
c88889	And he joined himself with
c88890	him to make ships
c88891	to go to Tarshish:
c88892	and they made the ships in Eziongeber.
c88893	Then Eliezer the son of Dodavah of Mareshah prophesied against Jehoshaphat,
c88894	saying,
c88895	Because thou hast joined thyself with Ahaziah,
c88896	the LORD hath broken thy works.
c88897	And the ships were broken,
c88898	that they were not able
c88899	to go to Tarshish.
c88900	Now Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers,
c88901	and was buried with his fathers in the city of David.
c88902	And Jehoram his son reigned in his stead.
c88903	And he had brethren the sons of Jehoshaphat, Azariah, and Jehiel, and Zechariah, and Azariah, and Michael, and Shephatiah:
c88904	all these <i>were</i> the sons of Jehoshaphat king of Israel.
c88905	And their father gave them great gifts of silver, and of gold, and of precious things, with fenced cities in Judah:
c88906	but the kingdom gave he to Jehoram;
c88907	because he <i>was</i> the firstborn.
c88908	Now when Jehoram was risen up to the kingdom of his father,
c88909	he strengthened himself,
c88910	and slew all his brethren with the sword,
c88911	and <i>divers</i> also of the princes of Israel.
c88912	Jehoram <i>was</i> thirty and two years old
c88913	when he began to reign,
c88914	and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem.
c88915	And he walked in the way of the kings of Israel,
c88916	like as did the house of Ahab:
c88917	for he had the daughter of Ahab to wife:
c88918	and he wrought
c88919	<i>that which was</i> evil in the eyes of the LORD.
c88920	Howbeit the LORD would not
c88921	destroy the house of David,
c88922	because of the covenant
c88923	that he had made with David,
c88924	and as he promised
c88925	to give a light
c88926	to him and to his sons for ever.
c88927	In his days the Edomites revolted from under the dominion of Judah,
c88928	and made themselves a king.
c88929	Then Jehoram went forth with his princes,
c88930	and all his chariots with
c88931	him: and he rose up
c88932	by night,
c88933	and smote the Edomites
c88934	which compassed
c88935	him in, and the captains of the chariots.
c88936	So the Edomites revolted from under the hand of Judah unto this day.
c88937	The same time <i>also</i> did Libnah revolt from under his hand;
c88938	because he had forsaken the LORD God of his fathers.
c88939	Moreover he made high places in the mountains of Judah,
c88940	and caused the inhabitants of Jerusalem to commit fornication,
c88941	and compelled Judah <i>thereto.</i>
c88942	And there came a writing to him from Elijah the prophet,
c88943	saying,
c88944	Thus saith the LORD God of David thy father,
c88945	Because thou hast not walked in the ways of Jehoshaphat thy father, nor in the ways of Asa king of Judah,
c88946	But hast walked in the way of the kings of Israel,
c88947	and hast made Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to go a whoring,
c88948	like to the whoredoms of the house of Ahab,
c88949	and also hast slain thy brethren of thy father's house,
c88950	<i>which were</i> better than thyself:
c88952	Behold, with a great plague will the LORD smite thy people, and thy children, and thy wives, and all thy goods:
c88953	And thou <i>shalt have</i> great sickness by disease of thy bowels,
c88954	until thy bowels fall out by reason of the sickness day by day.
c88955	Moreover the LORD stirred up against Jehoram the spirit of the Philistines, and of the Arabians,
c88956	that <i>were</i> near the Ethiopians:
c88957	And they came up into Judah,
c88958	and brake into
c88959	it, and carried away all the substance
c88960	that was found in the king's house,
c88961	and his sons also, and his wives;
c88962	so that there was never a son left
c88963	him, save Jehoahaz, the youngest of his sons.
c88964	And after all this the LORD smote him in his bowels with an incurable disease.
c88965	And it came to pass, that in process of time,
c88966	after the end
c88967	of two years,
c88968	his bowels fell out by reason of his sickness:
c88969	so he died of sore diseases.
c88970	And his people made no burning for him, like the burning of his fathers.
c88971	Thirty and two years old was
c88972	he when he began to reign,
c88973	and he reigned in Jerusalem eight years,
c88974	and departed without being desired.
c88975	Howbeit they buried him in the city of David,
c88976	but not in the sepulchres of the kings.
c88977	And the inhabitants of Jerusalem made Ahaziah his youngest son king in his stead:
c88978	for the band of men that came with the Arabians to the camp had slain all the eldest.
c88980	So Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah reigned.
c88981	Forty and two years old <i>was</i> Ahaziah
c88982	when he began to reign,
c88983	and he reigned one year in Jerusalem.
c88984	His mother's name also <i>was</i> Athaliah the daughter of Omri.
c88985	He also walked in the ways of the house of Ahab:
c88986	for his mother was his counsellor
c88987	to do wickedly.
c88988	Wherefore he did
c88989	evil in the sight of the LORD
c88990	like the house of Ahab:
c88991	for they were his counsellors after the death of his father to his destruction.
c88992	He walked also after their counsel,
c88993	and went with Jehoram the son of Ahab king of Israel to war against Hazael king of Syria at Ramothgilead:
c88994	and the Syrians smote Joram.
c88995	And he returned
c88996	to be healed in Jezreel
c88997	because of the wounds
c88998	which were given him at Ramah,
c88999	when he fought with Hazael king of Syria.
c89000	And Azariah the son of Jehoram king of Judah went down
c89001	to see Jehoram the son of Ahab at Jezreel,
c89002	because he was sick.
c89003	And the destruction of Ahaziah was of God
c89004	by coming to Joram:
c89006	for when he was come,
c89007	he went out with Jehoram against Jehu the son of Nimshi,
c89008	whom the LORD had anointed
c89009	to cut off the house of Ahab.
c89010	And it came to pass,
c89011	that, when Jehu was executing judgment upon the house of Ahab,
c89012	and found the princes of Judah, and the sons of the brethren of Ahaziah,
c89013	that ministered to Ahaziah,
c89014	he slew them.
c89015	And he sought Ahaziah:
c89016	and they caught
c89017	him, (for he was hid in Samaria,)
c89018	and brought him to Jehu:
c89019	and when they had slain
c89020	him, they buried
c89021	him: Because, said
c89022	they, he <i>is</i> the son of Jehoshaphat,
c89023	who sought the LORD with all his heart.
c89024	So the house of Ahaziah had no
c89025	power to keep still the kingdom.
c89026	But when Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw
c89027	that her son was dead,
c89028	she arose
c89029	and destroyed all the seed royal of the house of Judah.
c89030	But Jehoshabeath, the daughter of the king, took Joash the son of Ahaziah,
c89031	and stole him from among the king's sons
c89032	that were slain,
c89033	and put him and his nurse in a bedchamber.
c89034	So Jehoshabeath, the daughter of king Jehoram, the wife of Jehoiada the priest, (for she was the sister of Ahaziah,) hid
c89036	him from Athaliah,
c89037	so that she slew him not.
c89038	And he was with them hid in the house of God
c89039	six years:
c89040	and Athaliah reigned over the land.
c89041	And in the seventh year Jehoiada strengthened himself,
c89042	and took the captains of hundreds, Azariah the son of Jeroham, and Ishmael the son of Jehohanan, and Azariah the son of Obed, and Maaseiah the son of Adaiah, and Elishaphat the son of Zichri, into covenant with him.
c89043	And they went about in Judah,
c89044	and gathered the Levites out of all the cities of Judah,
c89045	and the chief of the fathers of Israel,
c89046	and they came to Jerusalem.
c89047	And all the congregation made a covenant with the king in the house of God.
c89048	And he said
c89049	unto them, Behold, the king's son shall reign,
c89050	as the LORD hath said of the sons of David.
c89051	This <i>is</i> the thing
c89052	that ye shall do;
c89053	A third part of you entering on the sabbath, of the priests and of the Levites, <i>shall be</i> porters of the doors;
c89054	And a third part <i>shall be</i> at the king's house;
c89055	and a third part at the gate of the foundation:
c89056	and all the people <i>shall be</i> in the courts of the house of the LORD.
c89057	But let none come into the house of the LORD,
c89058	save the priests, and they that minister of the Levites;
c89059	they shall go in,
c89060	for they <i>are</i> holy:
c89061	but all the people shall keep the watch of the LORD.
c89062	And the Levites shall compass the king round about,
c89063	every man
c89064	with his weapons in his hand;
c89066	and whosoever <i>else</i> cometh into the house,
c89067	he shall be put to death:
c89068	but be ye with the king
c89069	when he cometh in,
c89070	and when he goeth out.
c89071	So the Levites and all Judah did according to all things
c89072	that Jehoiada the priest had commanded,
c89073	and took
c89074	every man his men that were to come in on the sabbath, with them that were to go <i>out</i> on the sabbath:
c89075	for Jehoiada the priest dismissed not the courses.
c89076	Moreover Jehoiada the priest delivered to the captains of hundreds spears, and bucklers, and shields,
c89077	that <i>had been</i> king David's,
c89078	which <i>were</i> in the house of God.
c89079	And he set all the people,
c89080	every man
c89081	having his weapon in his hand,
c89082	from the right side of the temple to the left side of the temple, along by the altar and the temple, by the king round about.
c89083	Then they brought out the king's son,
c89084	and put upon him the crown, and <i>gave him</i> the testimony,
c89085	and made him king.
c89086	And Jehoiada and his sons anointed
c89087	him, and said,
c89088	God save the king.
c89089	Now when Athaliah heard the noise of the people
c89090	running
c89091	and praising the king,
c89092	she came to the people into the house of the LORD:
c89093	And she looked,
c89094	and, behold,
c89095	the king stood at his pillar at the entering in,
c89096	and the princes and the trumpets by the king:
c89097	and all the people of the land rejoiced,
c89098	and sounded with trumpets,
c89099	also the singers with instruments of musick,
c89100	and such as taught
c89101	to sing praise.
c89102	Then Athaliah rent her clothes,
c89103	and said,
c89104	Treason, Treason.
c89105	Then Jehoiada the priest brought out the captains of hundreds that were set over the host,
c89106	and said unto
c89107	them, Have her forth of the ranges:
c89109	and whoso followeth
c89110	her, let him be slain with the sword.
c89111	For the priest said,
c89112	Slay her not in the house of the LORD.
c89113	So they laid hands
c89114	on her; and when she was come to the entering of the horse gate by the king's house,
c89115	they slew her there.
c89116	And Jehoiada made a covenant between him, and between all the people, and between the king,
c89117	that they should be the LORD'S people.
c89118	Then all the people went to the house of Baal,
c89119	and brake it down,
c89120	and brake his altars and his images in pieces,
c89121	and slew Mattan the priest of Baal before the altars.
c89122	Also Jehoiada appointed the offices of the house of the LORD by the hand of the priests the Levites,
c89123	whom David had distributed in the house of the LORD,
c89124	to offer the burnt offerings of the LORD,
c89125	as <i>it is</i> written in the law of Moses,
c89126	with rejoicing and with singing, <i>as it was ordained</i> by David.
c89127	And he set the porters at the gates of the house of the LORD,
c89128	that none <i>which was</i> unclean in any thing should enter in.
c89129	And he took the captains of hundreds, and the nobles, and the governors of the people, and all the people of the land,
c89130	and brought down the king from the house of the LORD:
c89131	and they came through the high gate into the king's house,
c89132	and set the king upon the throne of the kingdom.
c89133	And all the people of the land rejoiced:
c89134	and the city was quiet,
c89135	after that they had slain Athaliah with the sword.
c89136	Joash <i>was</i> seven years old
c89137	when he began to reign,
c89138	and he reigned forty years in Jerusalem.
c89139	His mother's name also <i>was</i> Zibiah of Beersheba.
c89140	of Jehoiada the priest.
c89142	And Joash did <i>that which was</i> right in the sight of the LORD all the days
c89143	And Jehoiada took for him two wives;
c89144	and he begat sons and daughters.
c89145	And it came to pass after this,
c89146	<i>that</i> Joash was minded
c89147	to repair the house of the LORD.
c89148	And he gathered together the priests and the Levites,
c89149	and said
c89150	to them, Go out unto the cities of Judah,
c89151	and gather of all Israel money
c89152	to repair the house of your God
c89153	from year to year,
c89154	and see that ye hasten the matter.
c89155	Howbeit the Levites hastened <i>it</i> not.
c89156	And the king called for Jehoiada the chief,
c89157	and said
c89158	unto him, Why hast thou not required of the Levites
c89159	to bring in out of Judah and out of Jerusalem the collection, <i>according to the commandment</i> of Moses the servant of the LORD, and of the congregation of Israel, for the tabernacle of witness?
c89160	For the sons of Athaliah, that wicked woman,
c89161	had broken up the house of God;
c89162	and also all the dedicated things of the house of the LORD did they bestow upon Baalim.
c89163	And at the king's commandment
c89164	they made a chest,
c89165	and set it without at the gate of the house of the LORD.
c89166	And they made a proclamation through Judah and Jerusalem,
c89167	to bring in to the LORD the collection <i>that</i> Moses the servant of God <i>laid</i> upon Israel in the wilderness.
c89168	And all the princes and all the people rejoiced,
c89169	and brought in,
c89170	and cast into the chest,
c89171	until they had made an end.
c89172	Now it came to pass, that at what time
c89173	the chest was brought unto the king's office by the hand of the Levites,
c89174	and when they saw
c89175	that <i>there was</i> much money,
c89176	the king's scribe and the high priest's officer came
c89177	and emptied the chest,
c89178	and took
c89179	it, and carried it to his place
c89180	again. Thus they did day by day,
c89181	and gathered money in abundance.
c89182	And the king and Jehoiada gave it to such as did the work of the service of the house of the LORD,
c89183	and hired masons and carpenters
c89184	to repair the house of the LORD,
c89185	and also such as wrought iron and brass
c89186	to mend the house of the LORD.
c89187	So the workmen wrought,
c89188	and the work was perfected by
c89189	them, and they set the house of God in his state,
c89190	and strengthened it.
c89192	And when they had finished
c89193	<i>it,</i> they brought the rest of the money before the king and Jehoiada,
c89194	whereof were made vessels for the house of the LORD, <i>even</i> vessels to minister, and to offer <i>withal,</i> and spoons, and vessels of gold and silver.
c89195	And they offered burnt offerings in the house of the LORD continually all the days of Jehoiada.
c89196	But Jehoiada waxed old,
c89197	and was full of days
c89198	when he died;
c89199	an hundred and thirty years old <i>was he</i> when he died.
c89200	And they buried him in the city of David among the kings,
c89201	because he had done good in Israel, both toward God, and toward his house.
c89202	Now after the death of Jehoiada came the princes of Judah,
c89203	and made obeisance to the king.
c89204	Then the king hearkened unto them.
c89205	And they left the house of the LORD God of their fathers,
c89206	and served groves and idols:
c89207	and wrath came upon Judah and Jerusalem for this their trespass.
c89208	Yet he sent prophets
c89209	to them, to bring them again unto the LORD;
c89210	and they testified
c89211	against them: but they would not give ear.
c89212	And the Spirit of God came upon Zechariah the son of Jehoiada the priest,
c89213	which stood above the people,
c89214	and said
c89215	unto them, Thus saith God,
c89216	Why transgress ye the commandments of the LORD,
c89217	that ye cannot prosper?
c89218	because ye have forsaken the LORD,
c89219	he hath also forsaken you.
c89220	And they conspired against
c89221	him, and stoned him with stones at the commandment of the king in the court of the house of the LORD.
c89222	Thus Joash the king remembered not the kindness
c89223	which Jehoiada his father had done to
c89224	him, but slew his son.
c89225	And when he died, he said,
c89226	The LORD look upon
c89227	<i>it,</i> and require <i>it.</i>
c89228	And it came to pass at the end of the year,
c89229	<i>that</i> the host of Syria came up against
c89230	him: and they came to Judah and Jerusalem,
c89231	and destroyed all the princes of the people from among the people,
c89232	and sent all the spoil of them unto the king of Damascus.
c89233	For the army of the Syrians came with a small company of men, and the LORD delivered a very great host
c89234	into their hand,
c89235	because they had forsaken the LORD God of their fathers.
c89236	So they executed judgment against Joash.
c89238	And when they were departed from
c89239	him, (for they left him in great diseases,)
c89240	his own servants conspired against him for the blood of the sons of Jehoiada the priest,
c89241	and slew him on his bed,
c89242	and he died:
c89243	and they buried him in the city of David,
c89244	but they buried him not in the sepulchres of the kings.
c89245	And these
c89246	are they that conspired against
c89247	him; Zabad the son of Shimeath an Ammonitess, and Jehozabad the son of Shimrith a Moabitess.
c89248	Now <i>concerning</i> his sons,
c89249	and the greatness of the burdens <i>laid</i> upon
c89250	him, and the repairing of the house of God,
c89251	behold, they <i>are</i> written in the story of the book of the kings.
c89252	And Amaziah his son reigned in his stead.
c89253	Amaziah <i>was</i> twenty and five years old <i>when</i> he began to reign,
c89254	and he reigned twenty and nine years in Jerusalem.
c89255	And his mother's name <i>was</i> Jehoaddan of Jerusalem.
c89256	And he did
c89257	<i>that which was</i> right in the sight of the LORD,
c89258	but not with a perfect heart.
c89259	Now it came to pass,
c89260	when the kingdom was established to
c89261	him, that he slew his servants
c89262	that had killed the king his father.
c89263	But he slew not their children,
c89264	but
c89265	<i>did</i> as <i>it is</i> written in the law in the book of Moses,
c89266	where the LORD commanded,
c89267	saying,
c89268	The fathers shall not die for the children,
c89269	neither shall the children die for the fathers,
c89270	but
c89271	every man shall die for his own sin.
c89273	Moreover Amaziah gathered Judah together,
c89274	and made them captains over thousands, and captains over hundreds, according to the houses of <i>their</i> fathers, throughout all Judah and Benjamin:
c89275	and he numbered them from twenty years old and above,
c89276	and found them three hundred thousand choice
c89277	<i>men, able</i> to go forth to war,
c89278	that could handle spear and shield.
c89279	He hired also an hundred thousand mighty men of valour out of Israel for an hundred talents of silver.
c89280	But there came a man of God to
c89281	him, saying,
c89282	O king,
c89283	let not the army of Israel go with
c89284	thee; for the LORD <i>is</i> not with Israel, <i>to wit, with</i> all the children of Ephraim.
c89285	But if thou wilt go,
c89286	do
c89287	<i>it,</i> be strong for the battle:
c89288	God shall make thee fall before the enemy:
c89289	for God hath power
c89290	to help,
c89291	and to cast down.
c89292	And Amaziah said to the man of God,
c89293	But what
c89294	shall we do for the hundred talents
c89295	which I have given to the army of Israel?
c89296	And the man of God answered,
c89297	The LORD is
c89298	able to give thee much more than this.
c89299	Then Amaziah separated them, <i>to wit,</i> the army
c89300	that was come to him out of Ephraim,
c89301	to go home
c89302	again: wherefore their anger was greatly kindled against Judah,
c89303	and they returned home in great anger.
c89304	And Amaziah strengthened himself,
c89305	and led forth his people,
c89306	and went to the valley of salt,
c89307	and smote of the children of Seir ten thousand.
c89308	And <i>other</i> ten thousand <i>left</i> alive did the children of Judah carry away captive,
c89309	and brought them unto the top of the rock,
c89310	and cast them down from the top of the rock,
c89311	that they all were broken in pieces.
c89312	But the soldiers of the army
c89313	which Amaziah sent back,
c89314	that they should not go with him to battle,
c89315	fell upon the cities of Judah, from Samaria even unto Bethhoron,
c89316	and smote three thousand of
c89317	them, and took much spoil.
c89318	Now it came to pass,
c89319	after that Amaziah was come
c89320	from the slaughter of the Edomites,
c89321	that he brought the gods of the children of Seir,
c89322	and set them up <i>to be</i> his gods,
c89323	and bowed down himself before
c89324	them, and burned incense unto them.
c89325	Wherefore the anger of the LORD was kindled against Amaziah,
c89326	and he sent unto him a prophet,
c89327	which said
c89328	unto him, Why hast thou sought after the gods of the people,
c89329	which could not deliver their own people out of thine hand?
c89330	And it came to pass,
c89331	as he talked with
c89332	him, that <i>the king</i> said
c89333	unto him, Art thou made of the king's counsel?
c89334	forbear;
c89335	why shouldest thou be smitten?
c89336	Then the prophet forbare,
c89337	and said,
c89338	I know
c89339	that God hath determined
c89340	to destroy
c89341	thee, because thou hast done this,
c89342	and hast not hearkened unto my counsel.
c89343	Then Amaziah king of Judah took advice,
c89344	and sent to Joash, the son of Jehoahaz, the son of Jehu, king of Israel,
c89345	saying,
c89346	Come,
c89347	let us see one another in the face.
c89348	And Joash king of Israel sent to Amaziah king of Judah,
c89349	saying,
c89350	The thistle
c89351	that <i>was</i> in Lebanon
c89352	sent to the cedar
c89353	that <i>was</i> in Lebanon,
c89354	saying,
c89355	Give thy daughter to my son to wife:
c89356	and there passed by a wild beast
c89357	that <i>was</i> in Lebanon,
c89358	and trode down the thistle.
c89359	Thou sayest,
c89360	Lo, thou hast smitten the Edomites;
c89361	and thine heart lifteth thee up
c89362	to boast:
c89363	abide now at home;
c89364	why shouldest thou meddle to <i>thine</i> hurt,
c89365	that thou shouldest fall, <i>even</i> thou,
c89366	and Judah with thee?
c89367	But Amaziah would not hear;
c89368	for it <i>came</i> of God,
c89369	that he might deliver them into the hand
c89370	<i>of their enemies,</i> because they sought after the gods of Edom.
c89371	So Joash the king of Israel went up;
c89372	and they saw one another in the face, <i>both</i> he and Amaziah king of Judah, at Bethshemesh,
c89373	which <i>belongeth</i> to Judah.
c89374	And Judah was put to the worse before Israel,
c89375	and they fled
c89376	every man to his tent.
c89377	And Joash the king of Israel took Amaziah king of Judah, the son of Joash, the son of Jehoahaz, at Bethshemesh,
c89378	and brought him to Jerusalem,
c89379	and brake down the wall of Jerusalem from the gate of Ephraim to the corner gate,
c89381	four hundred cubits.
c89382	And <i>he took</i> all the gold and the silver, and all the vessels
c89383	that were found in the house of God with Obededom,
c89384	and the treasures of the king's house, the hostages
c89385	also, and returned to Samaria.
c89386	And Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah lived after the death of Joash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel fifteen years.
c89387	Now the rest of the acts of Amaziah, first and last,
c89388	behold, <i>are</i> they not written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel?
c89389	Now after the time
c89390	that Amaziah did turn away from following the LORD
c89391	they made a conspiracy against him in Jerusalem;
c89392	and he fled to Lachish:
c89393	but they sent to Lachish after
c89394	him, and slew him there.
c89395	And they brought him upon horses,
c89396	and buried him with his fathers in the city of Judah.
c89397	Then all the people of Judah took Uzziah,
c89398	who <i>was</i> sixteen years old,
c89399	and made him king in the room of his father Amaziah.
c89400	He built Eloth,
c89401	and restored it to Judah,
c89402	after that the king slept with his fathers.
c89403	Sixteen years old <i>was</i> Uzziah
c89404	when he began to reign,
c89405	and he reigned fifty and two years in Jerusalem.
c89406	His mother's name also <i>was</i> Jecoliah of Jerusalem.
c89407	And he did
c89408	<i>that which was</i> right in the sight of the LORD,
c89409	according to all
c89410	that his father Amaziah did.
c89411	And he sought
c89412	God in the days of Zechariah,
c89413	who had understanding
c89414	in the visions of God:
c89415	and as long as
c89416	he sought the LORD,
c89417	God made him to prosper.
c89418	And he went forth
c89419	and warred against the Philistines,
c89420	and brake down the wall of Gath, and the wall of Jabneh, and the wall of Ashdod,
c89421	and built cities about Ashdod, and among the Philistines.
c89422	And God helped him against the Philistines, and against the Arabians
c89423	that dwelt in Gurbaal,
c89424	and the Mehunims.
c89425	And the Ammonites gave gifts to Uzziah:
c89426	and his name spread abroad
c89427	<i>even</i> to the entering in of Egypt;
c89428	for he strengthened <i>himself</i> exceedingly.
c89429	Moreover Uzziah built towers in Jerusalem at the corner gate, and at the valley gate, and at the turning
c89430	<i>of the wall,</i> and fortified them.
c89431	Also he built towers in the desert,
c89432	and digged many wells:
c89433	for he had much cattle,
c89434	both in the low country, and in the plains:
c89435	husbandmen <i>also,</i> and vine dressers in the mountains, and in Carmel:
c89436	for he loved husbandry.
c89437	Moreover Uzziah had an host
c89438	of fighting men,
c89439	that went out to war by bands, according to the number of their account by the hand of Jeiel the scribe and Maaseiah the ruler, under the hand of Hananiah, <i>one</i> of the king's captains.
c89440	The whole number of the chief of the fathers of the mighty men of valour <i>were</i> two thousand and six hundred.
c89441	And under their hand <i>was</i> an army, three hundred thousand and seven thousand and five hundred, that made war with mighty
c89442	power,
c89443	to help the king against the enemy.
c89444	And Uzziah prepared for them throughout all the host shields, and spears, and helmets, and habergeons, and bows, and slings <i>to cast</i> stones.
c89445	And he made in Jerusalem engines,
c89446	invented by cunning men,
c89447	to be on the towers and upon the bulwarks,
c89448	to shoot arrows and great stones
c89449	withal. And his name spread far abroad;
c89450	for he was marvellously
c89451	helped,
c89452	till he was strong.
c89453	But when he was strong, his heart was lifted up
c89454	to <i>his</i> destruction:
c89455	for he transgressed against the LORD his God,
c89456	and went into the temple of the LORD
c89457	to burn incense upon the altar of incense.
c89458	And Azariah the priest went in after
c89459	him, and with him fourscore priests of the LORD, <i>that were</i> valiant men:
c89460	And they withstood Uzziah the king,
c89461	and said
c89462	unto him, <i>It appertaineth</i> not
c89463	unto thee, Uzziah,
c89464	to burn incense unto the LORD,
c89465	but to the priests the sons of Aaron,
c89466	that are consecrated
c89467	to burn incense:
c89468	go out of the sanctuary;
c89469	for thou hast trespassed;
c89470	neither <i>shall it be</i> for thine honour from the LORD God.
c89471	Then Uzziah was wroth,
c89472	and <i>had</i> a censer in his hand
c89473	to burn incense:
c89474	and while he was wroth with the priests,
c89475	the leprosy even rose up in his forehead before the priests in the house of the LORD, from beside the incense altar.
c89476	And Azariah the chief priest, and all the priests, looked upon
c89477	him, and, behold,
c89478	he <i>was</i> leprous in his forehead,
c89479	and they thrust him out from thence;
c89480	yea, himself hasted also
c89481	to go out,
c89482	because the LORD had smitten him.
c89483	And Uzziah the king was a leper unto the day of his death,
c89484	and dwelt in a several house,
c89485	<i>being</i> a leper;
c89486	for he was cut off from the house of the LORD:
c89487	and Jotham his son <i>was</i> over the king's house,
c89488	judging the people of the land.
c89489	Now the rest of the acts of Uzziah, first and last, did Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz, write.
c89490	So Uzziah slept with his fathers,
c89491	and they buried him with his fathers in the field of the burial
c89492	which <i>belonged</i> to the kings;
c89493	for they said,
c89494	He <i>is</i> a leper:
c89495	and Jotham his son reigned in his stead.
c89496	Jotham <i>was</i> twenty and five years old
c89497	when he began to reign,
c89498	and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem.
c89499	His mother's name also <i>was</i> Jerushah, the daughter of Zadok.
c89500	And he did
c89501	<i>that which was</i> right in the sight of the LORD,
c89502	according to all
c89503	that his father Uzziah did:
c89504	howbeit he entered not into the temple of the LORD.
c89505	And the people did yet corruptly.
c89506	He built the high gate of the house of the LORD,
c89507	and on the wall of Ophel he built much.
c89508	Moreover he built cities in the mountains of Judah,
c89509	and in the forests he built castles and towers.
c89510	He fought also with the king of the Ammonites,
c89511	and prevailed against
c89512	them. And the children of Ammon gave him the same year an hundred talents of silver, and ten thousand measures of wheat, and ten thousand of barley.
c89513	So much did the children of Ammon pay
c89514	unto him, both the second year, and the third.
c89515	So Jotham became mighty,
c89516	because he prepared his ways before the LORD his God.
c89517	Now the rest of the acts of Jotham, and all his wars, and his ways,
c89518	lo, they <i>are</i> written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah.
c89519	He was five and twenty years old
c89520	when he began to reign,
c89521	and reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem.
c89522	And Jotham slept with his fathers,
c89523	and they buried him in the city of David:
c89524	and Ahaz his son reigned in his stead.
c89525	Ahaz <i>was</i> twenty years old
c89526	when he began to reign,
c89527	and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem:
c89528	but he did not
c89529	<i>that which was</i> right in the sight of the LORD,
c89530	like David his father:
c89531	For he walked in the ways of the kings of Israel,
c89532	and made also molten images for Baalim.
c89533	Moreover he burnt incense in the valley of the son of Hinnom,
c89534	and burnt his children in the fire, after the abominations of the heathen
c89535	whom the LORD had cast out before the children of Israel.
c89536	He sacrificed
c89537	also and burnt incense in the high places, and on the hills, and under every green tree.
c89538	Wherefore the LORD his God delivered him into the hand of the king of Syria;
c89539	and they smote
c89540	him, and carried away a great multitude of them captives,
c89541	and brought <i>them</i> to Damascus.
c89542	And he was also delivered into the hand of the king of Israel,
c89543	who smote him with a great slaughter.
c89544	For Pekah the son of Remaliah slew in Judah an hundred and twenty thousand in one day,
c89545	<i>which were</i> all valiant men;
c89546	because they had forsaken the LORD God of their fathers.
c89547	And Zichri, a mighty man of Ephraim, slew Maaseiah the king's son, and Azrikam the governor of the house, and Elkanah <i>that was</i> next to the king.
c89548	And the children of Israel carried away captive of their brethren two hundred thousand, women, sons, and daughters,
c89549	and took also away much spoil from
c89550	them, and brought the spoil to Samaria.
c89551	But a prophet of the LORD was there,
c89552	whose name <i>was</i> Oded:
c89553	and he went out before the host
c89554	that came to Samaria,
c89555	and said
c89556	unto them, Behold, because the LORD God of your fathers was wroth with Judah, he hath delivered them into your hand,
c89557	and ye have slain them in a rage
c89558	<i>that</i> reacheth up unto heaven.
c89559	And now ye purpose
c89561	to keep under the children of Judah and Jerusalem for bondmen and bondwomen
c89562	unto you: <i>but are there</i> not with you, even with you,
c89563	sins against the LORD your God?
c89564	Now
c89565	hear
c89566	me therefore, and deliver the captives
c89567	again, which ye have taken captive of your brethren:
c89568	for the fierce wrath of the LORD <i>is</i> upon you.
c89569	Then certain of the heads of the children of Ephraim, Azariah the son of Johanan, Berechiah the son of Meshillemoth, and Jehizkiah the son of Shallum, and Amasa the son of Hadlai, stood up
c89570	against them that came from the war,
c89571	And said
c89572	unto them, Ye shall not bring in the captives hither:
c89573	for whereas we have offended against the LORD <i>already,</i> ye intend
c89574	to add <i>more</i> to our sins and to our trespass:
c89575	for our trespass is great,
c89576	and <i>there is</i> fierce wrath against Israel.
c89577	So the armed men left the captives and the spoil before the princes and all the congregation.
c89578	And the men which were expressed by name rose up,
c89580	and took the captives,
c89581	and with the spoil clothed all that were naked
c89582	among them, and arrayed
c89583	them, and shod
c89584	them, and gave them to eat
c89585	and to drink,
c89586	and anointed
c89587	them, and carried all the feeble of them upon asses,
c89588	and brought them to Jericho, the city of palm trees, to their brethren:
c89589	then they returned to Samaria.
c89590	At that time did king Ahaz send unto the kings of Assyria
c89591	to help him.
c89592	For again the Edomites had come
c89593	and smitten Judah,
c89594	and carried away captives.
c89595	The Philistines also had invaded the cities of the low country, and of the south of Judah,
c89596	and had taken Bethshemesh, and Ajalon, and Gederoth, and Shocho with the villages thereof, and Timnah with the villages thereof, Gimzo also and the villages
c89597	thereof: and they dwelt there.
c89598	For the LORD brought Judah low because of Ahaz king of Israel;
c89599	for he made Judah naked,
c89600	and transgressed sore against the LORD.
c89601	And Tilgathpilneser king of Assyria came unto
c89602	him, and distressed
c89603	him, but strengthened him not.
c89604	For Ahaz took away a portion <i>out</i> of the house of the LORD, and <i>out</i> of the house of the king, and of the princes,
c89605	and gave <i>it</i> unto the king of Assyria:
c89606	but he helped him not.
c89607	And in the time
c89608	of his distress
c89610	did he trespass yet more against the LORD:
c89611	this <i>is that</i> king Ahaz.
c89612	For he sacrificed unto the gods of Damascus,
c89613	which smote
c89614	him: and he said,
c89615	Because the gods of the kings of Syria
c89616	help them, <i>therefore</i> will I sacrifice
c89618	to them, that they may help me. But they
c89619	were
c89620	the ruin
c89621	of him, and of all Israel.
c89622	And Ahaz gathered together the vessels of the house of God,
c89623	and cut in pieces the vessels of the house of God,
c89624	and shut up the doors of the house of the LORD,
c89625	and he made him altars in every corner of Jerusalem.
c89626	And in every several city of Judah he made high places
c89627	to burn incense unto other gods,
c89628	and provoked to anger the LORD God of his fathers.
c89629	Now the rest of his acts and of all his ways, first and last,
c89630	behold, they <i>are</i> written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.
c89631	And Ahaz slept with his fathers,
c89632	and they buried him in the city, <i>even</i> in Jerusalem:
c89633	but they brought him not into the sepulchres of the kings of Israel:
c89634	and Hezekiah his son reigned in his stead.
c89635	Hezekiah began to reign <i>when he was</i> five and twenty years old,
c89636	and he reigned nine and twenty years in Jerusalem.
c89637	And his mother's name <i>was</i> Abijah, the daughter of Zechariah.
c89638	And he did
c89639	<i>that which was</i> right in the sight of the LORD,
c89640	according to all
c89641	that David his father had done.
c89642	He in the first year
c89643	of his reign,
c89644	in the first month, opened the doors of the house of the LORD,
c89645	and repaired them.
c89646	And he brought in the priests and the Levites,
c89647	and gathered them together into the east street,
c89648	And said
c89649	unto them, Hear
c89650	me, ye Levites,
c89651	sanctify now yourselves,
c89652	and sanctify the house of the LORD God of your fathers,
c89653	and carry forth the filthiness out of the holy <i>place.</i>
c89654	For our fathers have trespassed,
c89655	and done
c89656	<i>that which was</i> evil in the eyes of the LORD our God,
c89657	and have forsaken
c89658	him, and have turned away their faces from the habitation of the LORD,
c89659	and turned <i>their</i> backs.
c89660	Also they have shut up the doors of the porch,
c89661	and put out the lamps,
c89662	and have not burned incense
c89663	nor offered burnt offerings in the holy <i>place</i> unto the God of Israel.
c89664	Wherefore the wrath of the LORD was upon Judah and Jerusalem,
c89665	and he hath delivered them to trouble, to astonishment, and to hissing,
c89666	as ye see with your eyes.
c89667	For, lo, our fathers have fallen by the sword,
c89668	and our sons and our daughters and our wives <i>are</i> in captivity for this.
c89669	Now <i>it is</i> in mine heart
c89670	to make a covenant with the LORD God of Israel,
c89671	that his fierce wrath may turn away from us.
c89672	My sons,
c89673	be not now negligent:
c89674	for the LORD hath chosen
c89675	you to stand before
c89676	him, to serve
c89677	him, and that ye should minister
c89678	unto him, and burn incense.
c89679	Then the Levites arose,
c89680	Mahath the son of Amasai, and Joel the son of Azariah, of the sons of the Kohathites:
c89681	and of the sons of Merari, Kish the son of Abdi, and Azariah the son of Jehalelel:
c89682	and of the Gershonites; Joah the son of Zimmah, and Eden the son of Joah:
c89683	And of the sons of Elizaphan; Shimri, and Jeiel:
c89684	and of the sons of Asaph; Zechariah, and Mattaniah:
c89685	And of the sons of Heman; Jehiel, and Shimei:
c89686	and of the sons of Jeduthun; Shemaiah, and Uzziel.
c89687	And they gathered their brethren,
c89688	and sanctified themselves,
c89689	and came, according to the commandment of the king, by the words of the LORD,
c89690	to cleanse the house of the LORD.
c89691	And the priests went into the inner part of the house of the LORD,
c89692	to cleanse
c89693	<i>it,</i> and brought out all the uncleanness
c89694	that they found in the temple of the LORD
c89695	into the court of the house of the LORD.
c89696	And the Levites took
c89697	<i>it,</i> to carry <i>it</i> out abroad into the brook Kidron.
c89698	Now they began on the first <i>day</i> of the first month
c89699	to sanctify,
c89700	and on the eighth day of the month came they to the porch of the LORD:
c89701	so they sanctified the house of the LORD in eight days;
c89702	and in the sixteenth day of the first month they made an end.
c89703	Then they went in to Hezekiah the king,
c89704	and said,
c89705	We have cleansed all the house of the LORD, and the altar of burnt offering, with all the vessels thereof, and the shewbread table, with all the vessels thereof.
c89706	Moreover all the vessels,
c89707	which king Ahaz in his reign did cast away in his transgression,
c89708	have we prepared
c89709	and sanctified,
c89710	and, behold, they <i>are</i> before the altar of the LORD.
c89711	Then Hezekiah the king rose early,
c89712	and gathered the rulers of the city,
c89713	and went up to the house of the LORD.
c89714	And they brought seven bullocks, and seven rams, and seven lambs, and seven he goats, for a sin offering for the kingdom, and for the sanctuary, and for Judah.
c89715	And he commanded the priests the sons of Aaron
c89716	to offer <i>them</i> on the altar of the LORD.
c89717	So they killed the bullocks,
c89718	and the priests received the blood,
c89719	and sprinkled <i>it</i> on the altar:
c89720	likewise, when they had killed the rams,
c89721	they sprinkled the blood upon the altar:
c89722	they killed also the lambs,
c89723	and they sprinkled the blood upon the altar.
c89724	And they brought forth the he goats <i>for</i> the sin offering before the king and the congregation;
c89725	and they laid their hands upon them:
c89726	And the priests killed
c89727	them, and they made reconciliation with their blood upon the altar,
c89728	to make an atonement for all Israel:
c89729	for the king commanded <i>that</i> the burnt offering and the sin offering <i>should be made</i> for all Israel.
c89730	And he set the Levites in the house of the LORD with cymbals, with psalteries, and with harps, according to the commandment of David, and of Gad the king's seer, and Nathan the prophet:
c89731	for <i>so was</i> the commandment of the LORD by his prophets.
c89732	And the Levites stood with the instruments of David,
c89733	and the priests with the trumpets.
c89734	And Hezekiah commanded
c89735	to offer the burnt offering upon the altar.
c89736	And when
c89737	the burnt offering began,
c89738	the song of the LORD began <i>also</i> with the trumpets,
c89739	and with the instruments <i>ordained</i> by David king of Israel.
c89740	And all the congregation worshipped,
c89741	and the singers sang,
c89742	and the trumpeters sounded:
c89743	<i>and</i> all
c89744	<i>this continued</i> until the burnt offering was finished.
c89746	And when they had made an end
c89747	of offering,
c89748	the king and all that were present with him bowed
c89750	themselves, and worshipped.
c89751	Moreover Hezekiah the king and the princes commanded the Levites
c89752	to sing praise unto the LORD with the words of David, and of Asaph the seer.
c89753	And they sang praises with gladness,
c89754	and they bowed their heads
c89755	and worshipped.
c89756	Then Hezekiah answered
c89757	and said,
c89758	Now ye have consecrated yourselves unto the LORD,
c89759	come near
c89760	and bring sacrifices and thank offerings into the house of the LORD.
c89761	And the congregation brought in sacrifices and thank offerings;
c89762	and as many as were of a free heart burnt offerings.
c89763	And the number of the burnt offerings, which the congregation brought, was
c89765	threescore and ten bullocks, an hundred rams, <i>and</i> two hundred lambs:
c89766	all these <i>were</i> for a burnt offering to the LORD.
c89767	And the consecrated things <i>were</i> six hundred oxen and three thousand sheep.
c89768	But the priests were too few,
c89769	so that they could not
c89770	flay all the burnt offerings:
c89771	wherefore their brethren the Levites did help
c89772	them, till the work was ended,
c89773	and until the <i>other</i> priests had sanctified themselves:
c89774	for the Levites <i>were</i> more upright in heart
c89775	to sanctify themselves
c89776	than the priests.
c89777	And also the burnt offerings <i>were</i> in abundance, with the fat of the peace offerings, and the drink offerings for <i>every</i> burnt offering.
c89778	So the service of the house of the LORD was set in order.
c89779	And Hezekiah rejoiced, and all the people,
c89780	that God had prepared the people:
c89781	for the thing was <i>done</i> suddenly.
c89782	And Hezekiah sent to all Israel and Judah,
c89783	and wrote letters also to Ephraim and Manasseh,
c89784	that they should come to the house of the LORD at Jerusalem,
c89785	to keep the passover unto the LORD God of Israel.
c89786	For the king had taken counsel, and his princes, and all the congregation in Jerusalem,
c89787	to keep the passover in the second month.
c89788	For they could not
c89789	keep it at that time,
c89790	because the priests had not sanctified themselves sufficiently,
c89791	neither had the people gathered themselves together to Jerusalem.
c89792	And the thing pleased the king and all the congregation.
c89793	So they established a decree
c89794	to make proclamation throughout all Israel, from Beersheba even to Dan,
c89795	that they should come
c89796	to keep the passover unto the LORD God of Israel at Jerusalem:
c89797	for they had not done <i>it</i> of a long <i>time in such sort</i> as it was written.
c89798	So the posts went with the letters from the king and his princes throughout all Israel and Judah,
c89800	and according to the commandment of the king,
c89801	saying,
c89802	Ye children of Israel,
c89803	turn again unto the LORD God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel,
c89804	and he will return to the remnant of you, that are escaped
c89805	out of the hand of the kings of Assyria.
c89806	And be not ye like your fathers, and like your brethren,
c89807	which trespassed against the LORD God of their fathers,
c89808	<i>who</i> therefore gave them up to desolation,
c89809	as ye see.
c89810	Now be ye not stiffnecked, as your fathers
c89811	<i>were, but</i> yield yourselves unto the LORD,
c89812	and enter into his sanctuary,
c89813	which he hath sanctified for ever:
c89814	and serve the LORD your God,
c89815	that the fierceness of his wrath may turn away from you.
c89816	For
c89817	if ye turn again unto the LORD,
c89818	your brethren and your children <i>shall find</i> compassion before them that lead them captive,
c89819	so that they shall come again into this land:
c89820	for the LORD your God <i>is</i> gracious and merciful,
c89821	and will not turn away <i>his</i> face from
c89822	you, if ye return unto him.
c89823	So the posts passed from city to city through the country of Ephraim and Manasseh even unto Zebulun:
c89824	but they laughed them to scorn,
c89825	and mocked them.
c89826	Nevertheless divers of Asher and Manasseh and of Zebulun humbled themselves,
c89827	and came to Jerusalem.
c89828	Also in Judah the hand of God was
c89829	to give them one heart
c89830	to do the commandment of the king and of the princes, by the word of the LORD.
c89831	And there assembled at Jerusalem much people
c89832	to keep the feast of unleavened bread in the second month,
c89833	a very great congregation.
c89834	And they arose
c89835	and took away the altars
c89836	that <i>were</i> in Jerusalem,
c89837	and all the altars for incense took they away,
c89838	and cast <i>them</i> into the brook Kidron.
c89839	Then they killed the passover on the fourteenth <i>day</i> of the second month:
c89840	and the priests and the Levites were ashamed,
c89841	and sanctified themselves,
c89842	and brought in the burnt offerings into the house of the LORD.
c89843	And they stood in their place after their manner, according to the law of Moses the man of God:
c89844	the priests sprinkled the blood, <i>which they received</i> of the hand of the Levites.
c89845	For <i>there were</i> many in the congregation
c89846	that were not sanctified:
c89847	therefore the Levites had the charge of the killing of the passovers for every one
c89848	<i>that was</i> not clean,
c89849	to sanctify <i>them</i> unto the LORD.
c89850	For a multitude of the people, <i>even</i> many of Ephraim, and Manasseh, Issachar, and Zebulun, had not cleansed themselves,
c89851	yet did they eat the passover
c89852	otherwise than it was written.
c89853	But Hezekiah prayed for
c89854	them, saying,
c89855	The good LORD pardon every one
c89857	<i>That</i> prepareth his heart
c89858	to seek God, the LORD God of his fathers,
c89859	though <i>he be</i> not <i>cleansed</i> according to the purification of the sanctuary.
c89860	And the LORD hearkened to Hezekiah,
c89861	and healed the people.
c89862	And the children of Israel that were present at Jerusalem kept
c89864	the feast of unleavened bread seven days with great gladness:
c89865	and the Levites and the priests praised the LORD day by day, <i>singing</i> with loud instruments unto the LORD.
c89866	And Hezekiah spake comfortably unto all the Levites
c89867	that taught the good knowledge of the LORD:
c89868	and they did eat throughout the feast seven days,
c89869	offering peace offerings,
c89870	and making confession to the LORD God of their fathers.
c89871	And the whole assembly took counsel
c89872	to keep other seven days:
c89873	and they kept <i>other</i> seven days with gladness.
c89874	For Hezekiah king of Judah did give to the congregation a thousand bullocks and seven thousand sheep;
c89875	and the princes gave to the congregation a thousand bullocks and ten thousand sheep:
c89876	and a great number of priests sanctified themselves.
c89877	And all the congregation of Judah, with the priests and the Levites, and all the congregation that came out of Israel,
c89879	and the strangers
c89880	that came out of the land of Israel,
c89881	and that dwelt in Judah, rejoiced.
c89882	So there was great joy in Jerusalem:
c89883	for since the time of Solomon the son of David king of Israel <i>there was</i> not the like in Jerusalem.
c89884	Then the priests the Levites arose
c89885	and blessed the people:
c89886	and their voice was heard,
c89887	and their prayer came <i>up</i> to his holy dwelling place, <i>even</i> unto heaven.
c89889	Now when all this was finished,
c89890	all Israel that were present went out
c89892	to the cities of Judah,
c89893	and brake the images in pieces,
c89894	and cut down the groves,
c89895	and threw down the high places and the altars out of all Judah and Benjamin, in Ephraim also and Manasseh,
c89896	until they had utterly destroyed
c89897	them all. Then all the children of Israel returned,
c89898	every man to his possession, into their own cities.
c89899	And Hezekiah appointed the courses of the priests and the Levites after their courses,
c89900	every man according to his service,
c89901	the priests and Levites for burnt offerings and for peace offerings,
c89902	to minister,
c89903	and to give thanks,
c89904	and to praise in the gates of the tents of the LORD.
c89905	<i>He appointed</i> also the king's portion of his substance for the burnt offerings, <i>to wit,</i> for the morning and evening burnt offerings, and the burnt offerings for the sabbaths, and for the new moons, and for the set feasts,
c89906	as <i>it is</i> written in the law of the LORD.
c89907	Moreover he commanded the people that dwelt in Jerusalem
c89908	to give the portion of the priests and the Levites,
c89909	that they might be encouraged in the law of the LORD.
c89911	And as soon as the commandment came abroad,
c89912	the children of Israel brought in abundance the firstfruits of corn, wine, and oil, and honey, and of all the increase of the field;
c89913	and the tithe of all <i>things</i> brought they in abundantly.
c89914	And <i>concerning</i> the children of Israel and Judah,
c89915	that dwelt in the cities of Judah,
c89916	they also brought in the tithe of oxen and sheep, and the tithe of holy things
c89917	which were consecrated unto the LORD their God,
c89919	and laid <i>them</i> by heaps.
c89920	In the third month they began to lay the foundation of the heaps,
c89922	and finished <i>them</i> in the seventh month.
c89923	And when Hezekiah and the princes came
c89924	and saw the heaps,
c89925	they blessed the LORD, and his people Israel.
c89926	Then Hezekiah questioned with the priests and the Levites concerning the heaps.
c89927	And Azariah the chief priest of the house of Zadok answered
c89928	him, and said,
c89929	Since <i>the people</i> began
c89931	to bring the offerings into the house of the LORD,
c89932	to eat,
c89933	we have had enough
c89934	and have left plenty:
c89935	for the LORD hath blessed his people;
c89936	and that which is left <i>is</i> this great store.
c89937	Then Hezekiah commanded
c89938	to prepare chambers in the house of the LORD;
c89939	and they prepared <i>them,</i>
c89940	And brought in the offerings and the tithes and the dedicated <i>things</i> faithfully:
c89941	over which Cononiah the Levite <i>was</i> ruler,
c89942	and Shimei his brother <i>was</i> the next.
c89943	And Jehiel, and Azaziah, and Nahath, and Asahel, and Jerimoth, and Jozabad, and Eliel, and Ismachiah, and Mahath, and Benaiah, <i>were</i> overseers under the hand of Cononiah and Shimei his brother, at the commandment of Hezekiah the king, and Azariah the ruler of the house of God.
c89944	And Kore the son of Imnah the Levite, the porter toward the east, <i>was</i> over the freewill offerings of God,
c89945	to distribute the oblations of the LORD, and the most holy things.
c89946	And next him <i>were</i> Eden, and Miniamin, and Jeshua, and Shemaiah, Amariah, and Shecaniah, in the cities of the priests, in <i>their</i> set office,
c89947	to give to their brethren by courses, as well to the great as to the small:
c89948	Beside their genealogy of males, from three years old and upward,
c89949	<i>even</i> unto every one
c89950	that entereth into the house of the LORD,
c89951	his daily portion for their service in their charges according to their courses;
c89952	Both to the genealogy of the priests by the house of their fathers,
c89953	and the Levites from twenty years old and upward, in their charges by their courses;
c89954	And to the genealogy of all their little ones, their wives, and their sons, and their daughters, through all the congregation:
c89955	for in their set office they sanctified themselves in holiness:
c89956	Also of the sons of Aaron the priests, <i>which were</i> in the fields of the suburbs of their cities, in every several city, the men
c89957	that were expressed by name,
c89958	to give portions to all the males among the priests, and to all
c89959	that were reckoned by genealogies among the Levites.
c89960	And thus did Hezekiah throughout all Judah,
c89961	and wrought <i>that which was</i> good and right and truth before the LORD his God.
c89962	And in every work
c89963	that he began in the service of the house of God, and in the law, and in the commandments,
c89964	to seek his God,
c89965	he did <i>it</i> with all his heart,
c89966	and prospered.
c89967	After these things, and the establishment thereof, Sennacherib king of Assyria came,
c89968	and entered into Judah,
c89969	and encamped against the fenced cities,
c89970	and thought
c89971	to win them for himself.
c89972	And when Hezekiah saw
c89973	that Sennacherib was come,
c89974	and that he was purposed to fight against Jerusalem,
c89975	He took counsel with his princes and his mighty men
c89976	to stop the waters of the fountains
c89977	which <i>were</i> without the city:
c89978	and they did help him.
c89979	So there was gathered much people
c89980	together, who stopped all the fountains, and the brook
c89981	that ran through the midst of the land,
c89982	saying,
c89983	Why should the kings of Assyria come,
c89984	and find much water?
c89985	Also he strengthened himself,
c89986	and built up all the wall that was broken,
c89987	and raised <i>it</i> up to the towers,
c89988	and another wall without,
c89989	and repaired Millo <i>in</i> the city of David,
c89990	and made darts and shields in abundance.
c89992	And he set captains of war over the people,
c89993	and gathered them together to him in the street of the gate of the city,
c89994	and spake comfortably
c89995	to them, saying,
c89996	Be strong
c89997	and courageous,
c89998	be not afraid
c89999	nor dismayed for the king of Assyria, nor for all the multitude
c90000	that <i>is</i> with
c90001	him: for <i>there be</i> more with us than with him:
c90002	With him <i>is</i> an arm of flesh;
c90003	but with us <i>is</i> the LORD our God
c90004	to help
c90005	us, and to fight our battles.
c90006	And the people rested themselves upon the words of Hezekiah king of Judah.
c90007	After this did Sennacherib king of Assyria send his servants to Jerusalem,
c90008	(but he <i>himself laid siege</i> against Lachish,
c90009	and all his power with
c90010	him,) unto Hezekiah king of Judah, and unto all Judah
c90011	that <i>were</i> at Jerusalem,
c90012	saying,
c90013	Thus saith Sennacherib king of Assyria,
c90014	Whereon do ye trust,
c90015	that ye abide in the siege in Jerusalem?
c90016	Doth not Hezekiah persuade
c90017	you to give over
c90018	yourselves to die by famine and by thirst,
c90019	saying,
c90020	The LORD our God shall deliver us out of the hand of the king of Assyria?
c90021	Hath not the same Hezekiah taken away his high places and his altars,
c90022	and commanded Judah and Jerusalem,
c90023	saying,
c90024	Ye shall worship before one altar,
c90025	and burn incense upon it?
c90026	Know ye not
c90027	what I and my fathers have done unto all the people of <i>other</i> lands?
c90028	were the gods of the nations of those lands any ways able
c90029	to deliver their lands out of mine hand?
c90030	Who <i>was there</i> among all the gods of those nations
c90031	that my fathers utterly destroyed,
c90032	that could
c90033	deliver his people out of mine hand,
c90034	that your God should be able
c90035	to deliver you out of mine hand?
c90036	Now
c90037	therefore let not Hezekiah deceive
c90038	you, nor persuade you on this manner,
c90039	neither yet believe
c90040	him: for no god of any nation or kingdom was able
c90041	to deliver his people out of mine hand, and out of the hand of my fathers:
c90042	how much less shall your God deliver you out of mine hand?
c90043	And his servants spake yet <i>more</i> against the LORD God, and against his servant Hezekiah.
c90044	He wrote also letters
c90045	to rail on the LORD God of Israel,
c90046	and to speak against
c90047	him, saying,
c90048	As the gods of the nations of <i>other</i> lands
c90049	have not delivered their people out of mine hand,
c90050	so shall not the God of Hezekiah deliver his people out of mine hand.
c90051	Then they cried with a loud voice in the Jews' speech unto the people of Jerusalem
c90052	that <i>were</i> on the wall,
c90053	to affright
c90054	them, and to trouble
c90055	them; that they might take the city.
c90056	And they spake against the God of Jerusalem, as against the gods of the people of the earth, <i>which were</i> the work of the hands of man.
c90057	And for this <i>cause</i> Hezekiah the king, and the prophet Isaiah the son of Amoz, prayed
c90058	and cried to heaven.
c90059	And the LORD sent an angel,
c90060	which cut off all the mighty men of valour, and the leaders and captains in the camp of the king of Assyria.
c90061	So he returned with shame of face to his own land.
c90062	And when he was come into the house of his god,
c90063	they that came forth of his own bowels slew him there with the sword.
c90064	Thus the LORD saved Hezekiah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem from the hand of Sennacherib the king of Assyria, and from the hand of all
c90065	<i>other,</i> and guided them on every side.
c90066	And many brought gifts unto the LORD to Jerusalem,
c90067	and presents to Hezekiah king of Judah:
c90068	so that he was magnified in the sight of all nations from thenceforth.
c90069	In those days Hezekiah was sick
c90070	to the death,
c90071	and prayed unto the LORD:
c90072	and he spake
c90073	unto him, and he gave him a sign.
c90074	But Hezekiah rendered not again according to the benefit <i>done</i> unto
c90075	him; for his heart was lifted up:
c90076	therefore there was wrath upon
c90077	him, and upon Judah and Jerusalem.
c90078	Notwithstanding Hezekiah humbled himself for the pride of his heart,
c90079	<i>both</i> he and the inhabitants of Jerusalem,
c90080	so that the wrath of the LORD came not upon them in the days of Hezekiah.
c90081	And Hezekiah had exceeding much riches and honour:
c90082	and he made himself treasuries for silver, and for gold, and for precious stones, and for spices, and for shields, and for all manner of pleasant jewels;
c90083	Storehouses also for the increase of corn, and wine, and oil;
c90084	and stalls for all manner of beasts,
c90085	and cotes for flocks.
c90086	Moreover he provided him cities,
c90087	and possessions of flocks and herds in abundance:
c90088	for God had given him substance very much.
c90089	This same Hezekiah also stopped the upper watercourse of Gihon,
c90090	and brought it straight down to the west side of the city of David.
c90091	And Hezekiah prospered in all his works.
c90092	Howbeit in <i>the business of</i> the ambassadors of the princes of Babylon,
c90093	who sent unto
c90094	him to enquire of the wonder
c90095	that was <i>done</i> in the land,
c90096	God left
c90097	him, to try
c90098	him, that he might know all <i>that was</i> in his heart.
c90099	Now the rest of the acts of Hezekiah, and his goodness,
c90100	behold, they <i>are</i> written in the vision of Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz, <i>and</i> in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.
c90101	And Hezekiah slept with his fathers,
c90102	and they buried him in the chiefest of the sepulchres of the sons of David:
c90103	and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem did him honour at his death.
c90104	And Manasseh his son reigned in his stead.
c90105	Manasseh <i>was</i> twelve years old
c90106	when he began to reign,
c90107	and he reigned fifty and five years in Jerusalem:
c90108	But did
c90109	<i>that which was</i> evil in the sight of the LORD,
c90110	like unto the abominations of the heathen,
c90111	whom the LORD had cast out before the children of Israel.
c90113	For he built again the high places
c90114	which Hezekiah his father had broken down,
c90115	and he reared up altars for Baalim,
c90116	and made groves,
c90117	and worshipped all the host of heaven,
c90118	and served them.
c90119	Also he built altars in the house of the LORD,
c90120	whereof the LORD had said,
c90121	In Jerusalem shall my name be for ever.
c90122	And he built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts of the house of the LORD.
c90123	And he caused his children to pass through the fire in the valley of the son of Hinnom:
c90124	also he observed times,
c90125	and used enchantments,
c90126	and used witchcraft,
c90127	and dealt with a familiar spirit, and with wizards:
c90128	much
c90129	he wrought
c90130	evil in the sight of the LORD,
c90131	to provoke him to anger.
c90132	And he set a carved image, the idol
c90133	which he had made,
c90134	in the house of God,
c90135	of which God had said to David and to Solomon his son,
c90136	In this house, and in Jerusalem,
c90137	which I have chosen before all the tribes of Israel,
c90138	will I put my name for ever:
c90139	Neither will I any more
c90140	remove the foot of Israel from out of the land
c90141	which I have appointed for your fathers;
c90142	so that they will take heed
c90143	to do all
c90144	that I have commanded them, according to the whole law and the statutes and the ordinances by the hand of Moses.
c90145	So Manasseh made Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to err,
c90146	<i>and</i> to do worse than the heathen,
c90147	whom the LORD had destroyed before the children of Israel.
c90148	And the LORD spake to Manasseh, and to his people:
c90149	but they would not hearken.
c90150	Wherefore the LORD brought upon them the captains of the host of
c90151	the king of Assyria, which
c90152	took Manasseh among the thorns,
c90153	and bound him with fetters,
c90154	and carried him to Babylon.
c90156	And when he was in affliction,
c90157	he besought the LORD his God,
c90158	and humbled himself greatly before the God of his fathers,
c90159	And prayed unto
c90160	him: and he was intreated
c90161	of him, and heard his supplication,
c90162	and brought him again to Jerusalem into his kingdom.
c90163	Then Manasseh knew
c90164	that the LORD
c90165	he <i>was</i> God.
c90166	Now after this he built a wall without the city of David, on the west side of Gihon, in the valley,
c90167	even to the entering in at the fish gate,
c90168	and compassed about Ophel,
c90169	and raised it up a very great height,
c90170	and put captains of war in all the fenced cities of Judah.
c90171	And he took away the strange gods, and the idol out of the house of the LORD,
c90172	and all the altars
c90173	that he had built in the mount of the house of the LORD, and in Jerusalem,
c90174	and cast <i>them</i> out of the city.
c90175	And he repaired the altar of the LORD,
c90176	and sacrificed thereon peace offerings and thank offerings,
c90177	and commanded Judah
c90178	to serve the LORD God of Israel.
c90179	Nevertheless the people did sacrifice still in the high places,
c90180	<i>yet</i> unto the LORD their God only.
c90181	Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh, and his prayer unto his God, and the words of the seers
c90182	that spake to him in the name of the LORD God of Israel,
c90183	behold, they <i>are written</i> in the book of the kings of Israel.
c90184	His prayer
c90185	also, and <i>how God</i> was intreated
c90186	of him, and all his sin, and his trespass, and the places
c90187	wherein he built high places,
c90188	and set up groves and graven images,
c90189	before he was humbled:
c90190	behold, they <i>are</i> written among the sayings of the seers.
c90191	So Manasseh slept with his fathers,
c90192	and they buried him in his own house:
c90193	and Amon his son reigned in his stead.
c90194	Amon <i>was</i> two and twenty years old
c90195	when he began to reign,
c90196	and reigned two years in Jerusalem.
c90197	But he did
c90198	<i>that which was</i> evil in the sight of the LORD,
c90199	as did Manasseh his father:
c90200	unto all the carved images
c90201	which Manasseh his father had made,
c90202	for Amon sacrificed
c90203	and served them;
c90204	And humbled not himself before the LORD,
c90205	as Manasseh his father had humbled himself;
c90206	but Amon trespassed more and more.
c90207	And his servants conspired against
c90208	him, and slew him in his own house.
c90209	But the people of the land slew all
c90210	them that had conspired against king Amon;
c90211	and the people of the land made Josiah his son king in his stead.
c90212	Josiah <i>was</i> eight years old
c90213	when he began to reign,
c90214	and he reigned in Jerusalem one and thirty years.
c90215	And he did
c90216	<i>that which was</i> right in the sight of the LORD,
c90217	and walked in the ways of David his father,
c90218	and declined <i>neither</i> to the right hand, nor to the left.
c90219	For in the eighth year
c90220	of his reign,
c90221	while he
c90222	was yet young,
c90223	he began
c90224	to seek after the God of David his father:
c90225	and in the twelfth year he began
c90226	to purge Judah and Jerusalem from the high places, and the groves, and the carved images, and the molten images.
c90227	And they brake down the altars of Baalim in his presence;
c90228	and the images,
c90229	that <i>were</i> on high above
c90230	them, he cut down;
c90231	and the groves, and the carved images, and the molten images, he brake in pieces,
c90232	and made dust
c90233	<i>of them,</i> and strowed <i>it</i> upon the graves
c90234	of them that had sacrificed unto them.
c90235	And he burnt the bones of the priests upon their altars,
c90236	and cleansed Judah and Jerusalem.
c90237	And <i>so did he</i> in the cities of Manasseh, and Ephraim, and Simeon, even unto Naphtali, with their mattocks round about.
c90238	And when he had broken down the altars and the groves,
c90239	and had beaten the graven images
c90240	into powder,
c90241	and cut down all the idols throughout all the land of Israel,
c90242	he returned to Jerusalem.
c90243	Now in the eighteenth year
c90244	of his reign,
c90245	when he had purged the land, and the house,
c90246	he sent Shaphan the son of Azaliah, and Maaseiah the governor of the city, and Joah the son of Joahaz the recorder,
c90247	to repair the house of the LORD his God.
c90248	And when they came to Hilkiah the high priest,
c90249	they delivered the money
c90250	that was brought into the house of God,
c90251	which the Levites that kept the doors had gathered of the hand of Manasseh and Ephraim, and of all the remnant of Israel, and of all Judah and Benjamin;
c90252	and they returned to Jerusalem.
c90253	And they put <i>it</i> in the hand of the workmen
c90254	that had the oversight of the house of the LORD,
c90255	and they gave it to the workmen
c90256	that wrought in the house of the LORD,
c90257	to repair
c90258	and amend the house:
c90259	Even to the artificers and builders gave
c90260	they <i>it,</i> to buy hewn stone, and timber for couplings,
c90261	and to floor the houses
c90262	which the kings of Judah had destroyed.
c90263	And the men did the work faithfully:
c90264	of them <i>were</i> Jahath and Obadiah, the Levites, of the sons of Merari; and Zechariah and Meshullam, of the sons of the Kohathites, to set <i>it</i> forward;
c90265	and the overseers
c90266	and <i>other of</i> the Levites, all
c90267	that could skill of instruments of musick.
c90268	Also <i>they were</i> over the bearers of burdens,
c90269	and <i>were</i> overseers of all that wrought the work in any manner of service:
c90270	and of the Levites <i>there were</i> scribes, and officers, and porters.
c90272	And when they brought out the money
c90273	that was brought into the house of the LORD,
c90274	Hilkiah the priest found a book of the law of the LORD <i>given</i> by Moses.
c90275	And Hilkiah answered
c90276	and said to Shaphan the scribe,
c90277	I have found the book of the law in the house of the LORD.
c90278	And Hilkiah delivered the book to Shaphan.
c90279	And Shaphan carried the book to the king,
c90280	and brought the king word back again,
c90281	saying,
c90282	All
c90283	that was committed to thy servants,
c90284	they do <i>it.</i>
c90285	And they have gathered together the money
c90286	that was found in the house of the LORD,
c90287	and have delivered it into the hand of the overseers, and to the hand of the workmen.
c90288	Then Shaphan the scribe told the king,
c90289	saying,
c90290	Hilkiah the priest hath given me a book.
c90291	And Shaphan read it before the king.
c90292	And it came to pass,
c90293	when the king had heard the words of the law,
c90294	that he rent his clothes.
c90295	And the king commanded Hilkiah, and Ahikam the son of Shaphan, and Abdon the son of Micah, and Shaphan the scribe, and Asaiah a servant of the king's,
c90296	saying,
c90297	Go,
c90298	enquire of the LORD for
c90299	me, and for them that are left in Israel and in Judah,
c90300	concerning the words of the book
c90301	that is found:
c90302	for great <i>is</i> the wrath of the LORD
c90303	that is poured out
c90304	upon us, because our fathers have not kept the word of the LORD,
c90305	to do after all
c90306	that is written in this book.
c90307	And Hilkiah, and <i>they</i> that the king <i>had appointed,</i> went
c90309	to Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son of Tikvath, the son of Hasrah,
c90310	keeper of the wardrobe;
c90311	(now she dwelt in Jerusalem in the college:)
c90312	and they spake to her to that <i>effect.</i>
c90313	And she answered
c90314	them, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel,
c90315	Tell ye the man
c90316	that sent you to me,
c90317	Thus saith the LORD,
c90318	Behold, I will bring evil upon this place, and upon the inhabitants
c90319	thereof, <i>even</i> all the curses
c90320	that are written in the book
c90321	which they have read before the king of Judah:
c90322	Because they have forsaken
c90323	me, and have burned incense unto other gods,
c90324	that they might provoke me to anger with all the works of their hands;
c90325	therefore my wrath shall be poured out upon this place,
c90326	and shall not be quenched.
c90327	And as for the king of Judah,
c90328	who sent
c90329	you to enquire of the LORD,
c90330	so shall ye say unto
c90331	him, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel
c90332	<i>concerning</i> the words
c90333	which thou hast heard;
c90334	Because thine heart was tender,
c90335	and thou didst humble thyself before God,
c90336	when thou heardest his words against this place, and against the inhabitants
c90337	thereof, and humbledst thyself before
c90338	me, and didst rend thy clothes,
c90339	and weep before
c90340	me; I have even heard <i>thee</i> also,
c90341	saith the LORD.
c90342	Behold, I will gather thee to thy fathers,
c90343	and thou shalt be gathered to thy grave in peace,
c90344	neither shall thine eyes see all the evil
c90345	that I will bring upon this place, and upon the inhabitants
c90346	of the same. So they brought the king word again.
c90347	Then the king sent
c90348	and gathered together all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem.
c90349	And the king went up into the house of the LORD,
c90350	and all the men of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and the priests, and the Levites, and all the people, great and small:
c90351	and he read in their ears all the words of the book of the covenant
c90352	that was found in the house of the LORD.
c90353	And the king stood in his place,
c90354	and made a covenant before the LORD,
c90355	to walk after the LORD,
c90356	and to keep his commandments, and his testimonies, and his statutes, with all his heart, and with all his soul,
c90357	to perform the words of the covenant
c90358	which are written in this book.
c90359	And he caused all that were present in Jerusalem and Benjamin to stand
c90361	<i>to it.</i> And the inhabitants of Jerusalem did according to the covenant of God, the God of their fathers.
c90362	And Josiah took away all the abominations out of all the countries
c90363	that <i>pertained</i> to the children of Israel,
c90364	and made all that were present in Israel to serve,
c90366	<i>even</i> to serve the LORD their God.
c90367	<i>And</i> all his days they departed not from following the LORD, the God of their fathers.
c90368	Moreover Josiah kept a passover unto the LORD in Jerusalem:
c90369	and they killed the passover on the fourteenth <i>day</i> of the first month.
c90370	And he set the priests in their charges,
c90371	and encouraged them to the service of the house of the LORD,
c90372	And said unto the Levites
c90373	that taught all Israel,
c90374	which were holy unto the LORD,
c90375	Put the holy ark in the house
c90376	which Solomon the son of David king of Israel did build;
c90377	<i>it shall</i> not <i>be</i> a burden upon <i>your</i> shoulders:
c90378	serve now the LORD your God, and his people Israel,
c90379	And prepare <i>yourselves</i> by the houses of your fathers, after your courses, according to the writing of David king of Israel, and according to the writing of Solomon his son.
c90380	And stand in the holy <i>place</i> according to the divisions of the families of the fathers of your brethren the people,
c90381	and <i>after</i> the division of the families of the Levites.
c90382	So kill the passover,
c90383	and sanctify yourselves,
c90384	and prepare your brethren,
c90385	that <i>they</i> may do according to the word of the LORD by the hand of Moses.
c90386	And Josiah gave to the people, of the flock, lambs and kids,
c90387	all for the passover offerings, for all
c90388	that were present,
c90389	to the number of thirty thousand,
c90390	and three thousand bullocks:
c90391	these <i>were</i> of the king's substance.
c90392	And his princes gave willingly unto the people, to the priests, and to the Levites:
c90393	Hilkiah and Zechariah and Jehiel, rulers of the house of God, gave unto the priests for the passover offerings two thousand and six hundred <i>small cattle,</i> and three hundred oxen.
c90394	Conaniah also, and Shemaiah and Nethaneel, his brethren, and Hashabiah and Jeiel and Jozabad, chief of the Levites, gave unto the Levites for passover offerings five thousand <i>small cattle,</i> and five hundred oxen.
c90395	So the service was prepared,
c90396	and the priests stood in their place,
c90397	and the Levites in their courses,
c90398	according to the king's commandment.
c90399	And they killed the passover,
c90400	and the priests sprinkled <i>the blood</i> from their hands,
c90401	and the Levites flayed <i>them.</i>
c90402	And they removed the burnt offerings,
c90403	that they might give according to the divisions of the families of the people,
c90404	to offer unto the LORD,
c90405	as <i>it is</i> written in the book of Moses.
c90406	And so <i>did they</i> with the oxen.
c90407	And they roasted the passover with fire according to the ordinance:
c90408	but the <i>other</i> holy <i>offerings</i> sod they in pots, and in caldrons, and in pans,
c90409	and divided <i>them</i> speedily among all the people.
c90410	And afterward they made ready for themselves, and for the priests:
c90411	because the priests the sons of Aaron
c90412	<i>were busied</i> in offering of burnt offerings and the fat until night;
c90413	therefore the Levites prepared for themselves, and for the priests the sons of Aaron.
c90414	And the singers the sons of Asaph <i>were</i> in their place, according to the commandment of David, and Asaph, and Heman, and Jeduthun the king's seer;
c90415	and the porters <i>waited</i> at every gate;
c90416	they might not
c90417	depart from their service;
c90418	for their brethren the Levites prepared for them.
c90419	So all the service of the LORD was prepared the same day,
c90420	to keep the passover,
c90421	and to offer burnt offerings upon the altar of the LORD, according to the commandment of king Josiah.
c90422	And the children of Israel that were present kept
c90424	the passover at that time,
c90425	and the feast of unleavened bread seven days.
c90426	And there was no passover like to that kept in Israel from the days of Samuel the prophet;
c90427	neither did all the kings of Israel keep such a passover
c90428	as Josiah kept, and the priests, and the Levites, and all Judah and Israel
c90429	that were present,
c90430	and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
c90431	In the eighteenth year of the reign of Josiah was this passover kept.
c90432	After all this,
c90433	when Josiah had prepared the temple,
c90434	Necho king of Egypt came up
c90435	to fight against Carchemish by Euphrates:
c90436	went out
c90437	against him.
c90438	and Josiah
c90439	But he sent ambassadors to
c90440	him, saying,
c90441	What
c90442	have I to do with thee, thou king of Judah?
c90443	<i>I come</i> not against thee this day,
c90444	but against the house wherewith I have war:
c90445	for God commanded
c90446	me to make haste:
c90447	forbear thee from <i>meddling with</i> God,
c90448	who <i>is</i> with
c90449	me, that he destroy thee not.
c90450	Nevertheless Josiah would not turn his face from
c90451	him, but
c90452	that he might fight
c90453	disguised himself,
c90454	with him, and hearkened not unto the words of Necho from the mouth of God,
c90455	and came
c90456	to fight in the valley of Megiddo.
c90457	And the archers shot at king Josiah;
c90458	and the king said to his servants,
c90459	Have me away;
c90460	for I am sore wounded.
c90461	His servants therefore took him out of that chariot,
c90462	and put him in the second chariot
c90463	that
c90464	he had; and they brought him to Jerusalem,
c90465	and he died,
c90466	and was buried in <i>one of</i> the sepulchres of his fathers.
c90467	And all Judah and Jerusalem mourned for Josiah.
c90468	And Jeremiah lamented for Josiah:
c90469	and all the singing men and the singing women spake of Josiah in their lamentations to this day,
c90470	and made them an ordinance in Israel:
c90471	and, behold, they <i>are</i> written in the lamentations.
c90472	Now the rest of the acts of Josiah, and his goodness,
c90473	according to <i>that which was</i> written in the law of the LORD,
c90474	And his deeds, first and last,
c90475	behold, they <i>are</i> written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah.
c90476	Then the people of the land took Jehoahaz the son of Josiah,
c90477	and made him king in his father's stead in Jerusalem.
c90478	Jehoahaz <i>was</i> twenty and three years old
c90479	when he began to reign,
c90480	and he reigned three months in Jerusalem.
c90481	And the king of Egypt put him down at Jerusalem,
c90482	and condemned the land in an hundred talents of silver and a talent of gold.
c90483	And the king of Egypt made Eliakim his brother king over Judah and Jerusalem,
c90484	and turned his name to Jehoiakim.
c90485	And Necho took Jehoahaz his brother,
c90486	and carried him to Egypt.
c90487	Jehoiakim <i>was</i> twenty and five years old
c90488	when he began to reign,
c90489	and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem:
c90490	and he did
c90491	<i>that which was</i> evil in the sight of the LORD his God.
c90492	Against him came up Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon,
c90493	and bound him in fetters,
c90494	to carry him to Babylon.
c90495	Nebuchadnezzar also carried of the vessels of the house of the LORD to Babylon,
c90496	and put them in his temple at Babylon.
c90497	Now the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim, and his abominations
c90498	which he did,
c90499	and that which was found in
c90500	him, behold, they <i>are</i> written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah:
c90501	and Jehoiachin his son reigned in his stead.
c90502	Jehoiachin <i>was</i> eight years old
c90503	when he began to reign,
c90504	and he reigned three months and ten days in Jerusalem:
c90505	and he did
c90506	<i>that which was</i> evil in the sight of the LORD.
c90507	And when the year was expired, king Nebuchadnezzar sent,
c90508	and brought him to Babylon, with the goodly vessels of the house of the LORD,
c90509	and made Zedekiah his brother king over Judah and Jerusalem.
c90510	Zedekiah <i>was</i> one and twenty years old
c90511	when he began to reign,
c90512	and reigned eleven years in Jerusalem.
c90513	And he did
c90514	<i>that which was</i> evil in the sight of the LORD his God,
c90515	<i>and</i> humbled not himself before Jeremiah the prophet <i>speaking</i> from the mouth of the LORD.
c90516	And he also rebelled against king Nebuchadnezzar,
c90517	who had made him swear by God:
c90518	but he stiffened his neck,
c90519	and hardened his heart
c90520	from turning unto the LORD God of Israel.
c90521	Moreover all the chief of the priests, and the people, transgressed very much
c90522	after all the abominations of the heathen;
c90523	and polluted the house of the LORD
c90524	which he had hallowed in Jerusalem.
c90525	And the LORD God of their fathers sent to them by his messengers, rising up betimes, and sending;
c90526	because he had compassion on his people, and on his dwelling place:
c90527	But they mocked the messengers of God,
c90528	and despised his words,
c90529	and misused his prophets,
c90530	until the wrath of the LORD arose against his people, till <i>there was</i> no remedy.
c90531	Therefore he brought upon them the king of the Chaldees,
c90532	who slew their young men with the sword in the house of their sanctuary,
c90533	and had no compassion upon young man or maiden, old man, or him that stooped for age:
c90534	he gave <i>them</i> all into his hand.
c90535	And all the vessels of the house of God, great and small, and the treasures of the house of the LORD, and the treasures of the king, and of his princes;
c90536	all <i>these</i> he brought to Babylon.
c90537	And they burnt the house of God,
c90538	and brake down the wall of Jerusalem,
c90539	and burnt all the palaces thereof with fire,
c90540	all the goodly vessels thereof.
c90541	and destroyed
c90542	And them that had escaped from the sword carried he away to Babylon;
c90543	where they were servants to him and his sons
c90544	until the reign of the kingdom of Persia:
c90545	To fulfil the word of the LORD by the mouth of Jeremiah,
c90546	until the land had enjoyed her sabbaths:
c90547	<i>for</i> as long as she lay desolate she kept sabbath,
c90548	to fulfil threescore and ten years.
c90549	Now in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia,
c90550	that the word of the LORD <i>spoken</i> by the mouth of Jeremiah might be accomplished,
c90551	the LORD stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia,
c90552	that he made a proclamation throughout all his kingdom,
c90553	and <i>put it</i> also in writing,
c90554	saying,
c90555	Thus saith Cyrus king of Persia,
c90556	All the kingdoms of the earth hath the LORD God of heaven given
c90557	me; and he hath charged
c90558	me to build him an house in Jerusalem,
c90559	which <i>is</i> in Judah.
c90560	Who <i>is there</i> among you of all his people?
c90561	The LORD his God <i>be</i> with
c90562	him, and let him go up.
